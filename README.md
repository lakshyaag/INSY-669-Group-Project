## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment of management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections of 10-K filings of companies in the S&P 500 index and predict the stock price movement of the company. This will then be tested against the actual stock price movement of the company to determine the accuracy of the model.
