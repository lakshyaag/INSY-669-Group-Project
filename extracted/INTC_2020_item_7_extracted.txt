Market and Business Overview 

Market Trends and Strategy 

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global vehicle industry, resulting in a year over year decline in overall production of approximately 17% 3 , and delayed deployment of certain OEMs' advanced features and other projects. We expect ADAS volume to recover from the effects of COVID-19 faster than overall global vehicle production, and we expect long-term growth of ADAS to remain unaffected as consumers increasingly consider ADAS a differentiating factor in their automotive purchasing decisions. 

The continued growth of ADAS is dependent on various factors, including regulation, market demand, and consumers' recognition of its value. Mobileye's ADAS solutions also serve as a qualification space for our autonomous technology, using vast experience and proliferation to validate and constantly improve AV technology. This year, we introduced Mobileye Supervision, the EyeQ5-based solution that incorporates an end-to-end engine control unit, surround-view camera array, processors, driving policy, and high-definition maps&#8212;all derived directly from our ongoing autonomous vehicle program. AV technologies such as Mobileye Supervision will make their way into premium ADAS solutions, broadening monetization opportunities and value proposition.

Despite the COVID-19-related impact on vehicle production, OEMs are still looking to enhance current L2+ solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and performance. High-definition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and various semantic features are prerequisites for L2+ applications and the future deployment of robotaxi and passenger car autonomy (Consumer AV). Canonical mapping methods rely on extensive manual labor and dedicated mapping vehicles. Mobileye's disruptive REM crowdsource mapping technology provides automatic map creation and updates. REM mapping capabilities are also being leveraged to extend the value of static and dynamic data to businesses in new market segments such as smart cities and infrastructure surveys. 

We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial robotaxi and series-production passenger car consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulatory framework, and public acceptance. Thus, we see the robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to consumer AV. Mobileye is well-positioned to play a significant role in the broader MaaS market with the commercialization of robotaxi and the future consumer AV market. Our full-stack self-driving system&#8212;geared with our camera-centric backbone and vast experience in productizing cutting-edge technology in the automotive industry&#8212;is the foundation for developing an economically competitive AV solution. Proliferation of data-collection vehicles alongside REM technology will allow for low-cost geographic expansion and coverage. Together with Moovit's complementary assets in the service layers, Mobileye is building itself as an end-to-end service provider at scale. 

Until the UNECE, EU, and U.S. provide regulation for self-driving vehicles without safety drivers for commercial ride sharing and public transportation, several countries are pushing to enact laws and regulation by 2021 to enable regular deployment and operation of MaaS fleets with self-driving vehicles starting in 2022. 

Products and Competitiveness 

Our offering for ADAS and AV is propelled by our computer vision and AI expertise and software assets, deployed on our EyeQ SoC family. The tight co-design of hardware and software gives the EyeQ SoC the ability to support complex and computationally intense tasks and sets it apart from competition because it is purpose-fit for high-compute, low-power, automotive-compliant mission profiles. Our 5th Gen EyeQ5 SoC is designed to act as the central computer for fully autonomous driving vehicles. We have been able to achieve power, performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ5, we are supporting an automotive-grade standard operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to differentiate their solutions by deploying their algorithms on EyeQ5. The EyeQ5 SoC is expected to be in commercial vehicles starting in 2021 and is already operational in our autonomous test vehicles. 

EyeQ5 serves as the computational foundation for our scalable camera-only surround sensing system. The system consists of multiple independent computer vision engines and deep networks for algorithmic redundancy. The result is a robust and comprehensive model of the environment that allows end-to-end autonomous driving. The surround computer vision system is the backbone of Mobileye's AV architecture and the flagship offering for next-generation ADAS. 

The next significant building block in our complete offering is REM mapping technology, which compiles crowdsourced mapping data from EyeQ SoC-equipped vehicles. We are focused on our crowd-sourced mapping efforts and expect a significant increase in harvesting capabilities in 2021. We also expect an expansion of the number of vehicles using our localization capabilities by the end of 2021. The REM Roadbook TM can enhance current ADAS applications through a variety of advanced features, including predictive adaptive cruise control, lane-level localization in all weather and road conditions, hands-free driving application, and real-time alerts. 

Leveraging this data, we launched a full suite of vision-based data services for cities, road operators, transportation authorities, and mapping companies. Using vehicles equipped with Mobileye's road mapping technology, we provide highly refreshed geographic information systems data about the road network, infrastructure assets, pavement condition, mobility, and traffic. This information allows our customers to monitor and preserve their infrastructure more efficiently, making roadways and streets safer for all. 

The third building block in our full stack offering is our unique formal model for AV safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to design and then efficiently validate the safety of an AV, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS formalizes human decision making for safe driving under two main principles: first, it acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful driving by making plausible worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users; and second, it provides a technology-neutral model and a transparent framework for the regulatory endeavor of building an industry standard for safety. In late 2019, Intel was named to lead the IEEE working group to develop AV decision making standards. 

These building blocks are already part of our recently launched Mobileye Supervision, a direct derivative of our autonomous driving program. This solution proves that there is a valuable use case for AV technology in the most advanced driver-assistance systems.

Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net 

Ongoing mark-to-market net gains and losses reported during 2020 were primarily driven by Montage Technology, Co. Ltd. (Montage); 2019 and 2018 net gains and losses were primarily driven by ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) and Cloudera. In 2019, we sold our equity investment in ASML. 

During 2020, we recognized higher than historically experienced impairment charges on our non-marketable portfolio based on our assessment of the impact of recent public and private market volatility and tightening of liquidity. We recognized impairments of $290 million on non-marketable equity securities ($122 million in 2019 and $132 million in 2018). In 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $290 million in our equity method investment in IMFT. 

In sale of equity investments and other, we recognized $1.1 billion on the initial fair value adjustment from a Montage holding becoming marketable and $606 million related to four other equity investments that went public in 2020. We recognized McAfee dividends of $126 million in 2020 and $632 million in 2019, and in 2019 we recognized $107 million from our sale of our non-controlling interest in IMFT. 

Interest and Other, Net 

We recognized a net loss in interest and other in 2020 compared to a net gain in 2019, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2020 compared to 2019. 

We recognized a higher net gain in interest and other in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower loss on debt conversions and larger divestiture gains in 2019 compared to 2018.

Our effective tax rate increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our planned divestiture of the NAND memory business. It also increased due to the reduction in our foreign derived intangible income benefit in 2020. 

Our effective tax rate increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by one-time benefits that occurred in 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: 

##TABLE_START (In Millions) Dec 26, 2020 Dec 28, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets $ 23,895 $ 13,123 Other long-term investments $ 2,192 $ 3,276 Loans receivable and other $ 947 $ 1,239 Reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months $ &#8212; $ 350 Total debt $ 36,401 $ 29,001 Temporary equity $ &#8212; $ 155 ##TABLE_END

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. When assessing our sources of liquidity, we include cash and investments as shown in the preceding table. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities. 

Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of December 26, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. During 2020, we issued a total of $10.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and repaid $1.0 billion of our 1.85% senior notes that matured in May 2020 and $1.8 billion of our 2.45% senior notes that matured in July 2020. We also repaid $700 million in floating-rate senior notes that matured in May 2020. Additionally, we paid $1.1 billion to satisfy conversion obligations for the remaining $372 million of our $2.0 billion 2009 Debentures. 

On March 24, 2020, we suspended the use of our financial resources for stock repurchases. On August 19, 2020, in response to our belief that our stock was trading well below its intrinsic valuation at that time, we entered into ASR agreements to repurchase an aggregate of $10.0 billion of our common stock. In total, we have repurchased approximately $17.6 billion in shares as part of our planned $20.0 billion share repurchases announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the remaining $2.4 billion balance of these planned repurchases in Q1 2021. 

We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, dividends, and common stock repurchases.

In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows: 

##TABLE_START Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 26, 2020 Dec 28, 2019 Dec 29, 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 35,384 $ 33,145 $ 29,432 Net cash used for investing activities (20,796) (14,405) (11,239) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (12,917) (17,565) (18,607) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,671 &#160; $ 1,175 &#160; $ (414) ##TABLE_END

Operating Activities 

Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. 

For 2020 compared to 2019, the $2.2 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by accounts receivable, inventory, and income taxes, offset by other assets and liabilities. 

For 2019 compared to 2018, the $3.7 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by taxes, other assets and liabilities, and accounts receivable, offset by customer utilization of prepaid supply agreement payments and inventory build. 

Investing Activities 

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals, and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $14.3 billion in 2020, excluding NAND capital expenditures subsequent to the held for sale date ($16.2 billion in 2019 and $15.2 billion in 2018). 

The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments and trading assets, offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale debt investments and trading assets, and a decrease in capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. 

The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to net trading asset activity, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. The increase was partially offset by net available-for-sale debt investment activity. 

Financing Activities 

Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans. 

The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by long-term debt issuances, offset by an increase in repayments of debt and debt conversions and an increase in repurchases of common stock. During 2020, we repurchased $14.2 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $13.6 billion in 2019. As of December 26, 2020, $9.7 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the repurchase authorization limit. Our total dividend payments were $5.6 billion in 2020 compared to $5.6 billion in 2019. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 113 quarters. 

The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased long-term debt issuance, offset by increased repurchases of common stock.

1 Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases, but exclude non-lease components. 

2 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 26, 2020, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property. 

3 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. 

4 Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further information, see "Note 8: Income Taxes" within the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

5 Amounts represent principal payments for all debt obligations and interest payments for fixed-rate debt obligations. Interest payments on floating-rate debt obligations, as well as the impact of fixed-rate to floating-rate debt swaps, are excluded. 

6 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table because they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid. 

7 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. 

The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. 

Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. 

For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 

Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. Approximately half of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 26, 2020, assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $530 million. 

For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.
