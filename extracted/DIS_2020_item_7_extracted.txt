SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS 

Strategic Reorganization 

In October 2020, the Company announced a strategic reorganization of our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate the growth of our DTC strategy. The operations of the Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and DTCI segments were reorganized into four groups: three content groups (Studios, General Entertainment and Sports), which are focused on developing and producing content that will be used across all of our traditional and DTC platforms and a distribution group, which is focused on distribution and commercialization activities across these platforms and which has full accountability for media and entertainment operating results globally. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

During fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at Parks, Experiences and Products where our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year, cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year. We also had an adverse impact on our merchandise licensing business. Our Studio Entertainment segment has delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled, theatrical releases, and stage play performances have been suspended since late in the second quarter. We also had adverse impacts on advertising sales at Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International. Since March 2020, we have experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the shift of key live sports programming from our third quarter to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021, as well as the suspension of production of most film and television content since late in the second quarter, although some film and television production resumed in the fourth quarter. 

We have taken a number of mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses. We have significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in March and May 2020, and we entered into an additional $5.0 billion credit facility in April 2020. The Company (or our Board of Directors, as applicable) did not declare a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations; suspended certain capital projects; reduced certain discretionary expenditures (such as spending on marketing); reduced management compensation for several months and temporarily eliminated Board of Director retainers and committee fees. In addition, we furloughed over 120,000 of our employees (who continued to receive Company provided medical benefits), many of which have returned from furlough as certain business operations have reopened. At the end of September, the Company announced a workforce reduction plan that would primarily impact Parks, Experiences and Products. Overall, approximately 32,000 employees will be terminated in the first half of fiscal 2021. We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; reducing, or not making, certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; further suspending capital spending, reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our businesses. 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

The most significant impact of COVID-19 on fiscal 2020 operating results was an estimated detriment of approximately $6.9 billion on operating income at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment due to revenue lost as a result of the closures or reduced operating capacities. The impacts at the Media Networks, Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International and Studio Entertainment segments were less significant. Media Networks had a modest benefit reflecting the deferral of sports programming costs to fiscal 2021, when we expect rescheduled events to occur, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. At Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International, lower advertising revenue was partially offset by lower costs including the deferral of sports programming costs into fiscal 2021. At Studio Entertainment, lower revenues due to the deferral or cancellation of significant film releases as a result of theater closures were partially offset by lower amortization, marketing and distribution costs. In total, we estimate the net adverse impact of COVID-19 on our full year segment operating income across all of our businesses was approximately $7.4 billion, inclusive of the impact at Parks, Experiences and Products. The estimated impact is net of approximately $500 million in government credits, from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) in the U.S. and a similar program in France, both primarily at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The impact in fiscal 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the impact on future period results, including the impact of sports programming cost deferrals. 

The impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals&#8217; and companies&#8217; risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. While we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impacts of COVID-19, we currently expect COVID-19 to adversely impact our financial results at least through fiscal 2021. 

Some of our businesses have reopened with limited operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, talent and guests. For example, as we reopened theme parks and retail stores, we incurred and will continue to incur costs for such things as additional custodial services, personal protection equipment, temperature screenings and testing, sanitizer and cleaning supplies and signage, among other items. As we resume production of film and television content, including live sporting events, we anticipate incurring similar costs and productions may take longer to complete. The timing, duration and extent of these costs will depend on the timing and scope of the resumption of our operations. We currently estimate these costs may total approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2021. Some of these costs may be capitalized and amortized over future periods. With the unknown duration of COVID-19 and yet to be determined timing of the phased reopening of certain businesses, it is not possible to precisely estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in future quarters. As we reopen our businesses, we will no longer benefit from certain savings related to the closure of those businesses, such as related furloughs. The reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements, which vary by location, are subject to ongoing changes, which could result from increasing COVID-19 cases. 

Additionally, see Part I., Item 1A. Risk Factors - The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue. 

Direct-to-Consumer 

In November 2019, the Company launched Disney+, a subscription based DTC streaming service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming in the U.S. and four other countries and has expanded to select Western European countries in the Spring of 2020. In April 2020, our Hotstar service in India was converted to Disney+Hotstar, and in June 2020, current subscribers of the Disney Deluxe service in Japan were converted to Disney+. In September 2020, Disney+ was launched in additional European countries and Disney+ Hotstar was launched in Indonesia. In November 2020, Disney+ was launched in Latin America. Additional launches are planned for various Asia-Pacific territories in calendar year 2021. 

The Company also plans to launch a general entertainment DTC video streaming offering under the Star brand outside the U.S. in calendar year 2021. 

As we will use our branded film and television content on our DTC offerings, we are forgoing certain licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in TV/SVOD markets. We also expect to forgo revenue as we shut down channels in certain markets as a result of investment in our DTC offerings. In addition, we are increasing programming and production investments to create exclusive content for our DTC offerings. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMS 

Fiscal 2019 includes the consolidated results of TFCF and Hulu for the period March 20, 2019 through September 28, 2019, whereas the fiscal 2020 results include the consolidated results of TFCF and Hulu for the full year. We refer to the impact of the approximately six month non-comparable period as &#8220;the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu&#8221;. 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

The Company&#8217;s fiscal year end is on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. Fiscal 2020 is a fifty-three week year, which began on September 29, 2019 and ended on October 3, 2020. We estimate that the additional week of operations in fiscal 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre-tax income of approximately $200 million, primarily at the Media Networks segment. 

Revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased 6%, or $4.2 billion, to $65.4 billion; net income attributable to Disney decreased $13.9 billion, to a loss of $2.9 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney decreased to a loss of $1.57 compared to income of $6.26 in the prior year. The EPS decrease for the year was due to lower segment operating income, goodwill and intangible asset impairments at our International Channels business, the comparison to a prior-year non-cash gain in connection with the acquisition of Hulu (Hulu gain), higher amortization of intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs from the TFCF acquisition and the consolidation of Hulu and higher interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by an investment gain in the current year and the comparison to investment impairments and a charge for the extinguishment of debt recorded in the prior year. The decrease in segment operating income was due to lower results at Parks, Experiences and Products and higher losses at Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International, partially offset by an increase at our Media Networks segment. Segment operating results for the current period include a $0.5 billion net benefit from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu. 

Revenues 

Service revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased 2%, or $1.3 billion, to $59.3 billion, driven by lower volumes at our theme parks, resorts and cruise line, a decrease in theatrical distribution and stage play revenues, lower advertising revenue and a decrease in sales of our television and film programs to third parties. These decreases were partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu and an increase in subscription revenue from Disney+/Disney+Hotstar and Hulu. Theme park, resort, cruise line, theatrical distribution, stage play and advertising revenue were adversely impacted by COVID-19. 

Product revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased 32%, or $2.9 billion, to $6.1 billion, due to lower volumes at our theme parks and resorts, which were impacted by being closed or operating at reduced capacity for a significant part of the year as a result of COVID-19. 

Costs and expenses 

Cost of services for fiscal 2020 increased 8%, or $2.9 billion, to $39.4 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by lower theatrical and TV/SVOD production cost amortization and distribution costs and decreased volumes at our theme parks, resorts and cruise line. The increase in programming and production costs reflected costs for Disney+ programming, partially offset by a decrease due to a shift in timing of major sporting events to fiscal 2021. 

Cost of products for fiscal 2020 decreased 20%, or $1.1 billion, to $4.5 billion, due to lower volumes at our theme parks and resorts. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2020 increased 7%, or $0.8 billion, to $12.4 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu, partially offset by lower marketing costs. The decrease in marketing costs reflected lower spending at the theatrical distribution and theme parks and resorts businesses, partially offset by increased spend for Disney+. 

Depreciation and amortization costs increased 28%, or $1.2 billion, to $5.3 billion due to the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of TFCF and consolidation of Hulu and, to a lesser extent, higher depreciation for new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. 

Restructuring and Impairment Charges 

Restructuring and impairment charges of $5.7 billion for fiscal 2020 were due to $ 4,953 million of impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels business and $782 million of restructuring costs. Restructuring costs were primarily for severance costs and contract termination charges in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF and severance in connection with the reduction-in-force at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. 

Restructuring and impairment charges of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2019 were primarily for severance and equity-based compensation costs in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF.

In fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of $ 973 million to adjust its investment in DraftKings, Inc. to fair value (DraftKings gain). In addition, the Company recognized a gain of $ 65 million on the sale of an investment. 

In fiscal 2019, the Company recognized the $ 4,794 million Hulu gain, recorded insurance recoveries of $ 46 million in connection with the settlement of legal matters, and recorded a gain of $28 million on the deemed settlement of preexisting relationships with TFCF pursuant to acquisition accounting guidance. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $ 511 million for the extinguishment of a portion of the debt originally assumed in the TFCF acquisition.

The increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. 

The decrease in interest income, investment income and other was due to a lower benefit from pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost and higher net investment impairments, partially offset by higher imputed interest income on long-term receivables for film and television program sales driven by the consolidation of TFCF. 

Equity in the Income (Loss) of Investees 

Equity in the income (loss) of investees reflected income of $ 651 million in the current year compared to a loss of $ 103 million in the prior year. The change reflected the comparison to impairments in the prior year on our investment in Vice Group Holding Inc. and on an investment in a cable channel at A+E Television Networks and lower equity losses from Hulu as a result of our consolidation of Hulu following the TFCF acquisition. 

Effective Income Tax Rate 

##TABLE_START 2020 2019 Change Better (Worse) Effective income tax rate - continuing operations (40.1)% 21.7% (61.8) ppt ##TABLE_END

The change in effective income tax rate is due to the fiscal 2020 impairment of International Channels goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and foreign losses in fiscal 2020 for which we are unable to recognize a tax benefit.

The decrease in net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by a higher adverse impact from the accretion of the Hulu redeemable noncontrolling interest due to the consolidation of Hulu. 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS &#8212; 2020 vs. 2019 

Below is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses. 

Our Media Networks segment primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising (excluding addressable ad sales) and the sale and distribution of television programs in TV/SVOD markets. Significant expenses include amortization of programming and production costs, participations and residuals expense, technical support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. 

Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing intellectual properties and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include information systems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings. 

Our Studio Entertainment segment primarily generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment and TV/SVOD markets, stage play ticket sales and licensing of our intellectual properties for use in live entertainment productions. Significant expenses include amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, marketing and sales costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales. 

Our Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segment primarily generates revenue from subscription fees for our DTC streaming services, affiliate fees and advertising sales (including addressable ad sales). Significant expenses include operating expenses, selling general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses include programming and production costs (including programming, production and branded digital content obtained from other Company segments), technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. 

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. Total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by GAAP, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. 

The following table reconciles income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes to total segment operating income:

Revenues 

The increase in affiliate fees was due to increases of 8% from higher contractual rates, 6% from the consolidation of TFCF and 2% from the benefit of an additional week in the current year, partially offset by a decrease of 4% from fewer subscribers. The subscriber decline was net of a benefit from the ACC Network which launched in August 2019. 

The decline in advertising revenues was due to decreases of $392 million at Cable Networks, from $3,503 million to $3,111 million and $199 million at Broadcasting, from $3,462 million to $3,263 million. Cable Networks advertising revenue reflected a decrease of 22% from lower impressions reflecting lower average viewership due to the impact COVID-19 had on live sports events. This decrease was partially offset by increases of 7% from the consolidation of TFCF, 4% from the benefit of an additional week of operations, which included MLB and NBA events, and 2% from higher rates. Broadcasting advertising revenue reflected decreases of 9% from lower network impressions reflecting lower average viewership and 3% from the owned television stations. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 3% from higher network rates, 2% from the benefit of an additional week of operations and 2% from the consolidation of TFCF. 

The increase in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue of $2,572 million was due to the consolidation of TFCF, which consisted primarily of program sales, and higher program sales at Disney Television Studios, Disney Channel and FX. The increase in Disney Television Studios was primarily due to sales of original titles to Hulu and library titles to Hulu and 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

Disney+. The increases at Disney Channel and FX were due to program sales to Disney+ and Hulu, respectively. These increases were partially offset by lower sales to third parties. 

Costs and Expenses 

Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $1,857 million from $14,697 million to $16,554 million. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $435 million due to the consolidation of TFCF, contractual increases for college football, NFL and NBA programming, higher program sales and costs for the ACC Network. These increases were partially offset by the deferral of costs for NBA, MLB and college football to fiscal 2021 when these events occurred or are scheduled to occur. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $1,422 million due to the consolidation of TFCF and higher program sales at Disney Television Studios, partially offset by lower costs driven by production shutdowns and delays as a result of COVID-19. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $153 million from $2,361 million to $2,514 million due to the consolidation of TFCF, partially offset by lower marketing costs at the ABC Television Network, FX Networks and ESPN due to the impact of COVID-19. 

Equity in the Income of Investees 

Income from equity investees increased $34 million, from $703 million to $737 million, driven by higher income from A+E Television Networks due to lower programming costs and higher program sales, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. 

Segment Operating Income 

Segment operating income increased 21%, or $1,543 million, to $9,022 million due to the consolidation of TFCF and increases at ESPN, the FX Networks, Disney Television Studios and the ABC Television Network.

Revenues 

The decrease in theme park admissions revenue was due to a decrease of 49% from lower attendance, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher average ticket prices. Our parks were closed for a significant portion of the fiscal year due to COVID-19, and those that reopened were operating at significantly reduced capacity. 

Parks &#38; Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue was lower compared to the prior year due to a decrease of 48% from lower volumes, partially offset by an increase of 4% from higher average guest spending. 

The decrease in resorts and vacations revenue was due to decreases of 22% from lower occupied room nights and 15% from fewer passenger cruise days driven by the suspension of cruise ship sailings. 

Merchandise licensing and retail revenue was lower due to decreases of 4% from retail and 3% from merchandise licensing. The decrease in revenues at retail was driven by the closure of our retail stores for a significant portion of the fiscal year as a result of COVID-19 and the prior-year sale of rights to a video game, partially offset by higher online sales. The decrease at merchandise licensing was primarily due to lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition and a decrease in sales of merchandise based on Toy Story, Avengers and Disney Classics, partially offset by higher sales of Frozen merchandise. Merchandise licensing revenues for the current year were adversely impacted by COVID-19. 

The decrease in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to lower sponsorship revenue and a decrease in royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort, which was closed or operating at reduced capacity for a significant portion of the fiscal year.

Costs and Expenses 

Operating expenses include operating labor, which decreased $1,304 million from $6,174 million to $4,870 million, cost of sales and distribution costs, which decreased $716 million from $2,918 million to $2,202 million, and infrastructure costs, which decreased $47 million from $2,469 million to $2,422 million. The decrease in operating labor was due to furloughs in response to lower volumes and the benefit of government credits for certain employee costs, partially offset by inflation and new guest offerings. Lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to lower volumes. The decrease in infrastructure costs was due to lower operations support costs reflecting reduced volumes, partially offset by the write-down of assets at our retail stores and higher costs for new guest offerings. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions/fees and entertainment offerings, decreased $463 million, from $2,454 million to $1,991 million, due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher charges for capital project abandonments. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $491 million from $3,133 million to $2,642 million due to marketing and general and administrative cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. 

Depreciation and amortization increased $131 million from $2,306 million to $2,437 million, primarily due to new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. 

Segment Operating Income 

Segment operating income decreased $6,839 million, to a loss of $81 million due to decreases at our domestic and international parks and experiences and, to a lesser extent, our retail and merchandise licensing businesses.

Revenues 

The decrease in theatrical distribution revenue was due to fewer significant releases, which included the impact of theater closures as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF. Significant titles in the current year included Frozen II , Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil . Significant titles in the prior year included Avengers: Endgame , The Lion King , Captain Marvel , Toy Story 4 , Aladdin , Ralph Breaks the Internet , Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo . 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

Lower home entertainment revenue was due to decreases of 21% from lower unit sales of both new releases and catalog titles and 4% from lower average net effective pricing, partially offset by an increase of 14% from the consolidation of TFCF. New release titles in the current year included Frozen II, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker , The Lion King and Toy Story 4 , whereas the prior year included Avengers: Endgame , Incredibles 2 , Captain Marvel , Ant-Man And The Wasp , Ralph Breaks The Internet , Avengers: Infinity War , Bohemian Rhapsody and Aladdin . The decrease in average net effective pricing was primarily due to a lower mix of new release titles. 

Higher TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to increases of 21% from TV/SVOD distribution and 14% from the consolidation of TFCF, partially offset by a decrease of 8% from stage plays reflecting the impact of theater closures in response to COVID-19. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution was due to sales of content to Disney+, partially offset by lower sales to third parties in the pay and free television windows. 

Costs and Expenses 

Operating expenses include amortization of production, participation and residual costs, which decreased $119 million, from $3,762 million to $3,643 million, primarily due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment revenue, partially offset by higher TV/SVOD distribution revenue and the consolidation of TFCF. Operating expenses also include cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which decreased $449 million, from $1,425 million to $976 million. Lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs were primarily due to decreases in theatrical and stage play distribution costs due to fewer theatrical releases and stage play performances, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF. 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $750 million from $3,119 million to $2,369 million due to lower theatrical and home entertainment marketing costs, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the consolidation of TFCF. 

Segment Operating Income 

Segment operating income decreased 7%, or $185 million to $2,501 million due to lower theatrical and stage play results, partially offset by an increase in TV/SVOD distribution results.

Revenues 

The increase in subscription fees was due to the launch of Disney+ starting in November 2019, the consolidation of Hulu, subscriber growth at Hulu, and to a lesser extent, increased subscribers at ESPN+. 

The increase in affiliate fees was due to an increase of 44% from the consolidation of TFCF, partially offset by decreases of 9% from fewer subscribers driven by the expiration of certain carriage agreements and channel closures, both primarily in Europe, and 3% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 

The increase in advertising revenues was due to an increase of 30% from higher addressable advertising sales, partially offset by a decrease of 4% from our International Channels. Higher addressable advertising sales were due to the consolidation of Hulu and, to a lesser extent, TFCF and higher impressions, partially offset by lower rates. The increase in impressions was due to growth at Hulu, partially offset by the timing of cricket programming and the impact of lower impressions at our other digital platforms. The decrease in rates was primarily due to lower rates at Hulu. The decrease in advertising revenues at our International Channels was driven by lower impressions, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF. The decrease in impressions reflected the impact of COVID-19, including a shift in the timing of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches to fiscal 2021, and the comparison to the prior-year broadcast of International Cricket Council World Cup (ICC WC) matches. The ICC WC is held every four years. 

Growth in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to higher Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view fees, the consolidation of TFCF and, to a lesser extent, Hulu and Disney+ Premier Access revenues from Mulan. These increases were partially offset by the comparison to the sub-licensing of ICC WC rights to third-party broadcasters in the prior year and lower revenue from streaming technology services.

(1) A subscriber for which we recognized subscription revenue. A subscriber ceases to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. A subscription bundle is considered a paid subscriber for each service included in the bundle. Subscribers include those who receive the service through wholesale arrangements in which we receive a fee for the distribution of Disney+ to each subscriber to an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC services, whether acquired individually, through a wholesale arrangement or via the bundle, we refer to them as paid subscriptions. 

(2) Revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based upon the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period beginning at launch and ending on the last day of the period. The average revenue per subscriber is net of discounts provided to both wholesale and bundled subscribers, annual subscriptions and other limited term promotional offers. The bundled discount is allocated to each service based on the relative retail price of each service on a standalone basis. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third party platforms like Apple. 

(3) Disney+ Hotstar launched on April 3, 2020 in India (as a conversion of the preexisting Hotstar service) and on September 5, 2020 in Indonesia, and is included in the number of paid subscribers and average monthly revenue per paid subscriber. The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for Disney+ Hotstar in India and Indonesia is significantly lower than the average monthly revenue per paid subscriber in North America and Europe. 

(4) Excludes Disney+ Premier Access revenue. 

(5) Excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. 

(6) Hulu&#8217;s average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the period September 30, 2018 to March 19, 2019 is not reflected in the Company&#8217;s prior-year revenues, but is included in the average monthly revenue per paid subscriber reported in the table. Includes advertising revenue (including amounts generated during free trial subscription periods). 

The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for ESPN+ decreased from $5.12 to $4.35 due to the introduction of a bundled subscription package offering of Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu beginning in November 2019 and lower per-subscriber advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in retail pricing in August 2020. The bundled offering has a lower retail price than the aggregate standalone retail prices of the individual services. 

The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu SVOD Only service decreased from $13.09 to $12.24 driven by a decrease in retail pricing, lower per-subscriber advertising revenue and the introduction of the bundled offering, partially offset by a lower mix of promotional and wholesale subscribers. The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu Live TV + SVOD service increased from $55.98 to $67.24 due to an increase in retail pricing in December 2019 and higher per-subscriber Live TV advertising and premium add-on revenue, partially offset by the introduction of the bundled offering. 

Costs and Expenses 

Operating expenses include a $5,381 million increase in programming and production costs, from $6,925 million to $12,306 million, and a $1,151 million increase in other operating expenses, from $1,615 million to $2,766 million. Programming and production costs include the costs of content provided by other segments. The increase in programming and production costs was due to the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF, the launch of Disney+ and higher costs at Hulu, partially offset by lower costs for sports programming. The increase in costs at Hulu was driven by higher subscriber-based fees for programming on the Live TV service. Lower costs for sports programming were primarily due to the comparison to the ICC WC in the prior year and the shift in the timing of IPL, partially offset by higher costs for UFC programming rights. Other operating expenses, which include technical support and distribution costs, increased due to the launch of Disney+ and the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF. 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $2,085 million, from $2,116 million to $4,201 million, due to the launch of Disney+ and the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF. 

Depreciation and amortization increased $135 million, from $325 million to $460 million, due to the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF and the launch of Disney+. 

Equity in the Loss of Investees 

Loss from equity investees in the prior year of $240 million improved by $200 million to a loss of $40 million, due to the consolidation of Hulu. In the current year, Hulu&#8217;s results are reported in revenues and expenses. In the prior year, prior to March 20, 2019, the Company recognized its ownership share of Hulu&#8217;s results in equity in the loss of investees. 

Segment Operating Loss 

Segment operating loss increased from $1,835 million to $2,806 million, due to costs associated with the launch of Disney+, the consolidation of Hulu and a decrease at our International Channels. These decreases were partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF and improved results at ESPN+ and Hulu.

Revenues 

The increase in revenue eliminations was due to sales of Media Networks content to Hulu and Disney+ and sales of Studio Entertainment content to Disney+. The increase in Media Networks sales to Hulu was due to higher sales of original titles, driven by Little Fires Everywhere and Mrs. America, and library titles. Higher Media Networks sales also included an increase in affiliate fees received from Hulu for networks in the Hulu Live TV + SVOD service. Media Networks sales to Disney+ were due to sales of library series, including The Simpsons and Disney Channel titles, and original series. Studio Entertainment content sold to Disney+ included original titles Noelle , Lady and the Tramp , and Artemis Fowl and theatrically released titles Frozen II, The Lion King , Toy Story 4 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker . 

Operating Income 

The increase in the impact from eliminations was due to sales of Media Networks content to Hulu and Disney+ and sales of Studio Entertainment content to Disney+. 

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES 

Corporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows: 

##TABLE_START (in millions) 2020 2019 % Change Better (Worse) Corporate and unallocated shared expenses $ (817) $ (987) 17% ##TABLE_END

The decrease in corporate and unallocated shared expenses was due to lower costs related to TFCF and lower compensation costs, partially offset by the absence of a benefit from amortization of a deferred gain on a sale leaseback due to the adoption of new lease accounting guidance. The decrease in costs related to TFCF was due to lower acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF. 

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES 

See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company&#8217;s restructuring activities in connection with the acquisition of TFCF and from a workforce reduction plan, primarily at the Parks, Experiences and Products segment.

Operating Activities 

Continuing operations 

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 increased 27% or $1.6 billion to $7.6 billion, due to lower tax payments, driven by the payment of approximately $7.6 billion of tax obligations that arose from the spin-off of Fox Corporation in connection with the TFCF acquisition and the sale of the RSNs acquired with TFCF in the prior year, and higher current year operating cash flow at Media Networks. These increases were partially offset by lower operating cash flow at Parks, Experiences and Products and Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International. The increase at Media Networks was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue. Lower operating cash flows at Parks, Experiences and Products were due to lower cash receipts driven by decreased revenues, partially offset by lower cash disbursements. Lower cash disbursements were due to lower operating expenses. The decrease at Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International was due to higher film and television spending and an increase in operating cash disbursements due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts driven by revenues from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu and the launch of Disney+.

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

Produced and licensed content costs 

The Company&#8217;s Studio Entertainment, Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segments incur costs to license and produce film and television programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company&#8217;s broadcast and cable networks, television stations and DTC services. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability. 

The Company&#8217;s film and television production and programming activity for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 

##TABLE_START (in millions) 2020 2019 Beginning balances: Production and programming assets $ 27,407 &#160; &#160; $ 9,202 &#160; Programming liabilities (4,061) &#160; (1,178) &#160; 23,346 &#160; &#160; 8,024 &#160; Spending: Television program licenses and rights 12,077 &#160; &#160; 10,517 &#160; Film and television production 8,104 &#160; &#160; 7,104 &#160; 20,181 &#160; &#160; 17,621 &#160; Amortization: Television program licenses and rights (11,241) &#160; (10,608) &#160; Film and television production (9,337) &#160; (6,471) &#160; (20,578) &#160; (17,079) &#160;

Investing Activities 

Continuing operations 

Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company&#8217;s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 

##TABLE_START (in millions) 2020 2019 Media Networks Cable Networks $ 61 &#160; &#160; $ 93 &#160; Broadcasting 51 &#160; &#160; 81 &#160; Parks, Experiences and Products Domestic 2,145 &#160; &#160; 3,294 &#160; International 759 &#160; &#160; 852 &#160; Studio Entertainment 77 &#160; &#160; 88 &#160; Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International 594 &#160; &#160; 258 &#160; Corporate 335 &#160; &#160; 210 &#160; $ 4,022 &#160; &#160; $ 4,876 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. 

Capital expenditures for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The decrease in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower spend on Star Wars : Galaxy&#8217;s Edge at both the Walt Disney World and Disneyland resorts. Capital spending in fiscal 2020 also reflected the suspension of certain capital projects as a result of COVID-19. 

Capital expenditures at Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International primarily reflect investments in technology. The increase in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to spending on technology to support our streaming services. 

Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The increase in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to higher spending on facilities. 

The Company currently expects its fiscal 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.6 billion higher than fiscal 2020 capital expenditures of $4.0 billion due to increased spending on facilities at Corporate and spending on technology at Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International, partially offset by lower investments at our domestic parks and resorts, in part reflecting a reduction in spending in response to COVID-19. 

Other Investing Activities 

The fiscal 2019 spending of $9.9 billion on acquisitions reflects $35.7 billion of cash paid to acquire TFCF less $25.7 billion of cash acquired in the transaction (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash provided by other investing activities of $172 million in fiscal 2020 reflects the proceeds from the sale of an investment while cash used in other investing activities of $319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of $347 million to Hulu prior to the consolidation of Hulu. 

Discontinued operations 

Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the RSNs. 

Financing Activities 

Continuing operations 

Cash provided by financing activities was $8.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to cash used in financing activities of $0.5 billion in fiscal 2019. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to borrowings, partially offset by dividend payments and settlement of acquisition related obligations. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was from higher cash proceeds from net borrowings ($11.2 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019). 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

Discontinued operations 

Cash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the RSNs. 

Borrowings activities and other 

During the year ended October 3, 2020, the Company&#8217;s borrowing activity was as follows:

(1) Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net. 

(2) The other activity is primarily due to the amortization of purchase price adjustments on debt assumed in the TFCF acquisition and debt issuance fees. 

(3) The other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. 

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company&#8217;s bank facilities. The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities maturing in March 2021, March 2023 and March 2025, unused availability under the $5.0 billion bank facility maturing in April 2021, incremental term debt issuances and operating cash flows, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. 

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company&#8217;s dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in fiscal 2020 or 2019. 

The Company&#8217;s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control, including COVID-19, which has affected our segment operations in a number of ways, and as a result, had an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s operating cash flows. We have taken a number of measures to mitigate the impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position. We have significantly increased the Company&#8217;s cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in March and May 2020. In addition, we entered into an additional $5.0 billion credit facility in April 2020, bringing the total capacity of our bank facilities to $17.25 billion. See Significant Developments for the impact COVID-19 had on our operations and mitigating measures. 

Despite the impact of COVID-19, we believe that the Company&#8217;s financial condition remains strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects, although certain of these activities have been scaled back or suspended in light of COVID-19. In addition to measures the Company has already taken in response to COVID-19, there are a number of additional mitigating actions the Company may take in the future such as not declaring dividends (which the Board of Directors did not declare with respect to fiscal 2020 operations); reducing, or not making certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; raising additional financing; further suspending capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force. 

The Company&#8217;s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company&#8217;s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of October 3, 2020, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, Standard and Poor&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2, respectively, and Fitch&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2, respectively. In addition, Fitch has placed the Company&#8217;s long-term debt rating on Negative Outlook. On November 18, 2020, Standard and Poor&#8217;s lowered the Company&#8217;s long-term rating to BBB+ and placed the Company&#8217;s long-term ratings on Negative Outlook. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 3, 2020, by a significant margin. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default. 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

The duration of business closures and other impacts related to COVID-19, and the corresponding duration of the impacts to our operating cash flows, are subject to substantial uncertainty. These impacts to our operating cash flows may require us to rely more heavily on external funding sources, such as debt and other types of financing. 

SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

On March 20, 2019, as part of the acquisition of TFCF, The Walt Disney Company (&#8220;TWDC&#8221;) became the ultimate parent of TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (&#8220;Legacy Disney&#8221;). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as &#8220;Obligor Group&#8221;, and individually, as a &#8220;Guarantor&#8221;. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF&#8217;s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the &#8220;exchange notes&#8221;) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the &#8220;TWDC Indenture&#8221;) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the &#8220;2001 Trustee&#8221;) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee). 

Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the &#8220;non-Guarantors&#8221;). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at October 3, 2020 was as follows: 

##TABLE_START TWDC Legacy Disney (in millions) Par Value Carrying Value Par Value Carrying Value Registered debt with unconditional guarantee $ 38,646 &#160; $ 41,077 &#160; $ 12,541 &#160; $ 12,751 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor&#8217;s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney&#8217;s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities. 

Operations are conducted almost entirely through the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group&#8217;s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group. 

Set forth below are summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, &#8220;Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities&#8221; and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs 

At the beginning of fiscal 2020, the Company adopted on a prospective basis, new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance that updates the accounting for film and television content costs. Under that new guidance, we amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period&#8217;s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). 

With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film&#8217;s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company&#8217;s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows, including intersegment content transactions, and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. 

With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees&#8217; platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program&#8217;s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons. 

Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed. 

Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense. 

The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue (relative value). If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season&#8217;s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies. 

Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions 

The Company&#8217;s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. 

The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We reduced our discount rate to 2.82% at the end of fiscal 2020 from 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2020 year-end measurement date. The Company&#8217;s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans&#8217; liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2021 by approximately $351 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 3, 2020 by approximately $4.0 billion. A one

percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $303 million and $3.4 billion, respectively. 

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2021 annual expense by approximately $164 million. 

Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments 

The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. 

Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. 

The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. 

The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 

In fiscal 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment. 

The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company&#8217;s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. 

To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. 

The qualitative assessment requires consideration of recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows. 

The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. 

The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company&#8217;s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset&#8217;s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. 

TABL E OF CONTENTS 

The Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. 

The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.2 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels&#8217; business as discussed below under &#8220;Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and Estimates.&#8221; 

The fiscal 2019 charges primarily related to impairments of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting recorded in &#8220;Equity in the income (loss) of investees&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. 

Contingencies and Litigation 

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. 

Income Tax 

As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company&#8217;s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company&#8217;s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. 

Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and Estimates 

In light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies. As COVID-19 continues to develop, we may make changes to these estimates and judgments over time, which could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods. A more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Accounting Policies and Estimates follows. 

Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs 

Certain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed or canceled. The duration of the delay, market conditions when we release the content, or a change in our release strategy (e.g. bypassing certain distribution windows) could have an impact on Ultimate Revenues, which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs. 

Given the ongoing uncertainty around the resumption and continuation of live sporting events, the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events. Such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs.

Revenue Recognition 

Certain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks (e.g. live sports or original content). If there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities, we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts. 

Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments 

Given the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 across our businesses, the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal. If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to impair some of these assets. 

Our International Channels reporting unit, which is part of the Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segment, comprises the Company&#8217;s international television networks. Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks. A majority of the operations in this reporting unit were acquired in the TFCF acquisition and therefore the fair value of these businesses approximated the carrying value at the date of the acquisition of TFCF. 

The International Channels business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in decreased viewership and lower advertising revenue related to the availability of content, including the deferral or cancellation of certain live sporting events. The Company&#8217;s increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to use on our DTC services because the International Channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift, which is reflected in other reporting units. In addition, the industry shift to DTC, including by us and many of our distributors, who are pursuing their own DTC strategies, has changed the competitive dynamics for the International Channels business and resulted in unfavorable affiliation renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements. 

In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we assessed the International Channels&#8217; long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of $1.9 billion primarily related to MVPD agreement intangible assets and $3.1 billion related to goodwill. 

See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 

Risk Management Contracts 

The Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. 

Changes to our hedged cash flows from a decrease in projected revenues of the Company or reductions of projected usage of commodities as compared to our projections when we entered into hedges may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in our income statement prior to when the hedged transaction was projected to occur. 

New Accounting Pronouncements
