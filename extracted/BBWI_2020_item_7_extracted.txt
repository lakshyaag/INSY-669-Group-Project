 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Our operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance. 

Executive Overview 

Beginning in 2018, we began making significant changes in our business to focus resources on core categories to enhance performance and accelerate growth. In 2018, these actions included:

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Reducing our regular dividend. 

##TABLE_END Further, on February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value, and we believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath &#38; Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity. 

We have a multi-year goal to grow Bath &#38; Body Works and increase operating margins by focusing on these key business priorities: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Grow our business in North America; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Extend our brand internationally; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Focus on the fundamentals of our business. 

##TABLE_END We also continue to focus on: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Attracting and retaining top talent; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Returning value to our shareholders. 

##TABLE_END The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities: 

Grow our business in North America 

The core assortment of Bath &#38; Body Works is body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers, which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We will continue to invest in the White Barn concept, which continues to yield strong results. In 2020 , we plan to increase our square footage at Bath &#38; Body Works North America through the opening of new Bath &#38; Body Works stores, substantially in off-mall locations, and the remodeling of existing stores. 

Our Bath &#38; Body Works direct business, with over $950 million in sales and an operating margin in excess of 20%, grew sales by 32% over last year. We continue to invest in direct channel fulfillment to further accelerate growth. 

Extend our brand internationally 

We believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have a separate, dedicated team that has taken a methodical, "test and learn" approach to expansion. We plan to expand our presence outside of North America by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners. Our partners opened 43 net new Bath &#38; Body Works stores in 2019 , bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to 278 stores. Our partners plan to open additional stores in 2020 . 

Focus on the fundamentals of our business 

We are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates. 

2019 Overview 

L Brands' overall financial performance in 2019 was below our expectations. Operating income declined as growth at Bath &#38; Body Works was more than offset by declines at Victoria&#8217;s Secret. Our net sales decreased $323 million to $12.914 billion primarily driven by Victoria's Secret and the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our operating income decreased $979 million to $258 million , primarily due to Victoria's Secret underperformance, and goodwill and long-lived store asset impairment charges. Our operating income rate decreased to 2.0% from 9.3% . 

At Bath &#38; Body Works, an aligned, experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments, driven by a close connection to our customer and a fast and agile supply chain, resulted in another record year, on top of a record 2018. In 2019, Bath &#38; Body Works&#8217; comparable sales increased 10% and operating income increased 11%. Sales in the digital 

channel increased 32%. We ended the year with more than 800 newly remodeled stores, which include the White Barn store design. These stores present a new, compelling store experience for the brand and customers alike, driving sales growth. 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret underperformed in 2019. Reduced traffic resulted in increased promotion that negatively impacted margin rates. Victoria&#8217;s Secret segment comparable sales declined 7% for the year, and operating income declined to a loss of $616 million, due to a $690 million goodwill impairment charge and sales and margin underperformance. 

In Victoria&#8217;s Secret Lingerie, comparable sales declined in the high-single digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to pull back on promotional activity in bras, and while sales were down significantly, the merchandise margin rate was up. Sleepwear performance was below our expectations, with sales and merchandise margin rate down significantly to last year. 

PINK comparable sales declined in the low-double digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly. Growth in bras and panties was more than offset by a decline in apparel, particularly in tops. 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret Beauty had a good year and a solid holiday performance, with positive low-single digit comparable sales and an improvement in the merchandise margin rate. 

Outside North America, we opened 59 net new stores in 2019, ending the year with 812 stores. Revenue in our international segment was about flat in 2019 compared to last year, and the operating loss increased by $199 million, primarily driven by store asset and goodwill impairment charges in Greater China. 

For additional information related to our 2019 financial performance, see &#8220;Results of Operations &#8211; 2019 Compared to 2018 .&#8221; 

We are committed to returning value to our shareholders. During 2019 , we paid $332 million in dividends. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. Since 2000, we have returned approximately $21 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 

Adjusted Financial Information 

In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income and earnings per share in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share amounts)

##TABLE_END 2020 Outlook 

On February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria&#8217;s Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by our Board of Directors, with input from outside financial advisors, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath &#38; Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity. 

Additionally, we believe that a private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria&#8217;s Secret turnaround. We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a new perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that, by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand. 

Over the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the standalone Bath &#38; Body Works business, with a view to simplify our existing structure, while recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria&#8217;s Secret businesses through a Transition Services Agreement with various terms for different services, which will minimize near-term dissynergies. 

The management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the standalone Bath &#38; Body Works business. 

Upon the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Leslie H. Wexner will step down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board. Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of Bath &#38; Body Works, will be appointed by the Board as the Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, Inc. and as a director of L Brands, Inc., effective upon the Closing. Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board effective upon the Closing. 

The global retail sector and our business continue to face an uncertain environment and, as a result, we will continue to manage our business thoughtfully, and we will focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals. 

At the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments, marketing and store and online experiences to our customers. We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us. 

We are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. The coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a &#8220;pandemic,&#8221; has spread to many countries, including the U.S., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Related industries in the U.S. and across the 

world may be adversely affected, including manufacturing and textile production. The situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending, labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the U.S., China and other countries. To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. Further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition. The coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash. Any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition. 

These recent developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additional information on this risk and other uncertainties and factors, is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

&#160;________________ 

##TABLE_START (a) 

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. 

##TABLE_END The results by segment are as follows: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For 2019 , net sales decreased $570 million to $6.805 billion ; comparable sales decreased 7% ; and comparable store sales decreased 9% . Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the high-single digit range, primarily due to declines in bras and apparel, driven by merchandise performance. PINK comparable sales were down in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance and the exit of the swim business. Victoria&#8217;s Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range, as growth in accessories and PINK beauty were partially offset by a decline in the lip business. 

The decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For 2019 , net sales increased $539 million to $5.170 billion ; comparable sales increased 10% ; and comparable store sales increased 5% . Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. 

The increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For 2019 , net sales decreased $5 million to $600 million due to declines in the Victoria's Secret Travel Retail business and the negative impact of foreign currency in Greater China, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China. 

Other 

For 2019 , net sales decreased $287 million to $339 million primarily due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Gross Profit 

For 2019 , our gross profit decreased $449 million to $4.450 billion , and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 34.5% from 37.0% primarily as a result of: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For 2019 , the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, partially offset by a reduction in long-lived store asset impairment charges, from $70 million in 2018 to $51 million in 2019. 

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For 2019 , the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales , partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate. 

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For 2019 , the gross profit decrease was primarily due to the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges, related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, from $31 million in 2018 to $212 million in 2019. 

The gross profit (loss) rate decrease was driven by the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges. 

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 

For 2019 , our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $91 million to $3.472 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath &#38; Body Works. 

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate remained flat at 26.9% as the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and declines in marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret were offset by deleverage on lower net sales. 

Impairment of Goodwill 

In 2019, our goodwill impairment assessments concluded that the carrying values of our Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $690 million and $30 million in the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International segments, respectively. 

Loss on Divestiture of La Senza 

In 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the loss related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.

##TABLE_END

For 2019 , our interest expense decreased $7 million to $378 million due to a lower average daily borrowings. 

Other Income (Loss) 

For 2019 , our other income (loss) decreased $ 66 million to a $61 million loss due to a $40 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of $764 million in outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022 and $37 million of charges to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

For 2019 , our effective tax rate was (101.9%) compared to 24.9% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.

&#160;________________ 

##TABLE_START (a) 

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. 

##TABLE_END

The results by segment are as follows: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , net sales decreased $256 million to $2.276 billion ; comparable sales decreased 10% ; and comparable store sales decreased 10% . Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the mid-teens as we continued to pull back promotional activity in bras, and due to merchandise performance in sleepwear. PINK comparable sales were down in the mid-teens driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance. PINK lingerie sales were about flat to last year. Victoria&#8217;s Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range due to growth in prestige fragrance, driven by a strong launch of Bombshell Intense, and in PINK beauty and accessories. 

The decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , net sales increased $224 million to $2.175 billion ; comparable sales increased 10% ; and comparable store sales increased 5% . Net sales increased in all of our main categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. 

The increase in comparable sales was driven by increases in store conversion and digital traffic. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , net sales decreased $13 million to $177 million , due to declines in the Victoria's Secret U.K. business, partially offset by the increase from new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in Greater China. 

Other 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , net sales decreased $100 million to $79 million due to the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Gross Profit 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , our gross profit decreased $174 million to $1.794 billion , and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 38.1% from 40.6% primarily as a result of: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , the gross profit decrease was driven primarily by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales. 

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales , partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate. 

The gross profit rate decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , the gross profit decrease was primarily due to $35 million in long-lived store asset impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was related to the operating lease asset of a store in Greater China. 

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by the long-lived store asset impairment charges. 

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased $ 47 million to $1.022 billion due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath &#38; Body Works. 

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 21.7% from 22.0% driven by the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses. 

Impairment of Goodwill 

In the fourth quarter of 2019, our annual goodwill impairment assessment concluded that the carrying value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recognized a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the Victoria's Secret segment. 

Loss on Divestiture of La Senza 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.

##TABLE_END

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , our interest expense decreased $1 million to $92 million due to lower average daily borrowings partially offset by a higher average borrowing rate. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

For the fourth quarter of 2019 , our effective tax rate declined compared to 24.0% in 2018. The 2019 rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charge, which generated minimal tax benefit. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. 

Results of Operations&#8212;2018 Compared to 2017

##TABLE_END The results by segment are as follows: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For 2018, net sales decreased $12 million to $7.375 billion; comparable sales decreased 2%; and comparable store sales decreased 6%. PINK comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digit range, primarily driven by merchandise performance in apparel and the exit of swim. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales decreased in the low-single digit range, primarily driven by declines in unconstructed and sport bras, due to merchandise performance and category resets, partially offset by increases in sleep and panties. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased low-double digits, driven by the merchandise assortment. Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement. 

The decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For 2018, net sales increased $483 million to $4.631 billion; comparable sales increased 11%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. 

The increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For 2018, net sales increased $103 million to $605 million due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. 

Other 

For 2018, net sales increased $31 million to $626 million primarily due to an increase in wholesale sales to our international partners, partially offset by a decline in La Senza as we divested this business on January 6, 2019. 

Gross Profit 

For 2018, our gross profit decreased $60 million to $4.899 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 37.0% from 39.3% primarily as a result of: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For 2018, the gross profit decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, increased promotional activity to drive traffic and clear inventory, $70 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain stores in the U.S. and Canada and increased distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales. 

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the long-lived store asset impairment charges. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and reduced promotional activity, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate. 

The gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For 2018, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by $31 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain Victoria's Secret stores in the U.K. and higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater 

China, partially offset by increased merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. 

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by the long-lived store asset impairment charges and investments in store real estate. 

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 

For 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $332 million to $3.563 billion driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments, higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath &#38; Body Works and new company-owned stores in Greater China. 

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 26.9% from 25.6% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments. 

Loss on Divestiture of La Senza 

In 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.

##TABLE_END

For 2018, our interest expense decreased $21 million to $385 million due to a lower average borrowing rate partially offset by higher average daily borrowings. 

Other Income (Loss) 

For 2018, our other income (loss) increased $15 million to $5 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in 2017, partially offset by fewer distributions received from our Easton investments and the negative impacts of foreign exchange. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

For 2018, our effective tax rate decreased to 24.9% from 25.1%. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.

##TABLE_END

&#160;________________ 

##TABLE_START (a) 

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline). A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 14-to-14-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada. 

##TABLE_END The results by segment are as follows: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales decreased $137 million to $2.532 billion; comparable sales decreased 3%; and comparable store sales decreased 7%. PINK comparable sales decreased in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by merchandise performance in apparel. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were about flat, primarily driven by declines in intimate apparel, due to merchandise performance and category resets, offset by an increase in sleep. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the mid-single digit range, driven by the merchandise assortment. Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement. 

The decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $157 million to $1.951 billion; comparable sales increased 12%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. 

The increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $20 million to $190 million, due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. These increases were partially offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret U.K. 

Other 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales decreased $11 million to $179 million due to declines in La Senza and Henri Bendel as we divested La Senza and closed Henri Bendel in the quarter. 

Gross Profit 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our gross profit decreased $72 million to $1.968 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 40.6% from 42.3% primarily as a result of: 

Victoria&#8217;s Secret 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, increased promotional activity to drive traffic and clear inventory and due to $20 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain stores in the U.S. 

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the long-lived store asset impairment charges. 

Bath &#38; Body Works 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and reduced promotional activity, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate. 

The gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity. 

Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. 

The gross profit rate increase was driven by buying and occupancy leverage on higher net sales. 

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $16 million to $1.069 billion primarily driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments and higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath &#38; Body Works, partially offset by lower selling expenses and fashion show costs at Victoria's Secret. 

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 22.0% from 21.8% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments. 

Loss on Divestiture of La Senza 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.

##TABLE_END

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our interest expense decreased $13 million to $93 million due to a lower average borrowing rate and lower average daily borrowings. 

Other Income (Loss) 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our other income (loss) increased $42 million to $4 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our effective tax rate increased to 24.0% from 21.1%. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income (loss) and working capital changes. Our net income (loss) is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $265 million as of February 1, 2020 . 

On February 20, 2020, we and Sycamore entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands, Inc. shareholders by positioning Bath &#38; Body Works as a standalone public company and transitioning Victoria's Secret, including business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands and certain support functions, into a privately-held entity. 

After taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a 55% interest in Victoria&#8217;s Secret for approximately $525 million . We intend to use the proceeds from the transaction, along with approximately $500 million of excess balance sheet cash, to reduce debt. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. 

Company Response to Coronavirus 

Subsequent to February 1, 2020 , we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus. 

On March 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, we elected to borrow $950 million from our Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million . 

On March 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all Bath &#38; Body Works, Victoria&#8217;s Secret and PINK stores in the United States and Canada through March 29, 2020. Associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through April 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced. 

Based on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial March 29th date. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings. However, we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate. We continue to serve customers through our direct channels. 

In an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic, we are proactively taking the following additional actions: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Suspending our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Executing a substantial reduction in expenses and capital expenditures. This includes an ongoing reduction in forward inventory receipts. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Temporarily reducing base compensation by 20% for senior vice presidents and above. The cash compensation of Chairman and CEO Leslie H. Wexner and other members of the Board of Directors has been suspended. Additionally, we are deferring annual merit increases. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Furloughing most store associates and those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home, effective April 5, 2020 until further notice. All furloughed associates will continue to receive existing healthcare benefits. As circumstances change, we will make every effort to bring these associates back to work as soon as possible. Furloughed associates will also be able to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible. 

##TABLE_END As of March 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the $950 million borrowed under the Secured Revolving Facility on March 16, 2020. Our Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. If we were to violate a covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder. While we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders. We are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated EBITDA financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing Secured Revolving Facility. We believe that our current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides us with sufficient current liquidity. 

Working Capital and Capitalization 

We believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements. 

The following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of February 1, 2020 , February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018 :

We did not repurchase any shares during 2019 .

##TABLE_END

Issuance of Notes 

In June 2019, we issued $500 million of 7.50% notes due in June 2029 ("2029 Notes"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the &#8220;Guarantors&#8221;). The proceeds from the issuance were $486 million , which were net of discounts and issuance costs of $14 million . The discounts and issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date and are included within Long-term Debt on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Repurchases of Notes 

In June 2019, we completed the early settlement of tender offers to repurchase $212 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, $330 million of outstanding 2021 Notes and $96 million of outstanding 2022 Notes for $669 million . We used the proceeds from the 2029 Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the purchase price for the tender offers. Additionally, in July 2019, we redeemed the remaining $126 million of outstanding 2020 Notes for $130 million . 

In the second quarter of 2019, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $40 million (after-tax loss of $30 million ), which includes redemption fees and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). 

Exchange of Notes 

In June 2018, we completed private offers to exchange $62 million , $220 million and $44 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively, for $297 million of newly issued 6.694% notes due in January 2027 ("2027 Notes") and $52 million in cash consideration, which included a $24 million exchange premium. The exchange was treated as a modification under ASC 470, Debt , and no gain or loss was recognized. The exchange premium is being amortized through the maturity date of January 2027 and is included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2027 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors. 

Secured Revolving Facility 

We and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility. The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of $1 billion and allows us and certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds. 

In August 2019, we entered into an amendment and restatement (&#8220;Amendment&#8221;) of the Secured Revolving Facility. The Amendment maintained the aggregate availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $1 billion and extended the expiration date from May 2022 to August 2024. We incurred fees related to the Amendment of $5 million , which were capitalized and are recorded in Other Assets on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Secured Revolving Facility. 

The Secured Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are 0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are 1.75% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.75% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding foreign denominated borrowings is the applicable benchmark rate plus 1.75% per annum. 

The Secured Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00 and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00 for the most recent four-quarter period. Additionally, the Secured Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than 3.50 to 1.00 and (b) no default or event of default exists. As of February 1, 2020 , we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than 3.50 to 1.00 . 

During 2019 , we borrowed and repaid $12 million under the Secured Revolving Facility. As of February 1, 2020 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Facility. 

The Secured Revolving Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $19 million of outstanding letters of credit as of February 1, 2020 that reduced our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility. 

On March 16, 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus, we elected to borrow $950 million from the Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million. 

Secured Foreign Facilities 

We and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations ("Secured Foreign Facilities"). The Secured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $150 million . The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019 , we borrowed $117 million and made payments of $103 million under the Secured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $103 million . Borrowings on the Secured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and August 2024. As of February 1, 2020 , borrowings of $11 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining borrowings are included within Long-term Debt. 

Unsecured Foreign Facilities 

We guarantee unsecured revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations ("Unsecured Foreign Facilities"). The Unsecured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling $75 million . The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing. During 2019 , we borrowed $50 million and made payments of $59 million under the Unsecured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2019 was $74 million . Borrowings on the Unsecured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and April 2020. As of February 1, 2020 , borrowings of $50 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Credit Ratings 

Our borrowing costs under our Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities are linked to our credit ratings. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively. The guarantees of our obligations under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors&#8217; collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.

##TABLE_START (a) 

Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes and debentures. Interest payments have been estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations. Interest obligations exclude amounts which have been accrued through February 1, 2020 . For additional information, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) 

Future lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) 

Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) 

Other liabilities primarily include future payments relating to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan of $280 million in the "1-3 Years" category. The definitive agreement between us and Sycamore for the sale to Sycamore of the 55% interest in Victoria's Secret requires that we terminate our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan as of the Closing with respect to participants affected by the sale and for all other participants within six months. On March 11, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized management to take steps to terminate the plan as to all participants. The timing and specifics of such termination have not yet been determined. Any remaining benefits and obligations under the non-qualified plan are expected to be paid out in full approximately one year following the applicable termination. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) 

Other liabilities also include future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The &#8220;Less Than 1 Year&#8221; category includes $66 million of these tax items because it is reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements or resolution of uncertainties. The remaining portion totaling $24 million is included in the &#8220;Other&#8221; category as it is not reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months. In addition, we have a remaining liability of $41 million related to the deemed repatriation tax on our undistributed foreign earnings resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The tax liability will be paid over the next five years. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

##TABLE_END

La Senza 

In connection with the sale of La Senza in the fourth quarter of 2018, certain of our subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations of $40 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. As part of the sale, a liability of $5 million was recorded for these obligations. During 2019, an additional reserve of $35 million was recorded related to these obligations and certain other items. As of February 1, 2020 , reserves of $8 million are included within Accrued Expenses and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities. 

Other 

In connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is $94 million . We recorded a liability of $17 million and $11 million related to these guarantee obligations as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 , respectively. This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the February 1, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet, and in Other Long-term Liabilities on the February 2, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4). 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Leases 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASC 842, Leases , which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases. In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption. 

We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach. As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition. 

Upon adoption at the beginning of 2019, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $3.7 billion and operating lease assets for its leases of $3.3 billion . The operating lease assets are net of $470 million of liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of $2 million . The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows. 

Hedging Activities 

In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Goodwill 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with ASU 2017-04. 

Credit Losses 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Impact of Inflation 

While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position. 

Inventories 

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis. 

We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management&#8217;s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates. 

We also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management&#8217;s analysis of historical results and operating trends. 

Management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $4 million for 2019 . A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately $5 million for 2019 . 

Valuation of Long-lived Assets 

Long-lived Store Assets 

Long-lived store assets, which include leasehold improvements, store related assets and operating lease assets (subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases ), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group. For operating lease assets, we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. An individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value. The fair value of long-lived store assets are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. 

In 2019 and 2018, we concluded that the negative operating results for certain of our Victoria's Secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related store asset groups. We determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and, as a result, determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates. Accordingly, we recognized a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of an asset group and its estimated fair value but did not impair any individual store asset below its estimated fair value. 

In 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $198 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $151 million related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, and impairment charges of $47 million related to stores in the U.S. and Canada. For operating lease assets, we recognized impairment charges of $65 million. Impairment charges of $61 million related to stores in Greater China and the U.K., and impairment charges of $4 million related to stores in the U.S. 

In total, we recognized impairment charges of $263 million for long-lived store assets, which are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying &#38; Occupancy in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). Impairment charges of $212 million, related to store assets in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International segment. Impairment charges of $51 million, related to store assets in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment. 

In 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $101 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $70 million, related to stores in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment. Impairment charges of $31 million, related to stores in the U.K., were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International segment. These charges are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying &#38; Occupancy in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). 

Our fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates and market rental rates. The use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our store assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. A three percentage point reduction to our comparable sales assumptions, a key input in determining estimated future cash flows, would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019. Further sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period. 

When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. As a result of goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2019, only the Bath &#38; Body Works reporting unit has goodwill as of February 1, 2020. 

As of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of these reporting units and their impact on the sustained decline in our market capitalization. Further, for the Greater China reporting unit, we considered the results of the long-lived store asset impairment assessment. 

The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, which was based on a weighted average of the income and market approaches, exceeded its carrying value. However, the fair value of the Greater China reporting unit, which was based on the income approach, did not exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $30 million in the third quarter of 2019 related to the Greater China reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). 

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the Bath &#38; Body Works and Victoria's Secret reporting units. The fair value of the Bath &#38; Body Works reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of the income and market approaches. As a result of continued fourth quarter declines in business performance and increased risk, volatility and uncertainty related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, we estimated its fair value using a market approach. 

The annual assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). The annual assessment also concluded that the fair value of the Bath &#38; Body Works reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 

The market approach is based on earnings multiples of selected guideline public companies, while the income approach is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. The approaches, which are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, incorporated a number of significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, multiples of earnings of similar public companies, discount rates, income tax rates, terminal growth rates and an implied control premium relative to our market capitalization. 

The use of different assumptions or judgments in our goodwill impairment assessment, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the earnings multiples used in the market approach, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and the reasonableness of the implied control premium relative to our market capitalization, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our reporting units and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. Declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period. 

Intangible Assets - Indefinite Lives 

Intangible assets with indefinite lives represent the Victoria&#8217;s Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works trade names. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach, and compare that value with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference. 

As of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret trade name. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of Victoria's Secret. To estimate the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name exceeded its carrying value. 

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works trade names. To estimate the fair value of the trade names, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The annual assessment concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values. 

The use of different assumptions or judgments in our impairment assessment of our trade names, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and royalty rates used for the relief from royalty method, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our trade names. A 50% reduction to our assumed royalty rate would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019. 

Claims and Contingencies 

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management&#8217;s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. 

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings. 

We follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC 740, Income Taxes , which contains a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. 

Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. 

Revenue Recognition 

In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective approach. 

We recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer. We recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. Our shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers. 

We offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience. 

We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). 

Revenue earned in connection with Victoria&#8217;s Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in our 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). 

We also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.
