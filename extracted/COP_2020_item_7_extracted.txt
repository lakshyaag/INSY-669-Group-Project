&#160;

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE &#160;

OVERVIEW

&#160;

&#160;

ConocoPhillips is an independent E&#38;P company &#160;

with operations and activities in 15 countries. &#160;

Our diverse, 

low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich &#160;

unconventional plays in North America; &#160;

conventional 

assets in North America, Europe and Asia; &#160;

LNG developments; oil sands assets in Canada; &#160;

and an inventory of 

global conventional and unconventional exploration &#160;

prospects. &#160;

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at 

December 31, 2020, we employed approximately &#160;

9,700 people worldwide and had total &#160;

assets of $63 billion. 

&#160;

Completed Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. 

&#160;

On January 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition &#160;

of Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), an independent &#160;

oil 

and gas exploration and production company &#160;

with operations across New Mexico and West Texas. &#160;

The 

addition of complementary acreage in the &#160;

Delaware and Midland Basins creates a sizeable &#160;

Permian presence to 

augment our leading unconventional positions &#160;

in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48 &#160;

and the Montney 

in Canada. 

&#160;

Consideration for the all-stock transaction was &#160;

valued at $13.1 billion, in which 1.46 shares &#160;

of ConocoPhillips 

common stock was exchanged for each outstanding &#160;

share of Concho common stock, resulting &#160;

in the issuance 

of approximately 286 million shares of ConocoPhillips &#160;

common stock. &#160;

We also assumed $3.9 billion in 

aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt for &#160;

Concho, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7 &#160;

billion as 

of the closing date. &#160;

The combined companies are expected to &#160;

capture approximately $750 million of annual 

cost and capital savings by 2022. &#160;

For additional information &#160;

related to this transaction, see Note 25&#8212;

Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. in the &#160;

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

The energy landscape changed dramatically in 2020 with &#160;

simultaneous demand and supply shocks that drove 

the industry into a severe downturn. &#160;

The demand shock was triggered by the &#160;

COVID-19 pandemic, &#160;

which 

continues to have unprecedented social and economic &#160;

consequences. &#160;

Mitigation efforts to stop the spread of 

this highly-contagious disease include stay-at-home &#160;

orders and business closures that caused &#160;

sharp 

contractions in economic activity worldwide. &#160;

The supply shock was triggered by disagreements &#160;

between 

OPEC and Russia, beginning in early March 2020, &#160;

which resulted in significant supply coming &#160;

onto the 

&#160;

market &#160;

and an oil price war. &#160;

These dual demand and supply shocks caused &#160;

oil prices to collapse as we exited 

the first quarter of 2020. 

&#160;

As we entered the second quarter of 2020, predictions &#160;

of COVID-19 driven global oil demand losses 

intensified, with forecasts &#160;

of unprecedented demand declines. &#160;

Based on these forecasts, OPEC plus nations 

held an emergency meeting, and in April they announced &#160;

a coordinated production cut that was unprecedented 

in both its magnitude and duration. &#160;

The OPEC plus agreement spans from May 2020 &#160;

until April 2022, with 

the volume of production cuts easing over time. &#160;

Additionally, non-OPEC plus countries, including the U.S., 

Canada, Brazil and other G-20 countries, &#160;

announced organic reductions to production through the &#160;

release of 

drilling rigs, frac crews, normal field decline &#160;

and curtailments. &#160;

Despite these planned production decreases, 

the supply cuts were not timely enough to overcome &#160;

significant demand decline. &#160;

Futures prices for April WTI 

closed under $20 a barrel for the first time &#160;

since 2001, followed by May WTI settling below zero on the &#160;

day 

before futures contracts expiry, as holders of May futures contracts struggled to exit &#160;

positions and avoid taking 

physical delivery. &#160;

As storage constraints approached, spot prices in &#160;

April for certain North American 

landlocked grades of crude oil were in the single digits &#160;

or even negative for particularly remote or low-grade 

crudes, while waterborne priced crudes such as &#160;

Brent sold at a relative advantage. &#160;

The extreme volatility 

experienced &#160;

in the first half of the year settled down in the &#160;

second half of the year, with WTI crude oil prices 

exiting the year near $50 per barrel. &#160;

&#160;

Since the start of the severe downturn, we have closely &#160;

monitored the market and taken prudent actions in 

response to this situation. &#160;

We entered 2020 in a position of relative strength, with cash and cash equivalents of 

more than $5 billion, short-term investments &#160;

of $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility &#160;

of $6 billion, totaling 

approximately $14 billion in available liquidity. &#160;

Additionally, we had several entity and asset sales 

agreements in place, which generated $1.3 billion &#160;

in proceeds from dispositions during 2020. &#160;

For more 

information about the sales of our Australia-West and non-core Lower 48 assets, see &#160;

Note 4&#8212;Asset 

Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

This relative advantage 

allowed us to be measured in our response to &#160;

the sudden change in business environment. &#160;

&#160;

In March, we announced an initial set of actions &#160;

to address the downturn and followed up with additional 

actions in April. &#160;

The combined announcements reflected a reduction &#160;

in our 2020 operating plan capital of $2.3 

billion, a reduction to our operating costs of &#160;

$600 million and suspension of our share &#160;

repurchase program. &#160;

These actions decreased uses of cash by approximately &#160;

$5 billion in 2020. &#160;

We also established a framework 

for evaluating our assets and implementing &#160;

economic production curtailments considering &#160;

the weakness in oil 

prices during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted &#160;

in taking an additional significant step of voluntarily 

curtailing production, predominantly from &#160;

operated North American assets. &#160;

Due to our strong balance sheet, 

we were in an advantaged position to forgo some production &#160;

and cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher 

cash flows for those volumes in the future. 

&#160;

In the second quarter, we curtailed production by an estimated 225 MBOED, &#160;

with 145 MBOED of the 

curtailments from the Lower 48, 40 MBOED from &#160;

Alaska and 30 MBOED from our Surmont operation &#160;

in 

Canada. &#160;

The remainder of the second-quarter curtailments &#160;

were primarily in Malaysia. &#160;

Other industry 

operators also cut production and development &#160;

plans and as we progressed through the second quarter, certain 

stay-at-home restrictions eased, which partially &#160;

restored lost demand, and WTI and Brent prices &#160;

exited the 

second quarter around $40 per barrel. &#160;

Based on our economic framework, we began &#160;

restoring production from 

voluntary curtailments in July, and with oil stabilizing around $40 per barrel, we &#160;

ended our curtailment 

program during the third quarter. &#160;

Curtailments in the third quarter averaged approximately &#160;

90 MBOED, with 

65 MBOED attributable to the Lower 48 and 15 MBOED &#160;

to Surmont. 

&#160;

In August 2020, we acquired &#160;

additional Montney acreage for cash consideration &#160;

of $382 million, after 

customary post-closing adjustments. &#160;

We also assumed $31 million in financing obligations for associated 

partially owned infrastructure. &#160;

This acquisition consisted primarily &#160;

of undeveloped properties and included 

140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed &#160;

asset Montney zone, which is directly adjacent &#160;

to our 

existing Montney position. &#160;

The transaction increased our Montney acreage &#160;

position to approximately 295,000 

net acres with a 100 percent working interest. &#160;

See Note 4&#8212;Acquisitions and Dispositions in &#160;

the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional &#160;

information. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In October 2020, we announced an increase to our &#160;

quarterly dividend from $0.42 per share to $0.43 &#160;

per share 

and resumed &#160;

share repurchases before suspending our &#160;

share repurchase program upon entry into &#160;

our definitive 

agreement to acquire Concho. &#160;

We resumed shares repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our 

Concho acquisition. &#160;

We ended the year with over $12 billion of liquidity, comprised of $3.0 billion in cash 

and cash equivalents, $3.6 billion in short-term &#160;

investments, and available borrowings under our credit &#160;

facility 

of $5.7 billion. &#160;

&#160;

Our expectation is that commodity prices will &#160;

remain cyclical and volatile, and a successful &#160;

business strategy 

in the E&#38;P industry must be resilient in &#160;

lower price environments, at the same time retaining &#160;

upside during 

periods of higher prices. &#160;

While we are not impervious to current market &#160;

conditions, we believe our decisive 

actions over the last several years of focusing on free &#160;

cash flow generation, high-grading our asset &#160;

base, 

lowering the cost of supply of our investment &#160;

resource portfolio, and strengthening our &#160;

balance sheet have put 

us in a strong relative position compared to our &#160;

independent E&#38;P peers. &#160;

We remain committed to the core 

principles of our value proposition, namely, free cash flow generation, &#160;

a strong balance sheet, commitment to 

differential returns of and on capital, &#160;

and ESG leadership. 

&#160;

Our workforce and operations have adjusted to &#160;

mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic. &#160;

We have 

operations in remote areas with confined spaces, &#160;

such as offshore platforms, the North Slope of Alaska, &#160;

Curtis 

Island in Australia, western Canada and Indonesia, &#160;

where viruses could rapidly spread. &#160;

Personnel are asked to 

perform a self-assessment for symptoms of illness &#160;

each day and, when appropriate, are subject to &#160;

more 

restrictive measures before traveling to and working &#160;

on location. &#160;

Staffing levels in certain operating locations 

have been reduced to minimize health risk exposure &#160;

and increase social distancing. &#160;

A portion of our office 

staff have continued to work successfully remotely, with offices around the world carefully &#160;

designing and 

executing a flexible, phased reentry, following national, state and local guidelines. &#160;

These mitigation measures 

have thus far been effective at reducing business operation &#160;

disruptions. &#160;

Workforce health and safety remains 

the overriding driver for our actions and we have &#160;

demonstrated our ability to adapt to local &#160;

conditions as 

warranted. &#160;

&#160;

The marketing and supply chain &#160;

side of our business has also adapted in response &#160;

to COVID-19. &#160;

Our 

commercial organization managed transportation commitments &#160;

during our voluntary curtailment program. &#160;

Our supply chain function is proactively working &#160;

with vendors to ensure the continuity of our business 

operations, monitor distressed service and materials &#160;

providers, capture deflation opportunities, and pursue &#160;

cost 

reduction efforts. &#160;

We also enhanced our focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period &#160;

and 

requested credit assurances when applicable. &#160;

&#160;

Operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business. &#160;

In 2020, production of 1,127 MBOED 

generated cash provided by operating activities &#160;

of $4.8 billion. &#160;

We invested $4.7 &#160;

billion into the business in 

the form of capital expenditures, including $0.5 &#160;

billion of acquisition capital, and paid dividends &#160;

to 

shareholders of $1.8 billion. &#160;

Production decreased 221 MBOED or 16 percent &#160;

in 2020, compared to 2019. &#160;

Production excluding &#160;

Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED. &#160;

Adjusting for estimated curtailments &#160;

of 

approximately 80 MBOED; closed acquisitions &#160;

and dispositions; &#160;

and excluding Libya, production for 2020 

would have been 1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 &#160;

MBOED compared with 2019 production. &#160;

This decrease 

was primarily due to normal field decline, partly &#160;

offset by new wells online in the Lower 48, Canada, &#160;

Norway, 

Alaska and China. &#160;

Production from Libya averaged 9 MBOED &#160;

as it was in force majeure during a significant 

portion of the year. 

&#160;

Key Operating and Financial Summary 

&#160;

Significant items during 2020 and recent announcements &#160;

included the following: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Enhanced both our portfolio and financial framework through the &#160;

acquisition of Concho in an all-stock 

transaction, as well as purchasing bolt-on acreage in Canada and Lower &#160;

48. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Full-year production, excluding Libya, of 1,118 &#160;

MBOED; curtailed approximately 80 MBOED during the 

year. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Cash provided by operating activities was $4.8 billion. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Generated $1.3 billion in disposition proceeds from non-core asset sales. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Distributed $1.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $0.9 billion of shares. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.0 billion and &#160;

short-term investments of $3.6 

billion, &#160;

equaling $6.6 billion in ending cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Announced two significant discoveries in Norway and achieved first production &#160;

at Tor II; continued 

appraisal drilling and started up first pads and related infrastructure &#160;

in Montney. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Adopted a Paris-aligned climate risk framework with ambition to achieve net &#160;

-zero operated emissions by 

2050 as part of our commitment to ESG excellence. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Recognized impairments of proved and unproved properties totaling $1.3 &#160;

billion after-tax. 

&#160;

Business Environment 

&#160;

Brent crude oil prices averaged $42 per barrel in 2020, &#160;

compared with $64 per barrel in 2019. &#160;

The energy 

industry has periodically experienced this type &#160;

of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand &#160;

conditions 

and such volatility may persist for the foreseeable &#160;

future. &#160;

Commodity prices are the most significant &#160;

factor 

impacting our profitability and related reinvestment &#160;

of operating cash flows into our business. &#160;

Our strategy is 

to create value through price cycles by delivering &#160;

on the foundational principles that underpin our &#160;

value 

proposition; free cash flow generation, &#160;

a strong balance sheet, &#160;

commitment to differential returns of and on 

capital, &#160;

and ESG leadership. 

&#160;

Operational and Financial Factors Affecting &#160;

Profitability 

The focus areas we believe will drive our success &#160;

through the price cycles include: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Free cash flow generation. &#160;

This is a core principle of our value proposition. &#160;

Our goal is to achieve 

strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, &#160;

controlling our costs, and safely and reliably 

delivering production. &#160;

Throughout the price cycles, we expect to make capital &#160;

investments sufficient 

to sustain production. &#160;

Free cash flow provides funds that are available &#160;

to return to shareholders, 

strengthen the balance sheet to deliver on our &#160;

priorities through the price cycles, or reinvest back into 

the business for future cash flow expansion. 

&#160;

o

&#160;

Maintain capital allocation discipline. &#160;

We participate in a commodity price-driven and 

capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment &#160;

decision is made 

to the time an asset is operational and generates cash &#160;

flow. &#160;

As a result, we must invest 

significant capital dollars to explore for new oil &#160;

and gas fields, develop newly discovered 

fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines &#160;

and LNG facilities. &#160;

We allocate 

capital across a geographically diverse, low cost &#160;

of supply resource base, which combined 

with legacy assets results in low production decline. &#160;

Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent 

price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return &#160;

on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. &#160;

Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, &#160;

foreign exchange, price related inflation and 

G&#38;A. &#160;

In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous &#160;

approach that evaluates projects 

using this cost of supply criteria, which we believe &#160;

will lead to value maximization and cash 

flow expansion using an optimized investment &#160;

pace, not production growth for growth&#8217;s sake. &#160;

Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment &#160;

of sufficient capital to sustain production 

and pay the existing dividend. &#160;

Additional capital may be allocated toward &#160;

growth, but 

discipline will be maintained. &#160;

&#160;

In February 2021, we announced 2021 operating &#160;

plan capital for the combined company of 

$5.5 billion. &#160;

The plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current &#160;

production and $0.4 billion for 

investment in major projects, primarily in &#160;

Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration 

appraisal activity. 

&#160;

The operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion &#160;

is expected to deliver production from the 

combined company of approximately 1.5 MMBOED &#160;

in 2021. &#160;

This production guidance 

excludes Libya. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

o

&#160;

Control costs and expenses. &#160;

Controlling operating and overhead costs, &#160;

without compromising 

safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. &#160;

We monitor these costs using 

various methodologies that are reported to senior management &#160;

monthly, on both an absolute-

dollar basis and a per-unit basis. &#160;

Managing operating and overhead costs is &#160;

critical to 

maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity &#160;

price 

environment. &#160;

The ability to control our operating and overhead &#160;

costs impacts our ability to 

deliver strong cash from operations. &#160;

In 2020, our production and operating expenses &#160;

were 18 

percent lower than 2019, primarily due to decreased &#160;

wellwork and transportation costs 

resulting from production curtailments across &#160;

our North American operated assets as well as 

the absence of costs related to our U.K. and &#160;

Australia-West divestitures. &#160;

For more 

information related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures, see note 4&#8212;Acquisitions &#160;

and 

Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements. 

&#160;

At the time of the Concho acquisition announcement &#160;

in October 2020, we announced planned 

cost reductions and quantified $350 million &#160;

of annual expense savings expected to be 

achieved by 2022. &#160;

These reductions included approximately $150 million &#160;

due to streamlining 

our internal organization to appropriate levels given the &#160;

current industry environment and 

recent asset sales; $100 million of G&#38;A and &#160;

G&#38;G due to a refocused exploration program; 

and $100 million of redundant G&#38;A costs on &#160;

a combined basis related to the Concho 

acquisition. &#160;

Subsequent to the transaction announcement, &#160;

we identified $250 million of 

further cost reductions from the combined companies &#160;

to be achieved by 2022. 

&#160;

o

&#160;

Optimize our portfolio. &#160;

In January 2021, we completed the acquisition &#160;

of Concho and 

significantly increased our unconventional portfolio &#160;

with years of low cost of supply 

investments. &#160;

The addition of complementary acreage in the &#160;

Delaware and Midland basins 

creates a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading &#160;

unconventional positions in the 

Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48. &#160;

We added to our unconventional Montney position 

with an asset acquisition that consisted primarily &#160;

of undeveloped properties directly adjacent 

to our existing acreage. &#160;

&#160;

These acquisitions followed several non-core asset &#160;

sales earlier in the year including 

Australia-West in our Asia Pacific segment, &#160;

and Niobrara and Waddell Ranch in the Lower 

48. &#160;

We managed the portfolio well during a turbulent year, with asset sales entered at the end 

of 2019 generating $1.3 billion of proceeds from dispositions &#160;

in the first half of 2020, 

followed by opportunistic acquisitions of unconventional &#160;

assets in the second half of 2020 

after commodity prices had dropped. &#160;

We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine 

whether they compete for capital within our portfolio &#160;

and will optimize the portfolio as 

necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

A strong balance sheet. &#160;

We believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as 

ours. &#160;

Our strong operating performance buffered by a solid &#160;

balance sheet enables us to deliver on our 

priorities through the price cycles. &#160;

Our priorities include execution of our &#160;

development plans, 

maintaining a growing dividend, and returning competitive &#160;

returns of capital to shareholders. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Commitment to differential returns of and on capital. &#160;

We believe in delivering value to our 

shareholders via a growing, sustainable dividend &#160;

supplemented by additional returns of &#160;

capital, 

including share repurchases. &#160;

In 2020, we paid dividends on our common stock &#160;

of approximately $1.8 

billion and repurchased $0.9 &#160;

billion of our common stock. &#160;

Combined, our dividend and repurchases 

represented &#160;

57 percent of our net cash provided by operating &#160;

activities. &#160;

Since we initiated our current 

share repurchase program in late 2016, we have repurchased &#160;

189 million shares for $10.5 billion, 

which represents approximately 15 percent of shares &#160;

outstanding as of September 30, 2016. &#160;

As of 

December 31, 2020, $14.5 billion of repurchase &#160;

authority remained of the $25 billion share repurchase 

program our Board of Directors had authorized. &#160;

Repurchases are made at management&#8217;s discretion, 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions &#160;

and other factors. &#160;

See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors Our 

ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase &#160;

shares is subject to certain considerations.&#8221; 

&#160;

In October 2020, we announced that our Board &#160;

of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly 

dividend of $0.42 per share to $0.43 per share. &#160;

In February 2021, we resumed share repurchases &#160;

after 

the completion of our Concho acquisition. &#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

ESG Leadership. &#160;

Safety and environmental stewardship, &#160;

including the operating integrity of our 

assets, remain our highest priorities, and we &#160;

are committed to protecting the health and &#160;

safety of 

everyone who has a role in our operations and &#160;

the communities in which we operate. &#160;

We strive to 

conduct our business with respect and care for &#160;

both the local and global environment and 

systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business &#160;

growth. &#160;

Demonstrating our commitment to 

sustainability and environmental stewardship, in &#160;

October 2020, we announced our adoption of a Paris-

aligned climate risk framework as part of our continued &#160;

leadership in ESG excellence. &#160;

This 

comprehensive climate risk strategy should enable &#160;

us to sustainably meet global energy demand while 

delivering competitive returns through the energy transition. &#160;

We have set a target to reduce our gross 

operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity &#160;

by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by 2030, &#160;

with an 

ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 for operated &#160;

emissions. &#160;

We are advocating for reduction of 

scope 3 end-use emissions intensity through our &#160;

support for a U.S. carbon price and reaffirmed &#160;

our 

commitment to the Climate Leadership Council. &#160;

We have joined the World &#160;

Bank Flaring Initiative to 

work towards zero routine flaring of gas by 2030 &#160;

and are the first U.S.-based oil and gas company &#160;

to 

adopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Add to our proved reserve base. &#160;

We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: 

&#160;

o

&#160;

Purchases of increased interests in existing &#160;

fields and acquisitions. 

o

&#160;

Application of new technologies and processes &#160;

to improve recovery from existing fields. 

o

&#160;

Successful exploration, exploitation and development &#160;

of new and existing fields. 

&#160;

As required by current authoritative guidelines, &#160;

the estimated future date when an asset will reach &#160;

the 

end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month &#160;

first-of-month average prices and current 

costs. &#160;

This date estimates when production will &#160;

end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. &#160;

Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from &#160;

year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also 

changes. &#160;

Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices &#160;

rise. &#160;

&#160;

Reserve replacement represents the net change in &#160;

proved reserves, net of production, divided &#160;

by our 

current year production, as shown in our supplemental &#160;

reserve table disclosures. &#160;

Our reserve 

replacement was negative 86 percent in 2020, reflecting &#160;

the impact of lower prices, which reduced 

reserves by approximately 600 MMBOE. &#160;

Our organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net 

decrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases, &#160;

was negative 84 percent in 2020. &#160;

&#160;

In the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve &#160;

replacement was 59 percent, primarily 

impacted by lower prices in 2020. &#160;

Our organic reserve replacement during the three years &#160;

ended 

December 31, 2020, which excluded &#160;

a net increase of 89 MMBOE related to sales &#160;

and purchases, was 

53 percent. 

&#160;

Access to additional resources may become increasingly &#160;

difficult as commodity prices can make 

projects uneconomic or unattractive. &#160;

In addition, prohibition of direct investment &#160;

in some nations, 

national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, &#160;

and lack of access 

to high-potential areas due to environmental or other &#160;

regulation may negatively impact our &#160;

ability to 

increase our reserve base. &#160;

As such, the timing and level at which we add &#160;

to our reserve base may, or 

may not, allow us to replace our production &#160;

over subsequent years. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Apply technical capability. &#160;

We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely 

deliver on our plans. &#160;

Technical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically &#160;

convert 

additional resources to reserves, achieve greater &#160;

operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental 

impact. &#160;

Companywide, we continue to leverage knowledge &#160;

of technological successes across our 

operations. &#160;

&#160;

We have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to &#160;

work and operate 

more efficiently. &#160;

Predictive analytics have been adopted in our operations &#160;

and planning process. &#160;

Artificial intelligence, machine learning and &#160;

deep learning are being used for emissions &#160;

monitoring, 

seismic advancements and advanced controls in &#160;

our field operations. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Attract, develop and retain a talented work force. &#160;

We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals 

with the knowledge and skills to successfully &#160;

execute our business strategy in a manner &#160;

exemplifying 

our core values and ethics. &#160;

We offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the 

best early career talent. &#160;

We also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad 

range of expertise and experience. &#160;

We promote continued learning, development and technical 

training through structured development programs &#160;

designed to enhance the technical and functional 

skills of our employees. 

&#160;

Other Factors Affecting &#160;

Profitability 

Other significant factors that can affect our profitability &#160;

include: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Energy commodity prices. &#160;

Our earnings and operating cash flows generally &#160;

correlate with industry 

price levels for crude oil and natural gas. &#160;

Industry price levels are subject to factors external &#160;

to the 

company and over which we have no control, including &#160;

but not limited to global economic health, 

supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil &#160;

unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by &#160;

OPEC 

and other producing countries, environmental laws, &#160;

tax regulations, governmental policies and 

weather-related disruptions. &#160;

The following graph depicts the average benchmark &#160;

prices for WTI 

crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural &#160;

gas: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Brent crude oil prices averaged $41.68 per barrel &#160;

in 2020, a decrease of 35 percent compared &#160;

with 

$64.30 per barrel in 2019. &#160;

Similarly, WTI crude oil prices decreased 31 percent from $57.02 per 

barrel in 2019 to $39.37 per barrel in 2020. &#160;

Crude oil prices were lower due to the dual &#160;

demand and 

supply shocks. &#160;

The demand shock was triggered by the &#160;

COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to 

have unprecedented social and economic consequences. &#160;

The supply shock was triggered by 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

disagreements between OPEC and Russia, beginning &#160;

in early March 2020, which resulted in 

significant supply coming onto the market &#160;

and created higher inventory levels. 

&#160;

Henry Hub natural gas prices &#160;

decreased 21 percent from an average of $2.63 &#160;

per MMBTU in 2019 to 

$2.08 per MMBTU in 2020. &#160;

Henry Hub prices were depressed due to high &#160;

storage levels and weak 

demand. 

&#160;

Our realized bitumen price decreased 75 percent &#160;

from an average of $31.72 per barrel &#160;

in 2019 to $8.02 

per barrel in 2020. &#160;

The decrease was largely driven by weakness in WTI, &#160;

reflective of impacts from 

the COVID-19 pandemic. &#160;

The WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty remained fairly &#160;

flat as 

curtailment orders imposed by the Alberta Government, &#160;

which limited production from the province, 

continued throughout 2020. &#160;

We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through 

improvements in alternate blend capability which &#160;

results in lower diluent costs and access &#160;

to the U.S. 

Gulf Coast market through rail and pipeline contracts. 

&#160;

Our worldwide annual average realized price decreased &#160;

34 percent from $48.78

&#160;

per BOE in 2019 to 

$32.15

&#160;

per BOE in 2020 primarily due to lower realized &#160;

oil, natural gas and bitumen prices. &#160;

&#160;

North America&#8217;s energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource &#160;

scarcity to one 

of abundance. &#160;

In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing &#160;

and horizontal drilling in 

unconventional formations has led to increased industry &#160;

actual and forecasted crude oil and natural 

gas production in the U.S. &#160;

Although providing significant short- &#160;

and long-term growth opportunities 

for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development &#160;

of 

unconventional plays could also have adverse financial &#160;

implications to us, including: an extended 

period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; &#160;

and delay of plans to develop areas such as 

unconventional fields. &#160;

Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would &#160;

be reduced, and 

additional asset impairments might be possible. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Impairments. &#160;

We participate in a capital-intensive industry. &#160;

At times, our PP&#38;E and investments 

become impaired when, for example, commodity &#160;

prices decline significantly for long &#160;

periods of time, 

our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a &#160;

decision to dispose of an asset leads to &#160;

a write-down 

to its fair value. &#160;

We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory 

drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material &#160;

impairment of leasehold values. &#160;

As we optimize 

our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible &#160;

we may incur future losses upon sale or &#160;

impairment 

charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments &#160;

in nonconsolidated entities accounted for 

under the equity method, and unproved properties. &#160;

For additional information on our impairments, 

see Note 7&#8212;Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses and Note 8&#8212;Impairments, in &#160;

the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Effective tax rate. &#160;

Our operations are in countries with different tax rates &#160;

and fiscal structures. &#160;

Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, &#160;

our overall 

effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods &#160;

based on the &#8220;mix&#8221; of before-tax earnings 

within our global operations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Fiscal and regulatory environment. &#160;

Our operations can be affected by changing economic, &#160;

regulatory 

and political environments in the various countries &#160;

in which we operate, including the U.S. &#160;

Civil 

unrest or strained relationships with governments &#160;

may impact our operations or investments. &#160;

These 

changing environments could negatively impact our &#160;

results of operations, and further changes to 

increase government fiscal take could have a &#160;

negative impact on future operations. &#160;

Our management 

carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory &#160;

environment when evaluating projects or &#160;

determining the 

levels and locations of our activity.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Outlook 

&#160;

Production and Capital 

In February 2021, we announced 2021 operating &#160;

plan capital for the combined company of $5.5 &#160;

billion. &#160;

The 

plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current &#160;

production and $0.4 billion for investment &#160;

in major projects, 

primarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing &#160;

exploration appraisal activity. 

&#160;

The operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion &#160;

is expected to deliver production from the combined &#160;

company 

of approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021. &#160;

This production guidance excludes Libya. 

&#160;

Restructuring 

As a result of the acquisition of Concho, we commenced &#160;

a restructuring program in the first quarter &#160;

of 2021 in 

association with combining the operations of the &#160;

two companies. &#160;

We expect to incur significant non-recurring 

transaction and acquisition-related costs in &#160;

2021 for employee severance payments; incremental &#160;

pension 

benefit costs related to the workforce reductions; employee &#160;

retention costs; employee relocations; fees &#160;

paid to 

financial, legal, and accounting advisors; and &#160;

filing fees. &#160;

We currently cannot estimate these costs, as well as 

other unanticipated items, &#160;

and expect to recognize the majority &#160;

of these expenses in the first quarter of 2021. 

&#160;

Operating Segments 

&#160;

We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily &#160;

defined by geographic region: 

Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East &#160;

and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International. 

&#160;

Corporate and Other represents income and costs &#160;

not directly associated with an operating &#160;

segment, such as 

most interest expense, premiums incurred on the &#160;

early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, &#160;

certain 

technology activities, as well as licensing revenues. &#160;

&#160;

Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical &#160;

tables provided at the beginning of the operating 

segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity &#160;

prices and production. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective with the third quarter of 2020, we have restructured our segments to align with &#160;

changes to our 

internal organization. &#160;

The Middle East business was realigned from the Asia Pacific and Middle East &#160;

segment 

to the Europe and North Africa segment. &#160;

The segments have been renamed the Asia Pacific &#160;

segment and the 

Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. &#160;

We have revised segment information disclosures and 

segment performance metrics presented within our results of operations for the &#160;

current and prior years. 

This section of the Form 10-K &#160;

discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020 &#160;

and 2019. &#160;

2020 vs. 2019 

&#160;

Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips &#160;

decreased $9.9 billion in 2020. &#160;

The decrease was mainly due 

to: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower realized commodity prices. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower sales volumes due to normal field decline, &#160;

asset dispositions and production curtailments. &#160;

For 

additional information related to dispositions, &#160;

see Note 4&#8212;Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions &#160;

in the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

The absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated &#160;

with the completion of the sale of two 

ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries. &#160;

For additional information, see Note 4&#8212;Asset &#160;

Acquisitions and 

Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements. 

&#9679;

&#160;

An unrealized loss of $855 million after-tax &#160;

on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2020, 

as compared to a $649 million after-tax unrealized &#160;

gain on those shares in 2019. 

&#9679;

&#160;

A $648 million after-tax impairment for the associated &#160;

carrying value of capitalized undeveloped 

leasehold costs and an equity method investment &#160;

related to our Alaska North Slope Gas &#160;

asset. &#160;

For 

additional information, see Note 7&#8212;Suspended &#160;

Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Increased impairments

&#160;

primarily related to developed properties &#160;

in our non-core assets which were 

written down to fair value due to lower commodity &#160;

prices and development plan changes. &#160;

For 

additional information, see Note 8&#8212;Impairments &#160;

and Note 14&#8212;Fair Value Measurement in the Notes 

to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The absence of other income of $317 million after-tax &#160;

related to our settlement agreement with 

PDVSA. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

These decreases in net income (loss) were partly &#160;

offset by: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower production and operating expenses, primarily &#160;

due to the absence of costs related to our U.K. 

and Australia-West divestitures and decreased wellwork and transportation costs &#160;

resulting from 

production curtailments across our North American &#160;

operated assets. 

&#9679;

&#160;

A $597 million after-tax gain on dispositions related &#160;

to our Australia-West divestiture. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower DD&#38;A expenses, primarily due to lower &#160;

volumes related to normal field decline and 

production curtailments as well as impacts &#160;

of our Australia-West and U.K. divestitures. &#160;

Partly 

offsetting this decrease, was higher DD&#38;A expenses &#160;

due to price-related downward reserve revisions. 

&#160;

&#160;

Income Statement Analysis 

&#160;

2020 vs. 2019 

&#160;

Sales and other operating revenues decreased 42 percent &#160;

in 2020, mainly due to lower realized commodity 

prices and lower sales volumes. &#160;

Sales volumes decreased due to normal field &#160;

decline, production curtailments 

from our North American operated assets and the &#160;

divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third &#160;

quarter of 2019 and 

our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020. &#160;

&#160;

Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $347 million &#160;

in 2020, primarily due to lower earnings from &#160;

QG3 and 

APLNG because of lower LNG prices. &#160;

Partly offsetting this decrease was the absence &#160;

of impairments related 

to equity method investments in our Lower 48 segment &#160;

of $155 million and the absence of a $118 million 

deferred tax adjustment at QG3, reported in our &#160;

Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. 

&#160;

Gain on dispositions decreased $1.4 billion in &#160;

2020, primarily due to the absence of a $1.7 billion &#160;

before-tax 

gain associated with the completion of the sale &#160;

of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries. &#160;

Partly offsetting the 

decrease was a $587 million before-tax gain associated &#160;

with our Australia-West divestiture. &#160;

For more 

information related to these dispositions, see Note &#160;

4&#8212;Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions &#160;

in the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

Other income (loss) decreased $1.9 billion &#160;

in 2020, primarily due to a before-tax unrealized &#160;

loss of $855 

million on our CVE common shares in 2020, and &#160;

the absence of a $649 million before-tax unrealized &#160;

gain on 

those shares in 2019. &#160;

Additionally, other income (loss) decreased due to the absence of $325 million &#160;

before-

tax related to our settlement agreement with PDVSA. &#160;

&#160;

For discussion of our CVE shares, see Note 6&#8212;Investment &#160;

in Cenovus Energy in the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. &#160;

For discussion of our PDVSA settlement, &#160;

see Note 12&#8212;Contingencies and 

Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements. &#160;

&#160;

Purchased commodities decreased 32 percent in &#160;

2020, primarily due to lower natural gas &#160;

and crude oil prices; 

lower crude oil and natural gas volumes purchased; &#160;

and the divestiture of our U.K. assets in the &#160;

third quarter of 

2019 and our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020. &#160;

&#160;

Production and operating expenses decreased $978 &#160;

million in 2020, primarily due to reduced activities &#160;

and 

transportation costs associated with lower activity &#160;

across our North American operated assets in &#160;

response to 

the low commodity price environment and the &#160;

absence of costs related to our U.K. and Australia-West 

divestitures. 

&#160;

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased &#160;

$126 million in 2020, primarily due to lower &#160;

costs 

associated with compensation and benefits, &#160;

including mark to market impacts of certain &#160;

key employee 

compensation programs. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Exploration expenses increased $714 million &#160;

in 2020, primarily due to an $828 million before-tax &#160;

impairment 

for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped &#160;

leasehold costs related to our Alaska &#160;

North Slope Gas 

asset. &#160;

Partly offsetting this increase, was the absence of &#160;

a $141 million before-tax leasehold impairment 

expense due to our decision to discontinue exploration &#160;

activities in the Central Louisiana Austin &#160;

Chalk trend. &#160;

For additional information, see Note 7&#8212;Suspended &#160;

Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

Impairments increased $408 million in &#160;

2020, primarily related to developed properties &#160;

in our non-core assets 

which were written down to fair value due to lower &#160;

commodity prices and development plan changes. &#160;

For

&#160;

Taxes other than income taxes decreased $199 million in 2020, primarily due &#160;

to lower commodity prices and 

volumes. 

&#160;

Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased &#160;

$138 million in 2020, due to gains recognized &#160;

&#160;

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on &#160;

a worldwide 

basis. &#160;

At December 31, 2020, our operations were &#160;

producing in the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, 

Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. 

&#160;

2020 vs. 2019 

&#160;

Total production, including Libya, of 1,127 MBOED decreased 221 MBOED or 16 &#160;

percent in 2020 compared 

with 2019, &#160;

primarily due to: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Normal field decline. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third &#160;

quarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the 

second quarter of 2020. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Production curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED, &#160;

primarily from North American operated 

assets and Malaysia, in response to the low crude &#160;

oil price environment. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Less production in Libya due to the forced shutdown &#160;

of the Es Sider export terminal and other &#160;

eastern 

export terminals after a period of civil unrest. 

&#160;

The decrease in production during 2020 was partly &#160;

offset by: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

New wells online in the Lower 48, Canada, &#160;

Norway, Alaska and China. 

&#160;

Production excluding Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED. &#160;

Adjusting for estimated curtailments &#160;

of 

approximately 80 MBOED and closed acquisitions &#160;

and dispositions, production for 2020 would &#160;

have been 

1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 MBOED compared &#160;

with 2019. &#160;

This decrease was primarily due to normal 

field decline, partly offset by new wells online in the &#160;

Lower 48, Canada, Norway, Alaska and China. &#160;

Production from Libya averaged 9 MBOED as it &#160;

was in force majeure during a significant portion &#160;

of the year.

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports &#160;

and markets crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. &#160;

In 2020, Alaska contributed 28 percent of our consolidated &#160;

liquids production and less than 1 percent of our 

consolidated natural gas production. 

&#160;

2020 vs. 2019 

&#160;

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips 

Alaska reported a loss of $719 million in &#160;

2020, compared with earnings of $1,520 million &#160;

in 2019. &#160;

Earnings 

were negatively impacted by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower realized crude oil prices. 

&#9679;

&#160;

A $648 million after-tax impairment associated &#160;

with the carrying value of our Alaska North Slope &#160;

Gas 

assets. &#160;

For additional information, see Note 7&#8212;Suspended &#160;

Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower sales volumes, primarily due to normal field &#160;

decline and production curtailments &#160;

at our 

operated assets on the North Slope&#8212;the Greater &#160;

Kuparuk Area (GKA) and Western North Slope 

(WNS). 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher DD&#38;A expenses, primarily from &#160;

increased DD&#38;A rates due to price-related downward 

reserve revisions, partly offset by lower production &#160;

volumes. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Increased exploration expenses, primarily &#160;

due to higher dry hole costs and expenses related &#160;

to the 

early cancellation of our winter exploration program. 

&#160;

Earnings were positively impacted by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower production and operating expenses, primarily &#160;

associated with lower transportation and 

terminaling costs as well as lower activities &#160;

across our assets. 

&#160;

Production 

Average production decreased 20 MBOED in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Normal field decline. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Production curtailments at our operated assets on &#160;

the North Slope&#8212;GKA and WNS&#8212;of 8 MBOED 

in response to the low crude oil price environment. 

&#160;

These production decreases were partly offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower downtime due to the absence of planned &#160;

turnarounds at the Greater Prudhoe Area. 

&#9679;

&#160;

New wells online at our operated assets on the &#160;

North Slope&#8212;GKA and WNS.

During 

2020, the Lower 48 contributed 40 percent of our &#160;

consolidated liquids production and 44 percent of &#160;

our 

consolidated natural gas production. &#160;

&#160;

2020 vs. 2019

Lower 48 reported a loss of $1,122 million in 2020, &#160;

compared with earnings of $436 million &#160;

in 2019. &#160;

Earnings were negatively impacted by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower crude oil sales volumes due to normal &#160;

field decline and production curtailments. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher impairments, primarily related to developed &#160;

properties in our non-core assets which were 

written down to fair value due to lower commodity &#160;

prices and development plan changes. &#160;

See Note 

8&#8212;Impairments and Note 14&#8212;Fair Value Measurement, for additional information. &#160;

&#160;

Earnings were positively impacted by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower exploration expenses, primarily &#160;

due to the absence of a combined $197 million &#160;

after-tax of 

leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated &#160;

with our decision to discontinue exploration 

activities in the Central Louisiana Austin &#160;

Chalk. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower DD&#38;A expenses, primarily due to normal &#160;

field decline and production curtailments, &#160;

partly 

offset by increased DD&#38;A rates due to price-related downward &#160;

reserve revisions. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower production and operating expenses, primarily &#160;

due to lower activities driven by production 

curtailments in response to the low price environment &#160;

and disposition impacts. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower taxes other than income taxes, primarily &#160;

due to lower realized prices and volumes. 

&#160;

Production 

Total average production decreased 66 MBOED in 2020 compared with 2019, &#160;

primarily due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Normal field decline. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Production curtailments of approximately 55 MBOED &#160;

in response to the low crude oil price 

environment. 

&#160;

These production decreases were partly offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

New wells online from the Eagle Ford, Permian and &#160;

Bakken.

&#160;

Our Canadian operations consist of the Surmont &#160;

oil sands development in Alberta and the liquids-rich 

Montney unconventional play in British Columbia. &#160;

In 2020, Canada contributed 9 percent of our &#160;

consolidated 

liquids production and 3 percent of our consolidated &#160;

natural gas production. 

&#160;

2020 vs. 2019

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips 

Canada operations reported a loss of $326 million &#160;

in 2020 compared with earnings of $279 million &#160;

in 2019. &#160;

Earnings decreased mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower realized bitumen prices.

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher DD&#38;A expenses, primarily due to increased volumes and DD&#38;A rates &#160;

from Montney production.

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower bitumen sales due to production curtailments at Surmont.

&#160;

&#160;

Earnings were positively impacted by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Increased Montney production from Pad 1 &#38; 2 wells online and partial &#160;

year production from the Kelt 

acquisition completed in August of 2020. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Production 

Total average production increased 7 MBOED in 2020 compared with 2019. &#160;

The production increase was 

primarily due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Increased liquids and natural gas production from Montney Pad 1 &#38; 2 wells online &#160;

and partial year 

production from the Kelt acquisition completed in August of 2020.

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Decreased mandated production curtailments imposed by the Alberta government.

&#160;

&#160;

The production increase was partly offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower bitumen production, &#160;

primarily due to voluntary curtailments at Surmont in response to the low price 

environment of 12 MBOED.

Earnings for Europe, &#160;

Middle East and North Africa operations &#160;

of $448 million decreased $2,722 million in 

2020 compared with 2019. &#160;

The decrease in earnings was primarily &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

The absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated &#160;

with the completion of the sale of two 

ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries. &#160;

For additional information, see Note 4&#8212;Asset &#160;

Acquisitions and 

Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to &#160;

lower LNG sales prices. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower realized crude oil prices in Norway. 

&#160;

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the effective tax rate within &#160;

our equity method investment in the Europe, Middle 

East and North Africa segment increased. 

&#160;

Consolidated Production 

Average consolidated production decreased 88 MBOED in 2020, compared with 2019. &#160;

The decrease was 

mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

The absence of production related to our U.K. &#160;

disposition in the third quarter of 2019. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower volumes from Libya due to a cessation of &#160;

production following a period of civil unrest. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Normal field decline. 

&#160;

These production decreases were partly offset by:

Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia. &#160;

During 2020, &#160;

Asia Pacific reported earnings of $962 million &#160;

in 2020, compared with $1,483 million in &#160;

2019. &#160;

The decrease in 

earnings was mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower sales volumes, primarily from lower LNG &#160;

sales due to the Australia-West divestiture; lower 

crude oil sales volumes in Malaysia, primarily &#160;

due to production curtailments; and lower crude &#160;

oil sales 

volumes in China due to the expiration of the Panyu &#160;

production license. &#160;

For more information related to 

our Australia-West divestiture, see Note 4&#8212;Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the &#160;

Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower realized commodity prices. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower equity in earnings of affiliates from APLNG, mainly &#160;

due to lower LNG sales prices. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The absence of a $164 million income tax benefit &#160;

related to deepwater incentive tax credits &#160;

from the 

Malaysia Block G. 

&#160;

Earnings were positively impacted by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

A $597 million after-tax gain on disposition related &#160;

to our Australia-West divestiture. 

&#160;

Consolidated Production 

Average consolidated production decreased 28 percent in 2020, compared with 2019. &#160;

The decrease was 

primarily due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

The divestiture of our Australia-West assets. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Normal field decline. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher unplanned downtime due to the rupture &#160;

of a third-party pipeline impacting gas production from 

the Kebabangan Field in Malaysia. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The expiration of the Panyu production license in &#160;

China. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Production curtailments of 4 MBOED in Malaysia. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

These production decreases were partly offset by:

The Other International segment includes exploration &#160;

As a result of our completed Concho acquisition &#160;

on 

January 15, 2021, we refocused our exploration &#160;

program and announced our intent to pursue a managed &#160;

exit

&#160;

Other International operations reported a loss of $64 &#160;

million in 2020, &#160;

compared with earnings of $263 million 

in 2019. &#160;

The decrease in earnings was primarily due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

The absence of $317 million after-tax in other &#160;

income from a settlement award with PDVSA 

associated with prior operations in Venezuela. &#160;

award, see Note 12&#8212;Contingencies and Commitments, &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Increased exploration expenses, primarily &#160;

due to dry hole costs and a full impairment of &#160;

Net 

interest expense increased $58 million in 2020 compared &#160;

primarily due to lower interest income 

related to lower cash and cash equivalent balances &#160;

and yield. 

&#160;

Corporate G&#38;A expenses include compensation &#160;

programs and staff costs. &#160;

These costs decreased by $52 

million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily &#160;

due to mark to market adjustments associated &#160;

with certain 

compensation programs. 

&#160;

Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as &#160;

licensing revenues. &#160;

Activities are focused on both conventional and tight &#160;

oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, oil &#160;

sands, enhanced 

oil recovery and LNG. &#160;

Earnings from Technology decreased by $149 million in 2020 compared with 2019, 

primarily due to lower licensing revenues. &#160;

&#160;

The category &#8220;Other&#8221; includes certain foreign currency &#160;

segment, 

premiums incurred on the early retirement &#160;

of debt, unrealized holding gains or losses on equity &#160;

securities, and 

pension settlement expense. &#160;

Earnings in &#8220;Other&#8221; decreased by $1,763 million &#160;

in 2020 compared with 2019, 

primarily due to: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

An unrealized loss of $855 million after-tax &#160;

on our CVE common shares in 2020, &#160;

compared with a 

$649 million after-tax unrealized gain in 2019. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The absence of a $151 million tax benefit related &#160;

*Capital includes total debt and total equity. 

&#160;

To meet our short- &#160;

and long-term liquidity requirements, we look &#160;

to a variety of funding sources, including 

cash generated from operating activities, &#160;

proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper &#160;

and credit facility 

programs and our ability to sell securities &#160;

using our shelf registration statement. &#160;

In 2020, the primary uses of 

our available cash were $4,715 million to support &#160;

our ongoing capital expenditures and investments &#160;

program; 

$1,831 million to pay dividends on our common &#160;

stock; $892 million to repurchase our common &#160;

stock; and 

$658 million for net purchase of investments. &#160;

During 2020, cash and cash equivalents decreased &#160;

by $2,097 

million to $2,991 million. 

&#160;

We entered the year with a strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents &#160;

of over $5 billion, short-

term investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn &#160;

credit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately &#160;

$14 billion 

in available liquidity. &#160;

This strong foundation allowed us to be measured &#160;

in our response to the sudden change 

in business environment as we exited the first &#160;

quarter of 2020. &#160;

In response to the oil market downturn &#160;

that 

began in early 2020, &#160;

we announced the following capital, share repurchase &#160;

and operating cost reductions. We 

reduced our 2020 operating plan capital expenditures &#160;

by a total of $2.3 billion, or approximately &#160;

thirty-five 

percent of the original guidance. &#160;

We suspended our share repurchase program, further reducing cash outlays 

by approximately $2 billion. &#160;

We also reduced our operating costs by approximately $0.6 billion, &#160;

or roughly 

ten percent of the original 2020 guidance. &#160;

Collectively, these actions represent a reduction in 2020 cash uses of 

approximately $5 billion versus the original operating &#160;

plan. &#160;

&#160;

Considering the weakness in oil prices during the &#160;

second quarter of 2020, we established a framework &#160;

for 

evaluating and implementing economic curtailments, &#160;

which resulted in taking an additional significant &#160;

step of 

curtailing production, predominantly from &#160;

operated North American assets. &#160;

Due to our strong balance sheet, 

we were in an advantaged position to forgo some production &#160;

and cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher 

cash flows for those volumes in the future. &#160;

Based on our economic criteria, we began &#160;

restoring production 

from voluntary curtailments in July, and with oil prices stabilizing around $40 per &#160;

barrel, we ended our 

curtailment program by the end of the third quarter. &#160;

&#160;

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed &#160;

share repurchases, repurchasing $0.2 billion &#160;

of shares in October, 

before suspending our share repurchase program &#160;

upon entry into a definitive agreement to &#160;

acquire Concho. &#160;

We resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our Concho &#160;

acquisition. &#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2020, &#160;

we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion, &#160;

short-term investments of $3.6 

billion, and available borrowing capacity under &#160;

our credit facility of $5.7 billion, totaling &#160;

over $12 billion of 

liquidity. &#160;

We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external 

sources of funds as described below in the &#8220;Significant &#160;

Changes in Capital&#8221; section, will be sufficient &#160;

to meet 

our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including &#160;

our capital spending program, dividend 

payments and required debt payments. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Significant Changes in Capital 

&#160;

Operating Activities 

During 2020, cash provided by operating activities &#160;

was $4,802 million, a 57 percent decrease from 2019. &#160;

The 

decrease was primarily due to lower realized &#160;

commodity prices, normal field decline, &#160;

production curtailments, 

the divestiture of our U.K. &#160;

and Australia-West assets, and the absence in 2020 of collections under our 

settlement agreement with PDVSA, &#160;

partially offset by lower production and operating &#160;

expenses. &#160;

&#160;

Our short- &#160;

and long-term operating cash flows are highly &#160;

dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural 

gas, LNG and NGLs. &#160;

Prices and margins in our industry have historically &#160;

been volatile and are driven by 

market conditions over which we have no control. &#160;

Absent other mitigating factors, as these &#160;

prices and margins 

fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding &#160;

change in our operating cash flows. 

&#160;

The level of absolute production volumes, as &#160;

well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. &#160;

Full-

year production averaged 1,127 MBOED in 2020. &#160;

Full-year production excluding Libya averaged &#160;

1,118 

MBOED in 2020. &#160;

Adjusting for estimated curtailments of approximately &#160;

80 MBOED; &#160;

closed acquisitions and 

dispositions; &#160;

and excluding Libya; production for 2020 was 1,176 MBOED. &#160;

Production in 2021 is expected to 

be approximately 1.5 MMBOED, reflecting the &#160;

impact from the Concho acquisition. &#160;

Future production is 

subject to numerous uncertainties, including, &#160;

among others, the volatile crude oil and &#160;

natural gas price 

environment, which may impact investment decisions; &#160;

the effects of price changes on production sharing &#160;

and 

variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition &#160;

of fields; field production decline rates; new 

technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups &#160;

and major turnarounds; political instability; &#160;

weather-

related disruptions; and the addition of proved &#160;

reserves through exploratory success and &#160;

their timely and cost-

effective development. &#160;

While we actively manage these factors, &#160;

production levels can cause variability in cash 

flows, although generally this variability &#160;

has not been as significant as that caused by commodity &#160;

prices. 

&#160;

To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue &#160;

to add to our proved 

reserve base. &#160;

Our proved reserves generally increase as prices &#160;

rise and decrease as prices decline. &#160;

Reserve 

replacement represents the net change in proved &#160;

reserves, net of production, divided by our current &#160;

year 

production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table &#160;

disclosures. &#160;

Our reserve replacement was negative 86 

percent in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower &#160;

prices, which reduced reserves by approximately &#160;

600 MMBOE. &#160;

Our organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net &#160;

decrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases, &#160;

was 

negative 84 percent in 2020. &#160;

&#160;

In the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve &#160;

replacement was 59 percent, reflecting the impact &#160;

of 

lower prices in 2020. &#160;

Our organic reserve replacement during the three years &#160;

ended December 31, 2020, 

which excluded a net increase of 89 MMBOE related &#160;

to sales and purchases, was 53 percent. 

&#160;

For additional information about our 2021 capital &#160;

budget, see the &#8220;2021 Capital Budget&#8221; section &#160;

within 

&#8220;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; and for additional &#160;

information on proved reserves, including both 

developed and undeveloped reserves, see the &#8220;Oil &#160;

and Gas Operations&#8221; section of this report. 

&#160;

As discussed in the &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; &#160;

section, engineering estimates of proved &#160;

reserves are 

imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised &#160;

upward or downward due to the impact of changes &#160;

in 

commodity prices or as more technical data becomes &#160;

available on reservoirs. &#160;

It is not possible to reliably 

predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities &#160;

in the future. 

&#160;

Investing Activities 

In 2020, we invested $4.7 billion in capital &#160;

expenditures, of which $0.5 billion consisted of &#160;

strategic 

acquisitions, including additional Montney acreage. &#160;

Capital expenditures invested in 2019 and 2018 &#160;

were $6.6 

billion and $6.8 billion, &#160;

respectively. &#160;

For information about our capital expenditures &#160;

and investments, see the 

&#8220;Capital Expenditures and Investments&#8221; &#160;

section. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is 

to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide &#160;

yield and total returns; &#160;

these investments include time 

deposits, commercial paper as well as debt securities &#160;

classified as available for sale. &#160;

Funds for short-term 

needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency &#160;

to react to short-term price volatility are invested &#160;

in 

highly liquid instruments with maturities within &#160;

the year. &#160;

Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency 

in longer term price downturns and to capture &#160;

opportunities outside a given operating &#160;

plan may be invested in 

instruments with maturities greater than one year. &#160;

For additional information, see Note 1&#8211;Accounting &#160;

Policies 

and Note 13&#8211;Derivative and Financial Instruments, &#160;

Statements. 

&#160;

Investing activities in 2020 included net purchases &#160;

of $658 million of investments, &#160;

of which $420 million was 

invested in short-term instruments and $238 million &#160;

was invested in long-term instruments. &#160;

Investing 

activities in 2019 included net purchases of $2.9 &#160;

billion of investments, &#160;

of which $2.8 billion was invested in 

short-term instruments and $0.1 billion was invested &#160;

in long-term instruments. &#160;

&#160;

Proceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3 billion. &#160;

We received cash proceeds of $765 million for the 

divestiture of our Australia-West assets and operations, &#160;

with another $200 million payment due upon final 

investment decision of the proposed Barossa &#160;

development project. &#160;

We also received proceeds of $359 million 

and $184 million for the sale of our Niobrara interests &#160;

and Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48, 

respectively. &#160;

&#160;

Proceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion, &#160;

including $2.2 billion for the sale of &#160;

two ConocoPhillips 

U.K. subsidiaries and $350 million for &#160;

the sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater &#160;

Sunrise Fields. 

Proceeds from assets sales in 2018 were $1.1 &#160;

billion, including several non-core assets in &#160;

the Lower 48, as 

well as the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary &#160;

which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest &#160;

in the Clair 

Field in the U.K. &#160;

For additional information on our dispositions, &#160;

see Note 4&#8212;Asset Acquisitions and 

Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements. 

&#160;

Financing Activities 

We have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in May 2023. &#160;

Our revolving credit facility 

may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance &#160;

of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as 

support for our commercial paper program. &#160;

The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated &#160;

among financial 

institutions and does not contain any material &#160;

adverse change provisions or any covenants &#160;

requiring 

maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit &#160;

ratings. &#160;

The facility agreement contains a cross-default 

provision relating to the failure to pay principal or &#160;

interest on other debt obligations of &#160;

$200 million or more 

by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. &#160;

The amount of the facility is not subject to &#160;

the 

redetermination prior to its expiration date. 

&#160;

Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at &#160;

a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the 

London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight &#160;

federal funds rate or prime rates offered by 

certain designated banks in the U.S. &#160;

The agreement calls for commitment fees &#160;

on available, but unused, 

amounts. &#160;

The agreement also contains early termination &#160;

rights if our current directors or their approved 

successors cease to be a majority of the Board &#160;

of Directors. 

&#160;

The revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips &#160;

Company&#8217;s ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of 

commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term &#160;

working capital needs. &#160;

Commercial 

paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. &#160;

With $300 million of commercial paper outstanding and no 

direct borrowings or letters of credit, &#160;

we had $5.7 billion in available borrowing capacity &#160;

under the revolving 

credit facility at December 31, 2020. &#160;

We may consider issuing additional commercial paper in the future to 

supplement our cash position. 

&#160;

In October 2020, Moody&#8217;s affirmed its rating of our senior long-term debt of &#8220;A3&#8221; &#160;

with a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook, and 

affirmed its rating of our short-term debt as &#8220;Prime-2.&#8221; &#160;

In January 2021, Fitch affirmed its rating of our long-

term debt as &#8220;A&#8221; with a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook and affirmed its &#160;

rating of our short-term debt as &#8220;F1+.&#8221; &#160;

On January 

25, 2021, S&#38;P revised the industry risk assessment &#160;

for the E&#38;P industry to &#8216;Moderately High&#8217; from 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8216;Intermediate&#8217; based on a view of increasing &#160;

risks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker 

profitability. &#160;

On February 11, 2021, S&#38;P downgraded its rating of our long-term debt &#160;

from &#8220;A&#8221; to &#8220;A-&#8221; with a 

&#8220;stable&#8221; outlook and downgraded its rating of our short-term &#160;

debt from &#8220;A-1&#8221; to &#8220;A-2.&#8221; &#160;

We do not have any 

ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt &#160;

that would cause an automatic default, and &#160;

thereby impact our 

access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings. &#160;

If our credit ratings &#160;

are downgraded from their 

current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate &#160;

debt available to us and restrict our access to &#160;

the 

commercial paper markets. &#160;

If our credit rating were to deteriorate &#160;

to a level prohibiting us from accessing the 

commercial paper market, we would still &#160;

be able to access funds under our revolving credit &#160;

facility. &#160;

&#160;

Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial &#160;

contracts and derivative instruments contain &#160;

provisions 

requiring us to post collateral. &#160;

Many of these contracts and instruments permit &#160;

us to post either cash or letters 

of credit as collateral. &#160;

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had direct &#160;

bank letters of credit of $249 million 

and $277 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to &#160;

various purchase 

commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of &#160;

business. &#160;

In the event of credit &#160;

ratings downgrades, we may 

be required to post additional letters of &#160;

credit.

&#160;

&#160;

On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition &#160;

of Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition, 

we assumed Concho&#8217;s publicly traded debt. &#160;

On December 7, 2020, we launched an offer to exchange 

Concho&#8217;s publicly traded debt for debt issued by ConocoPhillips. &#160;

The exchange offer settled on February 8, 

2021. &#160;

Of the approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate &#160;

principal amount of Concho&#8217;s notes subject to the 

exchange offer, 98 percent, or approximately $3.8 billion, was tendered and &#160;

exchanged for new debt issued by 

ConocoPhillips. &#160;

There were no impacts to ConocoPhillips&#8217; &#160;

credit ratings as a result of the debt exchange. &#160;

For 

additional information, &#160;

see Note 10&#8212;Debt and Note 25&#8212;Acquisition &#160;

of Concho Resources Inc., in the Notes 

to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

&#160;

Shelf Registration 

We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which &#160;

we have the ability to issue 

and sell an indeterminate amount of various types &#160;

of debt and equity securities. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Guarantor Summarized Financial Information 

&#160;

We have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company &#160;

and Burlington Resources 

LLC, with respect to publicly held debt securities. &#160;

ConocoPhillips Company is 100 percent &#160;

owned by 

ConocoPhillips. &#160;

Burlington Resources LLC is 100 percent &#160;

owned by ConocoPhillips Company. &#160;

ConocoPhillips and/or ConocoPhillips Company &#160;

have fully and unconditionally guaranteed &#160;

the payment 

obligations of Burlington Resources LLC, with respect &#160;

to its publicly held debt securities. &#160;

Similarly, 

ConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally &#160;

guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips &#160;

Company 

with respect to its publicly held debt securities. &#160;

In addition, ConocoPhillips Company &#160;

has fully and 

unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations &#160;

of ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly &#160;

held debt 

securities. &#160;

All guarantees are joint and several. &#160;

&#160;

In March of 2020, the SEC adopted amendments &#160;

to simplify the financial disclosure requirements &#160;

for 

guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities &#160;

registered under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. &#160;

Based on our 

evaluation of our existing guarantee relationships, &#160;

we qualify for the transition to alternative disclosures. &#160;

We 

elected early voluntary compliance with the final &#160;

amendments beginning in the third quarter &#160;

of 2020. &#160;

Accordingly, condensed consolidating information by guarantor and issuer of &#160;

guaranteed securities will no 

longer be reported, and alternative disclosures &#160;

of summarized financial information for the &#160;

consolidated 

Obligor Group is presented. &#160;

The following tables present summarized financial &#160;

information for the Obligor

&#160;

Our debt balance at December 31, 2020, was $15,369 &#160;

million, an increase of $474 million from &#160;

the balance at 

December 31, 2019. &#160;

Maturities of debt (including payments for &#160;

finance leases) due in 2021 of $601 million, 

excluding net unamortized premiums and discounts, &#160;

will be paid from current cash balances and cash 

generated by operations. &#160;

For more information on Debt, see Note 10&#8212;Debt, &#160;

in the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. 

&#160;

We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing and sustainable dividend &#160;

supplemented by 

additional returns of capital, including share repurchases. &#160;

In 2020, we paid $1,831 million, $1.69 per share of 

common stock, in dividends. This is an increase &#160;

over 2019 and 2018, when we paid $1.34 and &#160;

$1.16 per share 

of common stock, respectively. &#160;

In February 2021, we announced a quarterly dividend &#160;

of $0.43 per share, 

payable March 1, 2021, to stockholders of record &#160;

at the close of business on February 12, 2021. 

&#160;

In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase &#160;

program, which has a current total program 

authorization of $25 billion of our common stock. &#160;

Cost of share repurchases were $892 million, &#160;

$3,500 

million and $2,999 million in 2020, 2019 and &#160;

2018, &#160;

respectively. &#160;

Share repurchases since inception of our 

current program totaled 189 &#160;

million shares at a cost of $10,517 million, as of &#160;

December 31, 2020. &#160;

In the 

fourth quarter of 2020, we suspended share repurchases &#160;

upon entry into a definitive agreement &#160;

to acquire 

Concho. &#160;

We resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after the completion of our Concho acquisition. &#160;

Repurchases are made at management&#8217;s discretion, at prevailing prices, &#160;

subject to market conditions and other 

factors.

&#160;

Our dividend and share repurchase programs are &#160;

subject to numerous considerations, including &#160;

market 

conditions, management discretion and other factors. &#160;

See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors 

&#8211; 

Our ability to declare and 

pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to &#160;

certain considerations.&#8221; &#160;

&#160;

In addition to the requirements above, we have contractual &#160;

obligations for the purchase of goods and services 

of approximately $8,123 million. &#160;

We expect to fulfill $2,805 million of these obligations in 2021. These 

figures exclude purchase commitments &#160;

for jointly owned fields and facilities where &#160;

we are not the operator. &#160;

Purchase obligations of $5,237 million &#160;

are related to agreements to access and utilize &#160;

the capacity of third-

party equipment and facilities, including pipelines &#160;

and LNG product terminals, to transport, process, &#160;

treat and 

store commodities. &#160;

Purchase obligations of $2,290 million are related &#160;

to market-based contracts for 

commodity product purchases with third parties. &#160;

The remainder is primarily our net share &#160;

of purchase 

commitments for materials and services for jointly &#160;

owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. &#160;

2021 CAPITAL BUDGET 

&#160;

In February 2021, we announced 2021 operating &#160;

plan capital for the combined company of $5.5 &#160;

billion. &#160;

The 

plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current &#160;

production and $0.4 billion for investment &#160;

in major projects, 

primarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration &#160;

appraisal activity. 

&#160;

The operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion &#160;

is expected to deliver production from the combined &#160;

company 

of approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021. &#160;

This production guidance excludes Libya. 

&#160;

For information on PUDs and the associated costs &#160;

to develop these reserves, see the &#8220;Oil and Gas &#160;

Operations&#8221; 

section in this report. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Contingencies 

A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims &#160;

arising in the ordinary course of business &#160;

have been filed 

against ConocoPhillips. &#160;

We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the 

placement, storage, disposal or release of certain &#160;

chemical, mineral and petroleum substances &#160;

at various active 

and inactive sites. &#160;

We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these 

contingencies. &#160;

In the case of all known contingencies (other &#160;

than those related to income taxes), we accrue &#160;

a 

liability when the loss is probable and the amount &#160;

is reasonably estimable. &#160;

If a range of amounts can be 

reasonably estimated and no amount within the range &#160;

is a better estimate than any other amount, &#160;

then the low 

end of the range is accrued. &#160;

We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. &#160;

We accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries when applicable. &#160;

With respect to income 

tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted &#160;

loss accrual in cases where sustaining a 

tax position is less than certain. 

&#160;

Based on currently available information, we believe &#160;

it is remote that future costs related to known &#160;

contingent 

liability exposures will exceed current accruals by &#160;

an amount that would have a material &#160;

adverse impact on our 

consolidated financial statements. &#160;

For information on other contingencies, see &#160;

&#8220;Critical Accounting 

Estimates&#8221; and Note 12&#8212;Contingencies and &#160;

Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated &#160;

Financial Statements. &#160;

&#160;

Legal and Tax Matters 

We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters &#160;

involving oil and gas royalty 

and severance tax payments, gas measurement and &#160;

valuation methods, contract disputes, &#160;

environmental 

damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage. &#160;

Our primary exposures for such matters 

relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments &#160;

on certain federal, state and privately owned &#160;

properties and 

claims of alleged environmental contamination &#160;

from historic operations. &#160;

We will continue to defend ourselves 

vigorously in these matters. 

&#160;

Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience &#160;

and professional judgment to the specific 

characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation &#160;

management process to manage and monitor the &#160;

legal 

proceedings against us. &#160;

Our process facilitates the early evaluation and &#160;

quantification of potential exposures in 

individual cases. &#160;

This process also enables us to track those cases that &#160;

have been scheduled for trial and/or 

mediation. &#160;

Based on professional judgment and experience &#160;

in using these litigation management tools and 

available information about current developments &#160;

in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses &#160;

the 

adequacy of current accruals and determines if &#160;

adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment &#160;

of new 

accruals, is required. &#160;

See Note 18&#8212;Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, &#160;

for 

additional information about income tax-related &#160;

contingencies. 

&#160;

Environmental 

We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental &#160;

laws and regulations 

as other companies in our industry. &#160;

The most significant of these environmental &#160;

laws and regulations include, 

among others, the: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs &#160;

air emissions. 

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. 

&#9679;

&#160;

European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, &#160;

Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals 

(REACH). 

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental &#160;

Response, Compensation and Liability Act &#160;

(CERCLA or 

Superfund), which imposes liability on generators, &#160;

transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances 

at sites where hazardous substance releases have &#160;

occurred or are threatening to occur. 

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery &#160;

Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, &#160;

storage 

and disposal of solid waste. 

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators &#160;

of onshore 

facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees &#160;

of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and 

owners and operators of vessels are liable for &#160;

removal costs and damages that result from &#160;

a discharge 

of oil into navigable waters of the U.S. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know &#160;

Act (EPCRA), which requires 

facilities to report toxic chemical inventories &#160;

with local emergency planning committees and response 

departments. 

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater &#160;

in underground 

injection wells. 

&#9679;

&#160;

U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, &#160;

which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. 

waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution &#160;

cleanup resulting from operations, as well as 

potential liability for pollution damages. 

&#9679;

&#160;

European Union Trading Directive resulting in European &#160;

Emissions Trading Scheme. 

&#160;

These laws and their implementing regulations &#160;

set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to &#160;

water, 

establish water quality limits and establish standards &#160;

and impose obligations for the remediation &#160;

of releases of 

hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. &#160;

They also, in most cases, require permits in &#160;

association with new 

or modified operations. &#160;

These permits can require an applicant to &#160;

collect substantial information in connection 

with the application process, which can be expensive &#160;

and time consuming. &#160;

In addition, there can be delays 

associated with notice and comment periods and &#160;

the agency&#8217;s processing of the application. &#160;

Many of the 

delays associated with the permitting process &#160;

are beyond the control of the applicant. 

&#160;

Many states and foreign countries where &#160;

we operate also have, or are developing, similar &#160;

environmental laws 

and regulations governing these same types of &#160;

activities. &#160;

While similar, in some cases these regulations may 

impose additional, or more stringent, requirements &#160;

that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing &#160;

or 

transporting products across state and international &#160;

borders. 

&#160;

The ultimate financial impact arising from &#160;

environmental laws and regulations is neither &#160;

clearly known nor 

easily determinable as new standards, such as &#160;

air emission standards and water quality standards, &#160;

continue to 

evolve. &#160;

However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that &#160;

may arise to address concerns 

about global climate change, are expected to continue &#160;

to have an increasing impact on our operations &#160;

in the 

U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. &#160;

Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission 

compliance and remediation obligations in &#160;

the U.S. and Canada. 

&#160;

An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, &#160;

an essential completion technique that facilitates &#160;

production of 

oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower &#160;

permeability rock formations. &#160;

A range of local, state, federal or 

national laws and regulations currently govern &#160;

hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic &#160;

fracturing 

currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. &#160;

Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted &#160;

for many 

decades, a number of new laws, regulations &#160;

and permitting requirements are under consideration &#160;

by various 

state environmental agencies, and others which &#160;

could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, 

operational delays and/or limit the ability &#160;

to develop oil and natural gas resources. &#160;

Governmental restrictions 

on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall &#160;

profitability or viability of certain of our oil &#160;

and natural gas 

investments. &#160;

We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards &#160;

designed to 

meet or exceed government requirements. &#160;

Our practices continually evolve as technology &#160;

improves and 

regulations change. &#160;

&#160;

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation &#160;

obligations 

associated with current and past operations. &#160;

Such laws and regulations include CERCLA &#160;

and RCRA and their 

state equivalents. &#160;

Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable &#160;

uncertainty and may fluctuate 

significantly. 

&#160;

We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability &#160;

from the EPA and state 

environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially &#160;

responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent &#160;

state 

statute. &#160;

On occasion, we also have been made a party &#160;

to cost recovery litigation by those agencies &#160;

or by 

private parties. &#160;

These requests, notices and lawsuits assert &#160;

potential liability for remediation costs at various 

sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly &#160;

contain wastes attributable to our past operations. &#160;

As of 

December 31, 2020, there were 15 sites around &#160;

the U.S. in which we were identified as &#160;

a potentially 

responsible party under CERCLA and comparable &#160;

state laws. 

&#160;

&#160;

For most Superfund sites, our potential liability &#160;

will be significantly less than the total site &#160;

remediation costs 

because the percentage of waste attributable &#160;

to us, versus that attributable to all other &#160;

potentially responsible 

parties, is relatively low. &#160;

Although liability of those potentially &#160;

responsible is generally joint and several for 

federal sites and frequently so for state sites, &#160;

other potentially responsible parties at sites &#160;

where we are a party 

typically have had the financial strength to &#160;

meet their obligations, and where they have &#160;

not, or where 

potentially responsible parties could not be located, &#160;

our share of liability has not increased materially. &#160;

Many of 

the sites at which we are potentially responsible &#160;

are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies 

concerned. &#160;

Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible &#160;

normally assess site conditions, apportion 

responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. &#160;

In some instances, we may have no liability &#160;

or attain 

a settlement of liability. &#160;

Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties &#160;

obtain EPA or equivalent state 

agency approval. &#160;

There are relatively few sites where we &#160;

are a major participant, and given the timing &#160;

and 

amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the &#160;

cost of remediation at those sites nor &#160;

such costs at all 

CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to &#160;

have a material adverse effect on our competitive &#160;

or financial 

condition. 

&#160;

Expensed environmental costs were $393 million &#160;

in 2020 and are expected to be about $435 million &#160;

per year 

in 2021 and 2022. &#160;

Capitalized environmental costs were $161 million &#160;

in 2020 and are expected to be about 

$210 million per year in 2021 and 2022. 

&#160;

Accrued liabilities for remediation activities &#160;

are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers &#160;

or other 

third parties and are not discounted (except those &#160;

assumed in a purchase business combination, &#160;

which we do 

record on a discounted basis). 

&#160;

Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, &#160;

RCRA and similar state or international laws that &#160;

require us to 

undertake certain investigative and remedial &#160;

activities at sites where we conduct, or once &#160;

conducted, 

operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated &#160;

waste was disposed. &#160;

The accrual also includes a number 

of sites we identified that may require environmental &#160;

remediation, but which are not currently the &#160;

subject of 

CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement &#160;

activities. &#160;

The laws that require or address environmental 

remediation may apply retroactively and regardless &#160;

of fault, the legality of the original activities &#160;

or the current 

ownership or control of sites. &#160;

If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable &#160;

insurance or other third-party 

recoveries. &#160;

In the future, we may incur significant costs &#160;

under both CERCLA and RCRA. &#160;

&#160;

Remediation activities vary substantially &#160;

in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the &#160;

mix of unique 

site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, &#160;

diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement &#160;

policies, 

and the presence or absence of potentially liable &#160;

third parties. &#160;

Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable 

estimates of future site remediation costs. 

&#160;

At December 31, 2020, our balance sheet included &#160;

total accrued environmental costs of &#160;

$180 million, 

compared with $171 million at December 31, &#160;

2019, for remediation activities in the &#160;

U.S. and Canada. &#160;

We 

expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures &#160;

within the next 30 years. &#160;

&#160;

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as &#160;

with other companies engaged in similar businesses, 

environmental costs and liabilities are inherent &#160;

concerns in our operations and products, and there &#160;

can be no 

assurance that material costs and liabilities &#160;

will not be incurred. &#160;

However, we currently do not expect any 

material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial &#160;

position as a result of compliance with 

current environmental laws and regulations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Climate Change 

Continuing political and social attention to the &#160;

issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad &#160;

range of 

proposed or promulgated state, national and international &#160;

laws focusing on GHG reduction. &#160;

These proposed or 

promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries &#160;

where we have interests or may have interests &#160;

in the future. &#160;

Laws in this field continue to evolve, and &#160;

while it is not possible to accurately estimate either &#160;

a timetable for 

implementation or our future compliance costs &#160;

relating to implementation, such laws, if &#160;

enacted, could have a 

material impact on our results of operations and &#160;

financial condition. &#160;

Examples of legislation and precursors 

for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations &#160;

include: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through &#160;

which many of the EU member 

states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. &#160;

Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in &#160;

2020 was 

approximately $7 million before-tax. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation &#160;

requires any existing 

facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 &#160;

metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, 

per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity. &#160;

The total cost of these regulations in 2020 &#160;

was 

approximately $2 million. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts &#160;

v. EPA &#160;

, &#160;

549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), 

confirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an &#8220;air pollutant&#8221; &#160;

under the 

Federal Clean Air Act. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The U.S. EPA&#8217;s &#160;

announcement on March 29, 2010 (published &#160;

as &#8220;Interpretation of Regulations that 

Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act &#160;

Permitting Programs,&#8221; 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April &#160;

2, 

2010)), and the EPA&#8217;s &#160;

and U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on 

April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs &#160;

under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more &#160;

climate-

based claims for damages, and may result in longer &#160;

agency review time for development projects. &#160;

The U.S. EPA&#8217;s &#160;

announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining &#160;

a series of steps it plans to take to 

address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound &#160;

emissions from the oil and gas 

industry. &#160;

The U.S. government established a goal of &#160;

reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions 

from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent &#160;

by 2025. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. &#160;

Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon &#160;

tax legislation 

in 2020 was approximately $29 million (net &#160;

share before-tax). &#160;

We also incur a carbon tax for 

emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our &#160;

British Columbia and Alberta operations in &#160;

Canada, 

totaling approximately $3.5 million (net share &#160;

before-tax). 

&#9679;

&#160;

The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 &#160;

at the 21

st

&#160;

Conference of the Parties to the United 

Nations Framework Convention on Climate &#160;

Change, setting out a process for achieving &#160;

global 

emission reductions. &#160;

The new administration has recommitted &#160;

the United States to the Paris 

Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state &#160;

and local governments and major corporations 

headquartered in the U.S. have also announced &#160;

related commitments. 

&#160;

In the U.S., some additional form of regulation &#160;

may be forthcoming in the future at the &#160;

federal and state levels 

with respect to GHG emissions. &#160;

Such regulation could take any of several &#160;

forms that may result in the creation 

of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction &#160;

of output, investments of capital to maintain &#160;

compliance 

with laws and regulations, or required acquisition &#160;

or trading of emission allowances. &#160;

We are working to 

continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through &#160;

resource and energy conservation throughout 

our operations. 

&#160;

Compliance with changes in laws and regulations &#160;

that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme &#160;

or GHG 

reduction policies could significantly increase &#160;

our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived &#160;

products, 

impact the cost and availability of capital &#160;

and increase our exposure to litigation. &#160;

Such laws and regulations 

could also increase demand for less carbon intensive &#160;

energy sources, including natural gas. &#160;

The ultimate 

impact on our financial performance, either positive &#160;

or negative, will depend on a number of factors, &#160;

including 

but not limited to: &#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Whether and to what extent legislation or &#160;

regulation is enacted. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The timing of the introduction of such legislation &#160;

or regulation. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and &#160;

trade system or a tax on emissions) or &#160;

regulation. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The price placed on GHG emissions (either &#160;

by the market or through a tax). 

&#9679;

&#160;

The GHG reductions required. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

The price and availability of offsets. 

&#9679;

&#160;

The amount and allocation of allowances. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Any potential significant physical effects of climate &#160;

change (such as increased severe weather events, 

changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are &#160;

ultimately reflected in the prices of 

our products and services. &#160;

&#160;

Climate Change Litigation

&#160;

Beginning in 2017, governmental and other entities &#160;

in several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits &#160;

against oil 

and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, &#160;

seeking compensatory damages and equitable &#160;

relief to abate 

alleged climate change impacts. &#160;

Additional lawsuits with similar allegations &#160;

are expected to be filed. &#160;

The 

amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal &#160;

and factual issues involved in these cases are 

unprecedented. &#160;

ConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are &#160;

factually and legally meritless and are an 

inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges &#160;

associated with climate change and will &#160;

vigorously defend 

against such lawsuits. 

&#160;

Several Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana &#160;

have filed 43 lawsuits under Louisiana&#8217;s State and Local 

Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA) &#160;

against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, 

seeking compensatory damages for contamination &#160;

and erosion of the Louisiana coastline &#160;

allegedly caused by 

historical oil and gas operations. &#160;

ConocoPhillips entities are defendants &#160;

in 22 of the lawsuits and will 

vigorously defend against them. &#160;

Because Plaintiffs&#8217; SLCRMA theories are unprecedented, &#160;

there is uncertainty 

about these claims (both as to scope and damages) &#160;

and any potential financial impact on the company. 

&#160;

Company Response to Climate-Related Risks 

The company has responded by putting in place &#160;

a Sustainable Development Risk Management Standard 

covering the assessment and registering of significant &#160;

and high sustainable development risks based &#160;

on their 

consequence and likelihood of occurrence. &#160;

We have developed a company-wide Climate Change Action Plan 

with the goal of tracking mitigation activities &#160;

for each climate-related risk included in the corporate 

Sustainable Development Risk Register. 

&#160;

The risks addressed in our Climate Change Action &#160;

Plan fall into four broad categories: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

GHG-related legislation and regulation. 

&#9679;

&#160;

GHG emissions management. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Physical climate-related impacts. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Climate-related disclosure and reporting. 

&#160;

Emissions are categorized into three different scopes. &#160;

Gross operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 

help us understand our climate transition &#160;

risk. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions &#160;

from sources that we own or control. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Scope 2 emissions are GHG emissions from &#160;

the generation of purchased electricity or &#160;

steam that we 

consume. &#160;

&#160;

Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions &#160;

from sources that we neither own nor control. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We announced in October 2020 the adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework &#160;

with the objective of 

implementing a coherent set of choices designed &#160;

to facilitate the success of our existing exploration &#160;

and 

production business through the energy transition. &#160;

Given the uncertainties remaining about how the &#160;

energy 

transition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust &#160;

across a range of potential future outcomes. &#160;

&#160;

The strategy is comprised of four pillars: 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Targets: &#160;

Our target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term &#160;

ambition that sets 

the direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for GHG emissions 

intensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions. These &#160;

performance 

targets are supported by lower-level internal business &#160;

unit goals to enable the company to achieve the 

company-wide targets. &#160;

We have set a target to reduce our gross operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions 

intensity by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by &#160;

2030, with an ambition to achieve net-zero &#160;

operated 

emissions by 2050. &#160;

We have joined the World &#160;

Bank Flaring Initiative to work towards &#160;

zero routine 

flaring of gas by 2030. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Technology choices: &#160;

We expanded our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve process to provide a broader 

range of opportunities for emission reduction &#160;

technology. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Portfolio choices: &#160;

Our corporate authorization process requires &#160;

all qualifying projects to include a 

GHG price in their project approval economics. &#160;

Different GHG prices are used depending on the 

region or jurisdiction. &#160;

Projects in jurisdictions with existing GHG &#160;

pricing regimes incorporate the 

existing GHG price and forecast into their &#160;

economics. &#160;

Projects where no existing GHG pricing 

regime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our &#160;

internally consistent World Energy Model. &#160;

In this 

way, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making. &#160;

The 

company does not use an estimated market cost &#160;

of GHG emissions when assessing reserves &#160;

in 

jurisdictions without existing GHG regulations. 

&#9679;

&#160;

External engagement: Our external engagement &#160;

aims to differentiate ConocoPhillips within the oil and 

gas sector with our approach to managing climate-related &#160;

risk. &#160;

We are a Founding Member of the 

Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international &#160;

policy institute founded in collaboration &#160;

with 

business and environmental interests to develop &#160;

a carbon dividend plan. &#160;

Participation in the CLC 

provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue &#160;

about carbon pricing and framing the issues &#160;

in 

alignment with our public policy principles. &#160;

We also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon 

Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of &#160;

the CLC. 

&#160;

&#160;

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

&#160;

The preparation of financial statements &#160;

in conformity with GAAP requires management &#160;

to select appropriate 

accounting policies and to make estimates and &#160;

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, 

liabilities, revenues and expenses. &#160;

See Note 1&#8212;Accounting Policies, in the Notes &#160;

to Consolidated Financial 

Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting &#160;

policies. &#160;

Certain of these accounting policies involve 

judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there &#160;

is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts 

would have been reported under different conditions, or if &#160;

different assumptions had been used. &#160;

These critical 

accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit &#160;

and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at &#160;

least 

annually. &#160;

We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along &#160;

with the discussion of 

deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this &#160;

report, address all important accounting &#160;

areas where the nature 

of accounting estimates or assumptions is material &#160;

due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary &#160;

to 

account for highly uncertain matters or the &#160;

susceptibility of such matters to change. 

&#160;

Oil and Gas Accounting 

&#160;

Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity &#160;

is subject to special accounting rules unique &#160;

to the oil and gas 

industry. &#160;

The acquisition of G&#38;G seismic information, &#160;

prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is &#160;

expensed 

as incurred, similar to accounting for research and &#160;

development costs. &#160;

However, leasehold acquisition costs 

and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the &#160;

balance sheet pending determination of whether &#160;

proved oil 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

and gas reserves have been recognized. 

&#160;

Property Acquisition Costs 

For individually significant leaseholds, management &#160;

periodically assesses for impairment based on &#160;

exploration 

and drilling efforts to date. &#160;

For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition &#160;

costs, management exercises 

judgment and determines a percentage probability &#160;

that the prospect ultimately will fail to find &#160;

proved oil and 

gas reserves and pools that leasehold information &#160;

with others in the geographic area. &#160;

For prospects in areas 

with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, &#160;

the percentage probability of ultimate failure &#160;

is normally 

judged to be quite high. &#160;

This judgmental percentage is multiplied &#160;

by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that 

product is divided by the contractual period &#160;

of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold &#160;

impairment 

charge that is reported in exploration expense. &#160;

This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed &#160;

and 

adjusted throughout the contractual period of the &#160;

leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable &#160;

exploratory 

activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, &#160;

and leasehold impairment amortization expense is &#160;

adjusted 

prospectively. &#160;

&#160;

At year-end 2020, the remaining $2.4 billion of net capitalized &#160;

unproved property costs consisted primarily &#160;

of 

individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights &#160;

held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory &#160;

wells 

currently being drilled, suspended exploratory &#160;

wells, and capitalized interest. &#160;

Of this amount, approximately 

$1.9 billion is concentrated in 10 major development &#160;

areas, the majority of which are not expected to &#160;

move to 

proved properties in 2021. &#160;

Management periodically assesses individually &#160;

significant leaseholds for 

impairment based on the results of exploration &#160;

and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. 

&#160;

Exploratory Costs 

For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily &#160;

capitalized, or &#8220;suspended,&#8221; on the balance sheet, &#160;

pending 

a determination of whether potentially economic &#160;

oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the &#160;

drilling 

effort to justify development. &#160;

&#160;

If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic &#160;

quantities of oil and gas, the well costs &#160;

remain capitalized 

on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing &#160;

the reserves and the economic and operating 

viability of the project is being made. &#160;

The accounting notion of &#8220;sufficient progress&#8221; is &#160;

a judgmental area, but 

the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization &#160;

of suspended well costs on the expectation &#160;

future 

market conditions will improve or new technologies &#160;

will be found that would make the development 

economically profitable. &#160;

Often, the ability to move into the development &#160;

phase and record proved reserves is 

dependent on obtaining permits and government &#160;

or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is &#160;

ultimately 

beyond our control. &#160;

Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long &#160;

as we are actively pursuing such 

approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. &#160;

Once all required approvals and permits have &#160;

been 

obtained, the projects are moved into the development &#160;

phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated &#160;

as 

proved reserves. &#160;

For complex exploratory discoveries, it &#160;

is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain 

suspended on the balance sheet for several &#160;

years while we perform additional appraisal &#160;

drilling and seismic 

work on the potential oil and gas field or while &#160;

we seek government or co-venturer approval of development 

plans or seek environmental permitting. &#160;

Once a determination is made the well did not &#160;

encounter potentially 

economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs &#160;

are expensed as a dry hole and reported in &#160;

exploration expense. &#160;

&#160;

Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors &#160;

the results of the additional 

appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses &#160;

the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it &#160;

determines 

the potential field does not warrant further &#160;

investment in the near term. &#160;

Criteria utilized in making this 

determination include evaluation of the reservoir &#160;

characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, &#160;

expected 

development costs, ability to apply existing technology &#160;

to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, &#160;

regulations or 

contract negotiations, and our expected return &#160;

on investment. 

&#160;

At year-end 2020, &#160;

total suspended well costs were $682 million, &#160;

compared with $1,020 million at year-end 

2019. &#160;

For additional information on suspended wells, &#160;

including an aging analysis, see Note 7&#8212;Suspended 

Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Proved Reserves 

&#160;

Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves &#160;

are inherently imprecise and represent only 

approximate amounts because of the judgments involved &#160;

in developing such information. &#160;

Reserve estimates 

are based on geological and engineering assessments &#160;

of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production &#160;

plan, 

historical extraction recovery and processing yield &#160;

factors, installed plant operating capacity &#160;

and approved 

operating limits. &#160;

The reliability of these estimates at any point &#160;

in time depends on both the quality and 

quantity of the technical and economic data &#160;

and the efficiency of extracting and processing the &#160;

hydrocarbons. &#160;

&#160;

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering &#160;

estimates, accounting rules require disclosure &#160;

of 

&#8220;proved&#8221; reserve estimates due to the importance &#160;

of these estimates to better understand the perceived &#160;

value 

and future cash flows of a company&#8217;s operations. &#160;

There are several authoritative guidelines &#160;

regarding the 

engineering criteria that must be met before estimated &#160;

reserves can be designated as &#8220;proved.&#8221; &#160;

Our 

geosciences and reservoir engineering organization &#160;

has policies and procedures in place consistent &#160;

with these 

authoritative guidelines. &#160;

We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate &#160;

our 

proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as &#160;

well as our share of equity affiliates. &#160;

&#160;

Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually &#160;

in the fourth quarter and during the year &#160;

if significant changes 

occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface &#160;

information about each field. &#160;

Also, as required 

by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated &#160;

future date when an asset will reach the end &#160;

of its economic 

life is based on 12-month average prices and current &#160;

costs. &#160;

This date estimates when production will end and 

affects the amount of estimated reserves. &#160;

Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from &#160;

year to year, the 

estimate of proved reserves also changes. &#160;

Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and 

increase as prices rise. 

&#160;

Our proved reserves include estimated quantities &#160;

related to PSCs, reported under the &#8220;economic interest&#8221; 

method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, &#160;

and are subject to fluctuations in commodity &#160;

prices; recoverable 

operating expenses; and capital costs. &#160;

If costs remain stable, reserve quantities &#160;

attributable to recovery of costs 

will change inversely to changes in commodity &#160;

prices. &#160;

We would expect reserves from these contracts to 

decrease when product prices rise and increase &#160;

when prices decline. &#160;

&#160;

The estimation of proved developed reserves also &#160;

is important to the income statement because &#160;

the proved 

developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the &#160;

denominator in the unit-of-production &#160;

calculation of the 

DD&#38;A of the capitalized costs for that asset. &#160;

At year-end 2020, the net book value of productive PP&#38;E 

subject to a unit-of-production calculation was &#160;

approximately $33 billion and the DD&#38;A recorded &#160;

on these 

assets in 2020 was approximately $5.3 billion. &#160;

The estimated proved developed reserves for &#160;

our consolidated 

operations were 3.2 billion BOE at the end &#160;

of 2019 and 2.5 billion BOE at the end of &#160;

2020. &#160;

If the estimates of 

proved reserves used in the unit-of-production &#160;

calculations had been lower by 10 percent &#160;

across all 

calculations, before-tax DD&#38;A in 2020 &#160;

would have increased by an estimated $588 &#160;

million. &#160;

&#160;

Impairments 

&#160;

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed &#160;

for impairment whenever changes in facts &#160;

and circumstances 

indicate a possible significant deterioration &#160;

in future cash flows expected to be generated &#160;

by an asset group. &#160;

If 

there is an indication the carrying amount of &#160;

an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability &#160;

test is performed 

using management&#8217;s assumptions for prices, volumes and future development &#160;

plans. &#160;

If, upon review, the sum 

of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes &#160;

is less than the carrying value of the asset &#160;

group, the 

carrying value is written down to estimated fair &#160;

value and reported as impairments in the &#160;

periods in which the 

determination is made. &#160;

Individual assets are grouped for impairment &#160;

purposes at the lowest level for which 

there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent &#160;

of the cash flows of other groups of assets&#8212;

generally on a field-by-field basis for E&#38;P assets. &#160;

Because there usually is a lack of quoted &#160;

market prices for 

long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets &#160;

is typically determined based on the present &#160;

values of 

expected future cash flows using discount rates &#160;

and prices believed to be consistent with &#160;

those used by 

principal market participants, &#160;

or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated &#160;

with historical market 

transactions of similar assets where possible. &#160;

The expected future cash flows used for &#160;

impairment reviews and 

related fair value calculations are based on estimated &#160;

future production volumes, commodity &#160;

prices, operating 

&#160;

costs and capital decisions, considering all &#160;

available information at the date of review. &#160;

Differing assumptions 

could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment &#160;

in any period. &#160;

See Note 8&#8212;Impairments, in the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, &#160;

for additional information. 

&#160;

Investments in nonconsolidated entities &#160;

accounted for under the equity method are assessed &#160;

for impairment 

whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate &#160;

a loss in value has occurred. &#160;

Such evidence of a loss 

in value might include our inability to &#160;

recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained &#160;

earnings capacity 

which would justify the current investment amount, &#160;

or a current fair value less than the investment&#8217;s carrying 

amount. &#160;

When such a condition is judgmentally determined &#160;

to be other than temporary, an impairment charge 

is recognized for the difference between the investment&#8217;s carrying value and its estimated &#160;

fair value. &#160;

When 

determining whether a decline in value is other than &#160;

temporary, management considers factors such as the 

length of time and extent of the decline, the investee&#8217;s financial condition &#160;

and near-term prospects, and our 

ability and intention to retain our investment for &#160;

a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated 

recovery in the market value of the investment. &#160;

Since quoted market prices are usually not &#160;

available, the fair 

value is typically based on the present value &#160;

of expected future cash flows using discount &#160;

rates and prices 

believed to be consistent with those used by principal &#160;

market participants, plus market analysis &#160;

of comparable 

assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. &#160;

Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of 

an impairment of an investment in any period. &#160;

See the &#8220;APLNG&#8221; section of Note 5&#8212;Investments, &#160;

Loans and 

Long-Term Receivables, &#160;

in the Notes to Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements, for additional information. 

&#160;

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs 

&#160;

Under various contracts, permits and regulations, &#160;

we have material legal obligations to remove &#160;

tangible 

equipment and restore the land or seabed at the &#160;

end of operations at operational sites. &#160;

Our largest asset 

removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment &#160;

of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and &#160;

gas 

platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas &#160;

production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. &#160;

The fair values 

of obligations for dismantling and removing these &#160;

facilities are recorded as a liability and &#160;

an increase to PP&#38;E 

at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated &#160;

discounted costs. &#160;

Fair value is estimated using a 

present value approach, incorporating assumptions &#160;

about estimated amounts and timing of settlements &#160;

and 

impacts of the use of technologies. &#160;

Estimating future asset removal costs requires &#160;

significant judgement. &#160;

Most 

of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, &#160;

in the future and the contracts and regulations &#160;

often 

have vague descriptions of what removal practices &#160;

and criteria must be met when the removal &#160;

event actually 

occurs. &#160;

The carrying value of our asset retirement &#160;

obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset 

removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other &#160;

compliance considerations, expenditure timing, &#160;

and other 

inputs into valuation of the obligation, including &#160;

discount and inflation rates, which are all &#160;

subject to change 

between the time of initial recognition of the liability &#160;

and future settlement of our obligation. &#160;

&#160;

Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement &#160;

as increases or decreases 

to DD&#38;A over the remaining life of the assets. &#160;

However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as 

well as previously sold assets for which we &#160;

retained the asset removal obligation, an increase &#160;

in the asset 

removal obligation can result in an immediate &#160;

charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&#38;E &#160;

due to the 

increased obligation would immediately be subject &#160;

to impairment, due to the low fair value of these &#160;

properties. &#160;

&#160;

In addition to asset removal obligations, under the &#160;

above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, &#160;

we have 

certain environmental-related projects. &#160;

These are primarily related to remediation &#160;

activities required by 

Canada and various states &#160;

within the U.S. at exploration and production sites. &#160;

Future environmental 

remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are &#160;

subject to change due to such factors as the 

uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown &#160;

time and extent of such remedial actions &#160;

that may be 

required, and the determination of our liability &#160;

in proportion to that of other responsible parties. &#160;

See Note 9&#8212;

Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental &#160;

Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements, for additional information. 

&#160;

Projected Benefit Obligations 

&#160;

Determination of the projected benefit obligations &#160;

for our defined benefit pension and postretirement &#160;

plans are 

important to the recorded amounts for such obligations &#160;

on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit 

expense in the income statement. &#160;

The actuarial determination of projected benefit &#160;

obligations and company 

contribution requirements involves judgment about &#160;

uncertain future events, including estimated &#160;

retirement 

dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality &#160;

rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan &#160;

assets, future 

health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization &#160;

of health care services by retirees. &#160;

Due to the specialized 

nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial &#160;

firms to assist in the determination of these &#160;

projected 

benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. &#160;

For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-

governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary &#160;

care on behalf of plan participants in the &#160;

determination 

of the judgmental assumptions used in determining &#160;

required company contributions into the &#160;

plans. &#160;

Due to 

differing objectives and requirements between financial &#160;

accounting rules and the pension plan funding 

regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, &#160;

the actuarial methods and assumptions &#160;

for the two 

purposes differ in certain important respects. &#160;

Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under 

pension and postretirement benefit plans not &#160;

funded by plan assets or investment returns, &#160;

but the judgmental 

assumptions used in the actuarial calculations &#160;

significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding 

patterns over time. &#160;

Projected benefit obligations are particularly &#160;

sensitive to the discount rate assumption. &#160;

A 

100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption &#160;

would increase projected benefit obligations &#160;

by 

$1,200 million. &#160;

Benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate &#160;

and return on plan assets assumptions. &#160;

A 

100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption &#160;

would increase annual benefit expense by 

$110 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return &#160;

on plan assets assumption would increase annual 

benefit expense by $80 million. &#160;

In determining the discount rate, we use yields &#160;

on high-quality fixed income 

investments matched to the estimated benefit &#160;

cash flows of our plans. &#160;

We are also exposed to the possibility 

that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension &#160;

plans during the year could exceed the total of &#160;

service 

and interest components of annual pension expense &#160;

and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion &#160;

of 

unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. &#160;

These benefit payments are based on decisions &#160;

by plan 

participants and are therefore difficult to predict. &#160;

In the event there is a significant reduction in the &#160;

expected 

years of future service of present employees or the &#160;

elimination of the accrual of defined benefits &#160;

for some or all 

of their future services for a significant number &#160;

of employees, we could recognize a curtailment &#160;

gain or loss. &#160;

See Note 17&#8212;Employee Benefit Plans, in the &#160;

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, &#160;

for additional 

information. 

&#160;

Contingencies 

&#160;

A number of claims and lawsuits are made against &#160;

the company arising in the ordinary course of &#160;

business. &#160;

Management exercises judgment related to accounting &#160;

and disclosure of these claims which includes &#160;

losses, 

damages, and underpayments associated with environmental &#160;

remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal 

disputes. &#160;

As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, &#160;

we reassess our position both with respect to 

amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes &#160;

to the probability of additional losses and potential 

exposure. &#160;

However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates &#160;

for a variety of reasons including legal, 

arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement &#160;

discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; 

interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; &#160;

expected timing of future actions; and proportion &#160;

of liability 

shared with other responsible parties. &#160;

Estimated future costs related to contingencies &#160;

are subject to change as 

events evolve and as additional information becomes &#160;

available during the administrative and litigation 

processes. &#160;

For additional information on contingent &#160;

liabilities, see the &#8220;Contingencies&#8221; section &#160;

within &#8220;Capital 

Resources and Liquidity&#8221; and Note 12&#8212;Contingencies &#160;

and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. 

&#160;

Income Taxes 

&#160;

We are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. &#160;

We record deferred tax assets and 

liabilities to account for the expected future tax &#160;

consequences of events that have been recognized &#160;

in our 

financial statements and our tax returns. &#160;

We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by 

a valuation allowance if we deem it is more &#160;

likely than not that some portion, or all, &#160;

of the deferred tax assets 

&#160;

will not be realized. &#160;

In assessing the need for adjustments &#160;

to existing valuation allowances, we consider all 

available positive and negative evidence. Positive &#160;

evidence includes reversals of temporary &#160;

differences, 

forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of &#160;

future business assumptions and applicable &#160;

tax planning 

strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative &#160;

evidence includes losses in recent years &#160;

as well as the 

forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable &#160;

period. In making our assessment regarding &#160;

valuation 

allowances, we weight the evidence based on &#160;

objectivity. &#160;

Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent 

in the determination of future taxable income, including &#160;

factors such as future operating conditions &#160;

and the 

assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal &#160;

income taxes (particularly as related to prevailing 

oil and gas prices). &#160;

See Note 18&#8212;Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. 

&#160;

We regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that &#160;

could result from 

assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions &#160;

in countries where we operate. &#160;

We recognize a tax benefit 

from an uncertain tax position when it is more &#160;

likely than not that the position will be sustained &#160;

upon 

examination, based on the technical merits &#160;

of the position. &#160;

These accruals for uncertain tax positions are 

subject to a significant amount of judgment and &#160;

are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis &#160;

in light of 

changing facts and circumstances considering the &#160;

progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, &#160;

changes in 

applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and &#160;

legislative guidance, or expiration of the &#160;

applicable statute 

of limitations. &#160;

See Note 18&#8212;Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated &#160;

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 

&#160;

This report includes forward-looking statements &#160;

within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities &#160;

Act of 

1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange &#160;

Act of 1934. &#160;

All statements other than statements of 

historical fact included or incorporated by reference in &#160;

this report, including, without limitation, &#160;

statements 

regarding our future financial position, business &#160;

strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and 

plans, objectives of management for future operations, &#160;

the anticipated benefits of the transaction &#160;

between us 

and Concho, the anticipated impact of the transaction &#160;

on the combined company&#8217;s business and future 

financial and operating results, the expected amount &#160;

and the timing of synergies from the transaction &#160;

are 

forward-looking statements. &#160;

Examples of forward-looking statements contained &#160;

in this report include our 

expected production growth and outlook on the &#160;

business environment generally, our expected capital budget 

and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning &#160;

future dividends. &#160;

You can often identify our forward-

looking statements by the words &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#160;

&#8220;budget,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;effort,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; 

&#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;guidance,&#8221; &#160;

&#8220;would&#8221; and similar expressions. &#160;

&#160;

We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates &#160;

and projections about 

ourselves and the industries in which we operate in &#160;

general. &#160;

We caution you these statements are not 

guarantees of future performance as they involve &#160;

assumptions that, while made in good faith, &#160;

may prove to be 

incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties &#160;

we cannot predict. &#160;

In addition, we based many of these forward-

looking statements on assumptions about future events &#160;

that may prove to be inaccurate. &#160;

Accordingly, our 

actual outcomes and results may differ materially from &#160;

what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-

looking statements. &#160;
