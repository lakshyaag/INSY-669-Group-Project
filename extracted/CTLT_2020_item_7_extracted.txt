 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with &#8220; Item 6. Selected Financial Data &#8221; and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should carefully read &#8220;Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in this Annual Report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors. &#8221; 

Overview 

We are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development and manufacturing solutions for drugs; protein, cell, and gene therapy biologics, and consumer health products. Our oral, injectable, cell and gene therapy and cell, and respiratory delivery technologies address the full diversity of the pharmaceutical industry, including small molecules; protein, cell, and gene therapy biologics; and consumer health products. Through our extensive capabilities and deep expertise in product development, we can help our customers take products to market faster, including nearly half of new drug products approved by the FDA in the last decade. Our advanced delivery technology platforms, which include those in our Softgel and Oral Technologies, Biologics, and Oral and Specialty Delivery segments, our proven formulation, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep intellectual property enable our customers to develop more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Across both development and delivery, our commitment to reliably supply our customers&#8217; and their patients&#8217; needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce more than 74 billion doses for nearly 7,000 customer products, or approximately 1 in every 20 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that through our investments in growth-enabling capacity and capabilities, our ongoing focus on operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing and introduction of new customer products, our innovation activities and patents, and our entry into new markets, we will continue to benefit from attractive and differentiated margins and realize the growth potential from these areas. 

In fiscal 2020, we engaged in a business reorganization of our operating segments to better align our internal business unit structure with our &#8220;Follow the Molecule&#8221; strategy and the increased focus on our biologics-related offerings. Under the revised structure, we changed the components and names of three of our four operating segments (with our fourth segment, Clinical Supply Services, unchanged). 

We currently operate in four operating segments, which also constitute our four reporting segments: Softgel and Oral Technologies , Biologics, Oral and Specialty Delivery, and Clinical Supply Services, as further described in "Business &#8212;Our Reporting Segments" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report . 

The COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and is affecting economic activity worldwide, including in the countries in which we, our customers, our suppliers, and our other business partners conduct business. Governments in affected regions have implemented, and may continue to implement, measures to protect public health, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings, and measures that affect the flow of goods between different regions. We have taken and continue to take steps to avoid or reduce infection or contamination and otherwise protect our employees and our business, in line with guidelines issued by the CDC, the WHO, and local authorities where we operate, to re-emphasize good hygiene practices, severely restrict non-employee access to our sites, reorganize our workflows where permitted to maximize social distancing, limit our employees to only business-critical travel (where permitted by local law), facilitate safer alternatives to travel to and from work, and employ remote-working strategies . In addition, t o address the multiple dimensions of the pandemic, two senior, multi-disciplinary teams reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer have been continuously monitoring the global situation, executing mitigation activities whenever and wherever required, and planning for a phased and structured return to our facilities as circumstances will permit for those employees who have been remote-working since the pandemic began. 

We have reviewed and will continue to analyze our supply chain to identify any risk, delay, or concern that may have an impact on our ability to deliver our services and products. To date, we have not identified any significant risk, delay, or concern that would have a substantial effect on such delivery. We have adopted various procedures to minimize and manage any future disruption to our ongoing operations. These include procuring expanded safety stocks of raw materials and personal protective equipment across our network, as well as ongoing monitoring of our suppliers&#8217; stock levels to assure future deliveries. Our existing procedures, which are consistent with cGMP and other regulatory standards, are intended to assure the integrity of our supply against any contamination. We have added a detailed response plan to manage any impact of the virus on employee 

health, site operations, and product supply, including immediate assessment of the health of employees reporting symptoms, comprehensive risk assessment of any impact to quality, additional cleaning protocols, and alternative shift patterns to compensate should fewer employees be available. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations to date, but, at this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our future financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain and will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including the duration of the pandemic, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, and the actions governments, the pharmaceutical industry, competitors, suppliers, customers, patients, and others may take to contain or address its direct and indirect effects. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures may also have an adverse impact on the healthcare systems, global economic conditions, or economic conditions in one or more regions where we or our customers operate, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have observed some increases in customer delays and cancellations, occasional increases in absenteeism of production employees in our facilities in certain affected regions, and disruptions in certain clinical trials supported by our Clinical Supply Services segment, with a small percentage of our customers expecting a reduction in demand and a larger percentage expecting an increase in demand, in each case due to circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures. We have also seen revenue increases and the potential for further revenue increases related to projects seeking to address the COVID-19 pandemic or its effects. Future financial periods may reflect greater effects of the pandemic on the results of our operations. 

See also &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business and Industry &#8212; Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic&#8221; elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding significant areas of judgment. Management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements than others. 

Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. A discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows. 

Revenue 

We sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers. The majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply, development services, and clinical supply services. On July 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( &#8220; ASU &#8221; ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , codified as Accounting Standards Codification ( &#8220; ASC &#8221;) 606, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. For discussion on the impact of adopting ASC 606 on our accounting, refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment. For our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue, the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements. Due to the regulated nature of our business, these contract terms are highly interdependent and, therefore, are considered to be a single combined performance obligation. For our development services and clinical supply services revenue, our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation. If a contract contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the &#8220;relative standalone selling price&#8221; as defined under ASC 606. Generally, we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration. If observable standalone selling prices are not available, we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach, representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service. Revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement. Determining the measure of progress that consistently 

depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment. 

Licensing revenue 

We occasionally enter into arrangements with customers that include licensing of functional intellectual property, including drug formulae, or other intangible property (&#8220;out-licensing&#8221;). We do not have any material license arrangement that contains more than one performance obligation. Our out-licensing generally entitles us to nonrefundable, up-front fees or royalties. Nonrefundable, up-front license fees are recognized as revenue when the licensed property is made available for the customer&#8217;s use and benefit, provided there is no unsatisfied performance obligation included in the arrangement. Royalty payments from such arrangements are recognized when subsequent sale or usage of an item subject to the royalty occurs and the performance obligation to which royalty relates is satisfied. 

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 

We account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with ASC 350 , Intangible and Other Assets . Under ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response, or if no qualitative assessment is performed, a quantitative assessment, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates, and economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2018 and 2020, we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment, but in fiscal 2019 we began with the qualitative assessment. The evaluations performed in fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020 resulted in no impairment charge . 

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Series A Preferred Stock Dividend Adjustment Feature 

The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock include a dividend adjustment feature to provide the holders with certain protections against a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock. Because this adjustment feature depends in part on the value of external metrics at future dates, over which we have no control, this feature is accounted for separately from the rest of the Series A Preferred Stock as a derivative instrument, which is measured at fair value, as of the valuation date, using a combination of (i) a Monte Carlo simulation and (ii) a binomial lattice model, which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock and is based on changes in the market prices of shares of our Common Stock over successive periods. Key assumptions used in both models include the current market price of one share of the Common Stock and its historical and expected volatility, risk-neutral interest rates, and the remaining term of the adjustment feature. The calculation of the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is highly sensitive to changes in the unobservable inputs, such as the expected volatility and the Company&#8217;s specific credit spread . We recognize the derivative as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and revalue it as of the end of each quarterly reporting period; changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Income Taxes 

In accordance wit h ASC 740, Income Taxes , we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and the corresponding financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, but we have not made any provision for U.S. income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2020 . 

The 2017 Tax Act imposed taxes on so-called &#8220;global intangible low-taxed income&#8221; (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. company. In accordance with ASC 740, we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. 

We assess the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We evaluate four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets: 

&#8226; carrybacks of existing NOLs (if and to the extent permitted by tax law); 

&#8226; future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; 

&#8226; tax planning strategies; and 

&#8226; future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. 

We consider the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management&#8217;s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets as a result of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law. 

Unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. 

Our accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the U.S. and in each of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly European tax jurisdictions. The determination of income subject to taxation in each tax-paying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction. For those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates, we apply transfer-pricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions. The estimates and assumptions used in these allocations can result in uncertainty in the measured tax benefit. 

Factors Affecting our Performance 

Fluctuations in Operating Results 

Our annual financial reporting periods end on June 30. Our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter, and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue. These fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our, and our customers&#8217;, annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental Europe and the U.K., the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions, clinical trial and research and development schedules, the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration, and, to a lesser extent, the time of the year some of our customers&#8217; products are in higher demand. 

Acquisition and Related Integration Efforts 

Our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms. In fiscal 2018, we acquired Catalent Indiana in order to enhance our biologics capabilities, and it has been integrated into our Biologics segment. In fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisitions of Juniper, based in the U.K., in August 2018 and of a gene therapy business, based in the U.S., in May 2019, which have been integrated into our Oral and Specialty Delivery and Biologics segments, respectively. In fiscal 2020, we completed the acquisitions of additional U.S.-based gene therapy assets from Novavax, in July 2019, and MaSTherCell, based in Belgium and the U.S., in February 2020, which have been integrated into our Biologics segment. We also completed the acquisition of the Anagni facility based in Italy, in January 2020, which has been integrated into our Oral and Specialty Delivery and Biologics segments. 

Foreign Exchange Rates 

Our operating network is global, and, as a result, we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the currency in which we report our financial results, and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates. In fiscal 2020, approximately 41% of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the United States. Significant foreign currencies for our operations include the British pound, European euro, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Japanese yen, and the Canadian dollar. 

Trends Affecting Our Business 

Industry 

We participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, which has been estimated to generate more than $1 trillion in annual revenue, including, but not limited to, the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health, which includes the over-the-counter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors. Innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market, while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets. Sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals. Payors, both public and private, have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs, access and spending controls, and health technology assessment techniques, favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes. 

New Molecule Development and R&#38;D Sourcing 

Continued strengthening in early-stage development pipelines for drugs and biologics, compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity, support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions. Large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their R&#38;D resources, increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions. Additionally, an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure, and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners. 

Demographics 

Aging population demographics in developed countries, combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations, will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals, biologics, and consumer health products. Increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments, and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories. 

Finally, we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face, global supply chain complexity, and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation, improved outcomes, and treatment cost reduction, all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies. 

Non-GAAP Metrics 

As described in this section, management uses various financial metrics, including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in U.S. GAAP, to measure and assess the performance of our business, to make critical business decisions, and to assess our compliance with certain financial obligations. We therefore believe that presentation of certain of these non-GAAP metrics in this Annual Report will aid investors in understanding our business. 

EBITDA from operations 

Management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense, expense/(benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests ( &#8220; EBITDA from operations &#8221; ). EBITDA from operations is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. 

We believe that the presentation of EBITDA from operations enhances an investor&#8217;s understanding of our financial performance. We believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes. In addition, given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property, plant and equipment, depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure. We believe that disclosing EBITDA from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt, and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. We present EBITDA from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures. Our definition of EBITDA from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA from operations defined under U.S. GAAP is net earnings/(loss). Included in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis is a reconciliation of net earnings/(loss) to EBITDA from operations. 

In addition, we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before non-controlling interest, other (income)/expense, impairments, restructuring costs, interest expense, income tax expense/(benefit), and depreciation and amortization ( &#8220; Segment EBITDA &#8221; ). 

Adjusted EBITDA 

Under the Credit Agreement and the Indentures, the ability of Operating Company to engage in certain activities, such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments and paying certain dividends, is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as &#8220; Consolidated EBITDA &#8221; in the Credit Agreement and &#8220;EBITDA&#8221; in the Indentures). Adjusted EBITDA is a covenant compliance measure in our Credit Agreement and Indentures, particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments. Adjusted EBITDA is based on the definitions in the Credit Agreement, is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 

In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a performance metric that guides management in its operation of and planning for the future of the business and drives certain management compensation programs. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure of our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core business, including interest expense and non-cash charges like depreciation and amortization. 

The measure under U.S. GAAP most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings/(loss). In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring and other items that are deducted when calculating EBITDA from operations and net earnings, consistent with the requirements of the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA, among other things: 

&#8226; does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges; 

&#8226; does not include cash and non-cash restructuring, severance and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance operations; 

&#8226; adds back any non-controlling interest expense, which represents minority investors&#8217; ownership of non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and is, therefore, not available; and 

&#8226; includes estimated cost savings that have not yet been fully reflected in our results. 

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share 

We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share (which we sometimes refer to as &#8220; Adjusted EPS &#8221;) as performance metrics. Adjusted Net Income is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. We believe that providing information concerning Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share enhance an investor&#8217;s understanding of our financial performance. We believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, and we use these measures for business planning and executive compensation purposes. We define Adjusted Net Income as net earnings/(loss) adjusted for (1) earnings or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, (2) amortization attributable to purchase accounting, and (3) income or loss from non-controlling interest in majority-owned operations. We also make adjustments for other cash and non-cash items (as shown above, in &#8220;&#8212;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221;), partially offset by our estimate of the tax effects as a result of such cash and non-cash items. Our definition of Adjusted Net Income may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted Net Income per share is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 

Use of Constant Currency 

As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors&#8217; ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Annual Report, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Summary Two-Year Key Financial Performance Metrics 

The below tables summarize our results in fiscal 2020 and 2019 on several financial metrics we use to measure performance. Refer to the discussions below regarding performance and the use of key financial metrics and &#8220;&#8212;N on-GAAP Metrics &#8212;Use of Constant Currency&#8221; concerning the measurement of revenue at &#8220; constant currency. &#8221;

Net Revenue 

Net revenue increased by $612.2 million, or 24%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Net revenue increased 14% as a result of acquisitions, which was partially offset by a 2% decrease in net revenue due to a facility divestiture. We acquired Juniper in August 2018, various gene therapy assets in May and July 2019, the Anagni facility in January 2020, and MaSTherCell in February 2020 and divested a manufacturing site in Australia in October 2019. Net revenue increased 12% without the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on a constant currency basis, primarily related to volume increases across all of our segments. 

Gross Margin 

Gross margin increased by $188.1 million, or 23%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily as a result of our acquisitions and increased volumes as discussed above. On a constant-currency basis, gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue, decreased 10 basis points to 31.8% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, compared to 31.9% in the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to recent acquisitions. 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense 

Selling, general, and administrative expense increased by $68.9 million, or 13%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses during the year, including transaction fees of $5.9 million related to the acquisitions of our gene therapy business, Anagni and MaSTherCell. Additionally, there were incremental selling, general, and administrative expenses from the acquired companies of $80.9 million, primarily driven by $28.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $21.7 million of employee-related costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses further increased approximately $11.3 million for non-cash equity-based compensation driven by the achievement of certain performance-based metrics during the fiscal year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense attributable to prior-year amortization of $13.0 million related to licensing rights within our Oral and Specialty Delivery segment and a $3.1 million decrease related to the October 2019 divestiture of an Australian facility within our Softgel and Oral Technologies segment. 

Impairment Charges and Loss on Sale of Assets 

Impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 were $5.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Impairment charges in the current year were primarily driven by the sale of the Company&#8217;s facility in Braeside, Australia. The prior year impairment charges were driven by a software-related intangible asset in our Clinical Supply Services segment that was not implemented and whose value therefore was not fully recoverable. 

Restructuring and Other 

Restructuring and other charges of $5.5 million in fiscal 2020 decreased by $8.6 million compared to the amounts in fiscal 2019 and were driven by employee-related actions. Restructuring expenses varies period-to-period based on site consolidation efforts and other efforts to further streamline the business. 

Interest Expense, net 

Interest expense, net, of $126.1 million in fiscal 2020 increased by $15.5 million, or 14%, compared to fiscal 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily driven by an increase in outstanding indebtedness driven by Operating Company&#8217;s June 2019 offering of the USD 2027 Notes and its February 2020 offering of the Euro 2028 Notes. The increase was partially offset by savings in both interest paid and in interest rate due to repayment of Operating Company&#8217;s euro-denominated term loans and euro-denominated 4.75% Senior Notes due 2024 (the &#8220;Euro 2024 Notes&#8221;). 

For additional information concerning our debt and financing arrangements, including the changing mi x of debt and equity in our capital structure, see &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Debt and Financing Arrangements&#8221; and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

A component of the purchase price for the acquisition of Catalent Indiana in fiscal 2018 consisted of $200.0 million in deferred purchase consideration payable in four annual $50.0 million installments on the first four anniversary dates of the acquisition. We made the two first such payments in October 2018 and October 2019, and the present value of the balance is accounted for as debt, with the difference between the nominal value and the present value considered imputed interest expense. 

Other Expense, net &#160; 

Other expense, net of $7.9 million for fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by financing charges of $16.3 million. The financing charges included a $6.3 million write-off of previously capitalized financing charges related to Operating Company&#8217;s recently repaid euro-denominated term loan under its senior secured credit facilities and the recently redeemed Euro 2024 Notes, and a $10.0 million premium on early redemption of the Euro 2024 Notes. The loss was partially offset by a foreign currency gain of $3.0 million and a derivative gain of $3.2 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the Series A Preferred Stock. 

Other expense, net for fiscal 2019 of $2.7 million was primarily driven by financing charges of $15.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2027 Notes and was partially offset by a gain of $12.9 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the Series A Preferred Stock and $0.5 million of 

unrealized foreign currency gains in the year. See Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for more details on the Series A Preferred Stock dividend adjustment. 

Provision/(Benefit) for Income Taxes 

Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was $39.7 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $260.4 million. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was $22.9 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $160.3 million. The income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year primarily due to changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions, as well as the impact of discrete items, including equity compensation. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, other special items, and other discrete tax items, including the reversal portions of federal and foreign valuation allowances, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

Net revenue in our Softgel and Oral Technologies segment increased by $44.1 million, or 4%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Net revenue increased 8%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of divestitures. The increase relates to continued strong demand across our portfolio of prescription products within North America, which is partially attributable to recently launched products. Demand for our portfolio of consumer health products continues, predominantly within Europe. 

Softgel and Oral Technologies&#8217; Segment EBITDA increased by $24.7 million, or 10%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA increased 13%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of divestitures. The increase primarily relates to the demand increase across our portfolio of higher-margin, prescription products within North America as well as our consumer health business, in line with the revenue growth within Europe. 

In October 2019, we divested a manufacturing site in Australia in the Softgel and Oral Technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations. The site divestiture resulted in a decrease in net revenue of 4% and Segment EBITDA of 3% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

Net revenue in our Biologics segment increased by $453.1 million, or 79%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, the net revenue increase was driven primarily by strong end-market demand for our U.S. drug product and U.S. drug substance offerings, with the former being delivered through improved capacity utilization. Additional site readiness activities related to COVID-19 vaccination programs across our gene therapy, U.S. drug product, and U.S. drug substance offerings also contributed towards the net revenue increase. Drug substance growth was partially offset by the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services as well as softening demand for our European drug product offering. 

Biologics' Segment EBITDA increased by $91.4 million, or 62%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA, excluding the effect of acquisitions, increased 26% from the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to increased demand for our U.S. drug product offering as well as site readiness activities related to COVID-19 vaccination programs across our gene therapy, U.S. drug product, and U.S. drug substance offerings. Segment EBITDA growth was partially offset by decreased volume for our U.S. drug substance product offering, predominantly due to the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services and softening demand for our European drug product offering. 

Beginning in May 2019, we acquired the assets comprising our gene therapy business, in January 2020, we acquired the Anagni facility, part of which operates within the Biologics segment, and, in February 2020, we acquired MaSTherCell. Together these acquisitions increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA on an inorganic basis in our Biologics segment by 52% and 36%, respectively, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding prior-year period. 

Oral and Specialty Delivery segment

Net revenue in our Oral and Specialty Delivery segment increased by $83.5 million, or 14%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, the increase was principally attributable to new product launches within our respiratory and ophthalmic specialty platform. Strong end-market demand for prescription oral commercial products across North America and Europe also contributed towards the net revenue increase. Revenue growth was partially offset by a prior-year favorable impact of a one-time up-front license fee as well as decreased volume in our respiratory and ophthalmic specialty platform, due to strong prior-year demand, related to an anticipated new product introduction. 

Oral and Specialty Delivery&#8217;s Segment EBITDA increased by $28.0 million, or 16%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA without acquisitions increased 10%, primarily due 

to new product launches within our respiratory and ophthalmic specialty platform. Strong end-market demand for higher-margin oral commercial products across North America and Europe also contributed towards the Segment EBITDA increase. EBITDA growth was partially offset by a prior-year favorable impact of a one-time up-front license fee and decreased volume in our respiratory and ophthalmic specialty platform due to strong prior-year demand, related to an anticipated new product introduction. 

On an inorganic basis, our Juniper and Anagni facility acquisitions together increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA in our Oral and Specialty Delivery segment by 7% and 6%, respectively, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.

Net revenue in our Softgel and Oral Technologies segment decreased by $38.6 million, or 4%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of divestitures, net revenue decreased by 3%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in net revenue without divestitures on a constant-currency basis was primarily driven by lower end-market demand for a key product within our U.S.-based commercial oral technologies solutions platform and a decrease of 1%, across our North America and Latin America consumer health business, resulting from a shortage in ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient supply during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, which was resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter. This was partially offset by volume increases across our consumer health business within Europe. 

Softgel and Oral Technologies&#8217; Segment EBITDA decreased by $31.2 million, or 11%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the reduction of licensing revenue profit of 1%, Segment EBITDA excluding divestitures decreased 10%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower end-market demand for a key product within our U.S.-based commercial oral technologies solutions platform and a decrease in Segment EBITDA of 2%, across our North America and Latin America consumer health business, resulting from a shortage in ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient supply during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, which was resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter. This was partially offset by volume increases across our consumer health business within Europe. 

In December 2017, we divested two manufacturing sites in Asia-Pacific in the Softgel and Oral Technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations. The site divestitures resulted in a decrease to net revenue of 1% with no impact to Segment EBITDA in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

Net revenue in our Biologics segment increased by $142.7 million, or 33%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the net revenue increase was driven primarily by increased end-market demand for our drug product offerings, offset slightly by decreased volume demand related to our U.S. drug substance product offering due to the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services. 

Biologics' Segment EBITDA increased by $37.1 million, or 33%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased 1% from the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to strong U.S drug product demand, partially offset by the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services in our U.S. drug substance platform as well as unfavorable product mix in our European specialty drug product platform. 

On an inorganic basis, our Catalent Indiana and Catalent Maryland acquisitions together increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA in our Biologics segment by 24% and 32%, respectively, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.

Net revenue in our Oral and Specialty Delivery segment increased by $101.9 million, or 20%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the net revenue increase related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform, the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our U.S.-based oral delivery solutions platform, and a favorable impact from licensing revenue recorded during the third quarter. The favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction, which consisted of a grant to a third party of the Company&#8217;s right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a one-time up-front license fee. 

Oral and Specialty Delivery&#8217;s Segment EBITDA increased by $48.6 million, or 37%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA without acquisitions increased 17%, primarily due to an increase in volume related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform, the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our U.S.-based oral delivery solutions platform, and a favorable impact from licensing revenue recorded during the third quarter. The favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction, which consisted of a grant to a third party of the Company&#8217;s right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a one-time up-front license fee. 

On an inorganic basis, our Juniper acquisition increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA in our Oral and Specialty Delivery segment by 12% and 20%, respectively, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.

Net revenue in our Clinical Supply Services segment decreased by $102.7 million, or 24%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, the Company recorded comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus a gross basis, resulting in a decrease to net revenue of 25%, partially offset by an increase in revenue primarily due to higher comparator sourcing volume, as well as growth within our storage and distribution and manufacturing and packaging businesses. 

Clinical Supply Services' Segment EBITDA increased by $10.9 million, or 14%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The increase was primarily due to a favorable shift within the storage and distribution business, increased growth in project management revenue, and improved capacity utilization across the network based on prior strategic investments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources and use of Cash 

Our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations and the net proceeds of capital market activities. The principal uses of cash are to fund operating and capital expenditures, business or asset acquisitions, interest payments on debt, the payment of deferred purchase consideration from the Catalent Indiana acquisition, the payment of the quarterly dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, and any mandatory or discretionary principal payment on our debt. At the current stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of June 30, 2020, the aggregate amount of each regular quarterly dividend, if paid in cash, is $8.1 million. As of June 30, 2020, Operating Company had available a $550.0 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2024, the capacity of which is reduced by the amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior secured credit facilities and those short-term borrowings referred to as swing-line borrowings. At June 30, 2020, we had $6.7 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility. 

We believe that our cash on hand, cash from operations, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, including with respect to payment of our quarterly regular dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, if paid in cash, and the amounts expected to become due with respect to our pending capital projects. We have no significant maturity under any of our bank or note debt until the USD 2026 Notes mature in January 2026. As of June 30, 2020, we have only two remaining payments of $50.0 million each, due in October 2020 and 2021, on the deferred purchase consideration for the acquisition of Catalent Indiana. 

Cash Flows 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 

The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows from operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019: 

##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended June 30, &#160; (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Change $

Operating Activities 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $440.3 million, an increase of $192.6 million compared to $247.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. Cash flow from operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 increased primarily due to an increase in operating earnings, which increased from $273.9 million in fiscal 2019 to $394.4 million in fiscal 2020. 

Investing Activities 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $827.5 million compared to $1,510.4 million during fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 cash used in investing activities primarily consists of $1,291.0 million of payments for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Of this amount, $1,163.5 million was paid for the acquisition of Catalent Maryland in the fourth quarter and the remaining $127.5 million was paid for the acquisition of Juniper in the first quarter. In fiscal 2020, $379.7 million of cash was paid for the MaSTherCell and Anagni acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Other uses of cash in investing activities included cash used in acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment, which totaled $465.8 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $218.1 million in fiscal 2019. 

Financing Activities 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $1,001.7 million, which decreased compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,201.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The fiscal 2019 cash provided by financing activities consists of net proceeds of $1,447.6 million from borrowings, $646.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and $445.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our Common Stock, partially offset by $1,290.3 million of payments against long-term obligations. The fiscal 2020 balance primarily consists of &#8364;825.0 million ($909.1 million) aggregate principal amount of Operating Company&#8217;s 2.375% 

Senior Notes due 2028 (the &#8220;Euro 2028 Notes&#8221;). The cash proceeds from the borrowings was partially offset by repayment in full of the outstanding borrowings under Operating Company's euro-denominated term loans under its senior secured credit facilities, which would otherwise have matured in May 2024, and Euro 2024 Notes, which would otherwise have matured in December 2024. The cash from financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 also includes the net proceeds from two equity offerings that we completed in fiscal 2020. In February 2020 and June 2020, we completed public offerings of our Common Stock (the &#8220;February 2020 Equity Offering&#8221; and the &#8220;June 2020 Equity Offering,&#8221; respectively). We sold 8.4 million and 7.7 million shares of Common Stock, respectively, at a price of $58.58 and $70.72 per share, respectively, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. The net proceeds from the February 2020 Equity Offering of $494.2 million were used to repay $100.0 million of borrowings under Operating Company's revolving credit facility and to fund the consideration for the MaSTherCell acquisition due at its closing, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the June 2020 Equity Offering of $547.5 million were used to repay $200.0 million of prophylactic borrowings under Operating Company's revolving credit facility, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 

Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis of our cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 may be found in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Cash Flows&#8212;Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 &#8221; section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 , filed with the SEC on August 27, 2019. 

Debt and Financing Arrangements 

Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Fourth Amendment 

In May 2019, Operating Company completed the Fourth Amendment. As part of the Fourth Amendment, Operating Company borrowed $950.0 million aggregate principal amount through incremental term B loans ( &#8220; Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans &#8221; ) and replaced the existing revolving credit commitments of $200.0 million in its senior secured credit facilities with new revolving credit commitments of $550.0 million ( &#8220; Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments &#8221; ). The Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans will mature on May 17, 2026. The Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments constitute revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement with the same principal terms as the previously existing revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on May 17, 2024. Under the Credit Agreement, the applicable rate for U.S. dollar-denominated term loans, including the Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans is LIBOR (formerly known as the London Interbank Offered Rate, subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus 2.25%. The applicable rate for the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments is initially LIBOR plus 2.25%, and such rate can additionally be reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00% in future periods based on a measure of Operating Company's total leverage ratio. 

In April 2020, we entered into an interest-rate swap agreement with Bank of America N.A. as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variable-interest obligation associated with our U.S dollar-denominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities, so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt became fixed at a certain rate, thereby reducing the impact of future interest-rate changes on future interest expense. As a result of entering into the interest-rate swap agreement, the floating portion of the applicable rate on $500.0 million of the term loan is now effectively fixed at 1.26% for a total fixed rate of 3.51%. 

U.S. dollar-denominated 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026 

In October 2017, Operating Company completed a private offering of the USD 2026 Notes. The USD 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Operating Company that guarantee its senior secured credit facilities. The USD 2026 Notes were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The USD 2026 Notes will mature on January 15, 2026 and bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2018. 

U.S. dollar-denominated 5.00% Senior Notes due 2027 

In June 2019, Operating Company completed a private offering of the USD 2027 Notes. The USD 2027 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Operating Company that guarantee its senior secured credit facilities. The USD 2027 Notes were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The USD 2027 Notes will mature on July 15, 2027 and bear interest at the rate of 5.00% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2020. 

Euro-denominated 2.375% Senior Notes due 2028 

In March 2020, Operating Company completed a private offering of &#8364;825.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Euro 2028 Notes. The Euro 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Operating Company that guarantee its senior secured credit facilities. The Euro 2028 Notes were offered in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the U.S. only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Euro 2028 Notes will mature on March 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 2.375% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2020. The proceeds of the Euro 2028 Notes after payment of the offering fees and expenses were used to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under Operating Company's euro-denominated term loans under its senior secured credit agreement, which would otherwise have matured in May 2024, and Euro 2024 Notes, which would otherwise have matured in December 2024, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. 

Deferred Purchase Consideration 

Of the $950.0 million aggregate nominal purchase price for the Catalent Indiana acquisition , $200.0 million was payable in four annual $50.0 million installments. The Company made installment payments in October 2018 and 2019. The remainder of the deferred purchase consideration is due in October 2020 and 2021 and is recorded at fair value, with the difference between the remaining nominal amount and the fair value balance deemed to be imputed interest. 

Debt Covenants 

Senior Secured Credit Facilities 

The Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, Operating Company&#8217;s (and Operating Company&#8217;s restricted subsidiaries&#8217;) ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; create liens on assets; engage in mergers and consolidations; sell assets; pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock; repay subordinated indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; make investments, loans, or advances; make certain acquisitions; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; amend material agreements governing Operating Company&#8217;s subordinated indebtedness; and change Operating Company&#8217;s lines of business. 

The Credit Agreement also contains change-of-control provisions and certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. The Revolving Credit Facility requires compliance with a net leverage covenant when there is a 30% or more draw outstanding at a period end. As of June 30, 2020, Operating Company was in compliance with all material covenants under the Credit Agreement. 

Subject to certain exceptions, the Credit Agreement permits Operating Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. None of Operating Company&#8217;s non-U.S. subsidiaries or Puerto Rico subsidiaries is a guarantor of the loans. 

&#160; 

Under the Credit Agreement, Operating Company&#8217;s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as &#8220;Consolidated EBITDA&#8221; in the Credit Agreement). Adjusted EBITDA is based on the definitions in the Credit Agreement, is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. See &#8220;&#8212;Non-GAAP Metrics&#8221; for further details on Adjusted EBITDA. 

The Senior Notes 

The Indentures contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of Operating Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee more debt or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; make certain investments; sell certain assets; create liens; consolidate, merge, sell; or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; enter into certain transactions with their affiliates, and designate their subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the Indentures. The Indentures also contain customary events of default including, but not limited to, nonpayment, breach of covenants, and payment or acceleration defaults in certain other indebtedness of Operating Company or certain of its subsidiaries. Upon an event of default, either the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of each of the then-outstanding Senior Notes, or the applicable Trustee under the Indentures, may declare the applicable Senior Notes immediately due and payable; or in certain circumstances, the applicable Senior Notes will become automatically immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2020, Operating Company was in compliance with all material covenants under the Indentures. 

Liquidity in Foreign Subsidiaries 

As of June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the amounts of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $228.0 million and $203.9 million, respectively, out of the total consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $953.2 million and $345.4 million, respectively. These balances are dispersed across many international locations around the world. 

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income per share

(5) Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 reflects the effect of approximately 13.1 million "if-converted" shares of Common Stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

A portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interest-rate fluctuations. We may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixed-and floating-rate assets and liabilities. In April 2020, we entered into an interest-rate swap agreement with Bank of America N.A. as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variable-interest obligation associated with our U.S dollar-denominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities, so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt became fixed at a certain rate, thereby reducing the impact of future interest-rate changes on future interest expense. The applicable rate for the U.S. dollar-denominated term loan is LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus 2.25%; however, as a result of entering into the interest-rate swap agreement, the floating portion of the applicable rate on $500.0 million of the term loan is now effectively fixed at 1.26% for a total fixed rate of 3.51%. 

Currency Risk Management 

We are exposed to fluctuations in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate on our investments in our foreign operations in Europe. While we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency, we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our European operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros. At June 30, 2020, we had $909.9 million of euro-denominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period. 

From time to time, we may use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs. In addition, we may use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities. Currently, we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts. We expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future. 

Contractual Obligations 

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of June 30, 2020:

(1) Estima ted future payments with respect to our obligations and other liabilities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar were calculated using the currency exchange rates in effect as of June 30, 2020. 

(2) Represents gross maturities of our long-term debt obligations, excluding finance lease obligations as of June 30, 2020. 

(3) Represents estimated interest payments relating to our long-term obligations, including our finance lease obligations. Estimated future interest payments on our variable-rate debt obligations were calculated using the interest rates in effect as of June 30, 2020. 

(4) Represents maturities of our finance lease obligations included within long-term debt as of June 30, 2020. 

(5) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms. 

(6) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations disclosed above may include estimates of the period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders entered into in the normal course of business and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period. 

(7) Primarily relates to certain long-term employee-related liabilities for operations under programs that we have discontinued. 

The table excludes our retirement and other post-employment benefits ( &#8220; OPEB &#8221; ) obligations. The timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. In fiscal 2021, we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Beyond fiscal 2021, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance but are generally paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and principally depend on the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

The table also excludes $24.7 million of funded deferred compensation payments owed as of June 30, 2020 to certain employees participating in our deferred compensation plan. The timing and amount of payments for these obligations depend on participant-directed distributions, withdrawals, and status. As part of the deferred compensation plan, we have a corresponding $23.4 million of deferred compensation investments as of June 30, 2020, which will be used to fund future obligations to the participants. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Other than short-term operating leases and outstanding letters of credit as discussed above, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangement as of June 30, 2020. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.
