Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Year ended December 31, 2020 

&#8226; Firm Net revenues were up 16% and Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was up 22%, reflecting strength across all business segments, and resulting in an ROTCE of 15.2%, or 15.4% excluding the impact of E*TRADE integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; Institutional Securities Net revenues of $26 billion increased 27% from the prior year and segment Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley increased 52% from the prior year. These increases were the result of higher sales and trading revenues on strong client engagement and market volatility, combined with an increase in underwriting revenues on elevated volumes, supported by a constructive market environment. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered a pre-tax profit margin of 23.0%, or 24.2% excluding integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). Results reflect higher Asset management revenues, driven by growth in client assets, higher Transactional revenues, and incremental revenues as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

&#8226; Investment Management reported long-term net flows of $41 billion in 2020 and AUM of $781 billion as of December 31, 2020, resulting in an increase in Asset management revenues of 15% compared with the prior year. 

&#8226; The Firm expense efficiency ratio was 70% for the year, both including and excluding the impact of integration-related expenses (See &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; Our provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $762 million. 

&#8226; At December 31, 2020, our standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 17.4%. 

Strategic Transactions 

&#8226; On October 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of E*TRADE. For further information, see &#8220;Business Segments&#8212;Wealth Management&#8221; herein and Note 3 to the financial statements. 

&#8226; On October 8, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Eaton Vance Corp. (&#8220;Eaton Vance&#8221;), subject to customary closing conditions. For further information, see &#8220;Business Segments&#8212;Investment Management&#8221; herein.

Non-interest Expenses 1 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $20,854 million in 2020 increased 11% from the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in discretionary incentive compensation and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher revenues, higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, and incremental compensation as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $12,926 million in 2020 increased 15% from the prior year, primarily as a result of higher volume-related expenses, incremental operating and other expenses as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition, integration-related expenses, increased information processing and communications expenses, and an increase in the provision for credit losses for lending commitments, partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development expenses. 

Income Taxes 

&#8226; The increase in the Firm&#8217;s effective tax rate in 2020 compared with the prior year is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. In 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards. 

&#8226; The provision for income taxes in 2019 includes net discrete tax benefits of $475 million, primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits related to conversion of employee share-based awards.

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $25,948 million in 2020 increased 27% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher revenues from sales and trading and underwriting, partially offset by losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale and an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment. 

&#8226; Wealth Management net revenues of $19,055 million in 2020, including the incremental impact of the E*TRADE acquisition, increased 7% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher Asset management revenues, driven by growth in client assets, and higher Transactional revenues, largely driven by higher Commissions and fees, partially offset by lower Net interest. 

&#8226; Investment Management net revenues of $3,734 million in 2020 were relatively unchanged from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower accrued carried interest, offset by higher Asset management revenues resulting from higher average AUM.

2. For a discussion of how the geographic breakdown for net revenues is determined, see Note 23 to the financial statements. 

Revenues in Asia increased 32% in 2020, primarily driven by sales and trading within the Institutional Securities business segment. Revenues in the Americas increased 16% in 2020, primarily driven by the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.

Coronavirus Disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic and related voluntary and government-imposed social and business restrictions have had, and will likely continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions and the environment in which we operate our businesses. We have a return-to-workplace program, which is based on role, location and employee willingness and ability to return and focused on the health and safety of all staff. At this time, however, we do not expect significant numbers of staff to return to offices before the third quarter of 2021. The Firm continues to be fully operational, with approximately 90% of employees in the Americas and globally working from home as of December 31, 2020. 

Though we are unable to estimate the extent of the impact, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic crisis may have adverse impacts on our future operating results. To date, given our business model, economic conditions have affected our businesses in different ways. We have increased our allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments, and the persistence of low interest rates has continued to negatively affect our net interest margin in the Wealth Management business segment. Overall for the Firm, increased client trading and capital markets activity has benefited Institutional Securities business segment results in Sales and trading and Investment banking underwriting revenues. However, the high levels of client trading and capital markets activity experienced in the current year may not be repeated and certain other client-driven activity could become subdued. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221; 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

1. Adjusted amounts exclude the effect of costs related to the integration of E*TRADE, net of tax as appropriate. Total integration-related expenses on a pre-tax basis include $151 million in Compensation expenses and $80 million in Non-compensation expenses. For more information, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 

2. ROE and ROTCE represent earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding integration-related costs, both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted. 

3. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). 

4. The sums of the segments' Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

5. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Target 

In January 2021, we established a 2-year ROTCE Target of 14% to 16%, excluding integration-related expenses. 

Our ROTCE Target is a forward-looking statement that was based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: mergers and acquisitions; macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative, accounting, tax and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; outsized legal expenses or penalties; the ability to control expenses; and capital levels. See &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional information. 

Given the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain if the ROTCE Target will be met within the originally stated time frame. See &#8220;Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic&#8221; herein and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for further information on market and economic conditions and their effects on our financial results. 

For further information on non-GAAP measures (ROTCE excluding integration-related expenses), see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 23 to the financial statements for information on intersegment transactions. 

Net Revenues 

Investment Banking 

Investment banking revenues are derived from client engagements in which we act as an adviser, underwriter or distributor of capital. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, these revenues are primarily composed of fees earned from underwriting equity and fixed income securities, syndicating loans and advisory services in relation to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and corporate restructurings. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, these revenues are derived from the distribution of newly issued securities. 

Trading 

Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from transactions in financial instruments, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing changes in the fair value of our positions, and gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Trading revenues arise from transactions in cash instruments and derivatives in which we act as a market maker for our clients. In this role, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and&#8212;depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position&#8212;to hold those positions for a period of time; 

&#8226; building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory held to facilitate client activity through trades with other market participants; 

&#8226; managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between risks incurred from the facilitation of client transactions and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;

&#8226; trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and 

&#8226; engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets. 

In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Trading revenues primarily include revenues from customers&#8217; purchases and sales of fixed income instruments in which we act as principal, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. 

Investments 

Investments revenues are composed of realized and unrealized gains and losses derived from investments, including those associated with employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Estimates of the fair value of the investments that produce these revenues may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions, generally or in relation to specific transactions. 

Within the Institutional Securities segment, gains and losses are primarily from business-related investments. Certain investments are subject to sale restrictions. Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. 

Within the Investment Management business segment, Investments revenues, in addition to gains and losses from investments, include performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, a portion of which is subject to reversal. The business is entitled to receive carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us where revenues are primarily attributable to holders of noncontrolling interests. 

Commissions and Fees 

Commissions and fees result from arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for executing transactions related to securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of other products. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, commissions and fees include fees earned from market-making activities, such as executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC derivatives. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, commissions and fees primarily arise from client transactions 

in equity securities, insurance products, mutual funds, futures and options, and also include revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges, and market centers for execution . 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets and the distribution of funds and similar products. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Asset management revenues are associated with advisory services and management of assets, account service and administration, as well as distribution of products. These revenues are generally based on the net asset value of the account in which a client is invested. 

Within the Investment Management business segment, Asset management revenues are primarily composed of fees received from mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on certain products and separately managed accounts as a percentage of appreciation generally earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These performance fees are generally recognized annually. 

Net Interest 

Interest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities, Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits and Borrowings. 

Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Net interest is a function of market-making strategies, client activity, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Net interest is impacted by market-making activities as securities held by the Firm generally earn interest, as do securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell, while securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally incur interest expense. 

Within the Wealth Management business segment, Interest income is driven by Investment securities, Loans and margin loans. Interest expense is driven by Deposits and other funding. Upon acquisition, E*TRADE&#8217;s Investment securities were recorded at fair value, and the resulting premium will be amortized over the life of the portfolio against interest income. 

Other 

Other revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues and losses from equity method investments, lending

commitments, fees earned in association with lending activities and the provision for loan losses. 

Other revenues for Wealth Management are derived from realized gains and losses on AFS securities, the provision for loan losses, account handling fees, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues. 

Institutional Securities&#8212;Sales and Trading Revenues 

Sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues and Net interest. These revenues, which can be affected by a variety of interrelated factors, including market volumes, bid-offer spreads and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity, as well as the effect of hedging activity, are viewed in the aggregate when assessing the performance and profitability of our sales and trading activities. We make transaction-related decisions based on, among other things, an assessment of the aggregate expected profit or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, or net interest income, any costs associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses. 

Following is a description of the sales and trading activities within our equity and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items. 

Equity&#8212;Financing. We provide financing, prime brokerage and fund administration services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products, including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities lending products, and in Trading revenues for derivative products. Fees for providing fund administration services are reflected in Asset management revenues. 

Equity&#8212;Execution services. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC transactions. We make markets for our clients principally in equity-related securities and derivative products, including those that provide liquidity and are utilized for hedging. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory held to facilitate client activity, which are reflected in Trading revenues. 

Fixed income &#8212;Within fixed income, we make markets in various flow and structured products in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services: 

&#8226; Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses 

from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues. 

&#8226; Credit products. We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake lending activities, which include commercial mortgage lending, secured lending facilities and financing extended to sales and trading customers. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues. 

&#8226; Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and metals. Other activities primarily include results from the centralized management of our fixed income derivative counterparty exposures and managing derivative counterparty risk on behalf of clients. These activities are primarily recorded in Trading revenues. 

Other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains and losses on economic hedges related to certain borrowings, certain activities associated with corporate lending, as well as gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans. 

Compensation Expense 

Compensation and benefits expenses include base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, carried interest allocated to employees, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. 

The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from period to period, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, include base salary and benefits, and may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm&#8217;s, business unit&#8217;s and individual&#8217;s performance. 

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is recognized over the relevant vesting period and is adjusted based on the notional earnings of the referenced investments until distribution. Although changes in 

##TABLE_START December 2020 Form 10-K 32 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and the compensation expense recognized over the vesting period. 

Income Taxes 

The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

Investment Banking Revenues 

Investment banking revenues of $7,204 million in 2020 increased 26% compared with the prior year, reflecting strength in our underwriting businesses. 

&#8226; Advisory revenues decreased primarily due to fewer large completed transactions. 

&#8226; Equity underwriting revenues increased on higher volumes, primarily in secondary block share trades, initial public offerings and follow-on offerings. 

&#8226; Fixed income underwriting revenues increased on higher volumes, primarily in investment grade and non-investment grade bond issuances, partially offset by lower event-driven investment grade loan activity.

1. Includes Commissions and fees and Asset management revenues. 

2. Includes funding costs, which are allocated to the businesses based on funding usage. 

Equity 

Equity sales and trading net revenues of $9,801 million in 2020 increased 22% compared with the prior year, reflecting strong performance in both our execution services and financing businesses. 

&#8226; Financing revenues increased overall, primarily driven by client activity. In addition, changes in market rates and financing mix contributed to higher Net interest revenues and an offsetting reduction in Trading revenues. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues increased, primarily reflecting higher client activity and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in derivatives and cash equities. 

Fixed Income 

Fixed income net revenues of $8,824 million in 2020 increased 59% compared with the prior year, reflecting strong performance across all products. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues increased, primarily due to higher client activity in both rates and foreign exchange 

products and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues increased, primarily due to higher client activity in corporate credit and securitized products from higher volumes and wider bid-offer spreads, partially offset by the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity. Lower funding costs and higher average secured lending facilities balances contributed to higher Net interest revenues. 

&#8226; Commodities products and Other revenues increased, primarily reflecting the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity and higher client activity in Commodities, partially offset by lower client structuring activity within derivative counterparty credit risk management. 

Other 

&#8226; Other sales and trading revenues of $167 million in 2020 increased 80% compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting gains on hedges associated with corporate lending activity compared with losses in the prior year, partially offset by lower rates on liquidity investments. 

Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses and Income Tax Items 

Investments 

&#8226; Net investment gains of $166 million in 2020 decreased 49% compared with the prior year primarily due to the absence of a gain associated with an investment&#8217;s initial public offering. 

Other Revenues 

&#8226; Other net losses were $214 million in 2020 compared with Other revenues of $632 million in the prior year. This change was primarily as a result of mark-to-market losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale in the current year, as credit spreads widened, compared with gains in the prior year, as well as an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment in the current year. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $16,797 million in 2020 increased 13% compared with the prior year, reflecting a 12% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses and a 13% increase in Non-compensation expenses compared with the prior year. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily due to increases in discretionary incentive compensation, driven by higher revenues. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily reflecting higher volume-related expenses and an increase in the provision for credit losses for lending commitments.

Transactional revenues of $3,694 million in 2020 increased 24% compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of higher Commissions and fees and higher Trading revenues. 

&#8226; Trading revenues increased in 2020, primarily due to gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, partially offset by lower fixed income revenues. 

&#8226; Commissions and fees increased in 2020, primarily due to increased client activity in equities, as well as order flow payments as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

Asset Management 

Asset management revenues of $10,955 million in 2020 increased 7% compared with the prior year, due to higher fee-based asset levels in 2020 as a result of market appreciation and positive fee-based net flows, partially offset by lower average fee rates. 

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $4,022 million in 2020 decreased 5% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the net effect of lower interest rates, partially offset by growth in bank lending and increases in investment portfolio balances driven by higher brokerage sweep deposits, as well as incremental Net interest as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $14,668 million in 2020 increased 14% compared with the prior year, due to higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, driven by higher compensable revenues, incremental compensation as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition and integration-related expenses of $151 million, as well as higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily due to incremental operating and other expenses as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition, integration-related expenses of $80 million, a regulatory charge in the third quarter of 2020 and 

$52 million of E*TRADE-related intangible assets amortization. Partially offsetting these increases was lower marketing and business development expenses.

Asset management revenues of $3,013 million in 2020 increased 15% compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher average AUM, driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows. 

See &#8220;Assets Under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $2,864 million in 2020 increased 3% compared with the prior year as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses, partially offset by lower Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily as a result of lower compensation associated with carried interest, partially offset by increases in discretionary incentive compensation driven by higher Asset management revenues and higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased primarily as a result of higher fee sharing paid to intermediaries on higher average AUM.

Planned Acquisition of Eaton Vance 

On October 8, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Eaton Vance, a leading provider of advanced investment management strategies and wealth management solutions, in a cash and stock transaction valued, as of the announcement, at approximately $7 billion, based on the 3-day volume-weighted average price of our common stock prior to October 7, 2020 and the number of Eaton Vance&#8217;s fully diluted shares outstanding on October 7, 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, Eaton Vance common stockholders will receive $28.25 in cash and 0.5833 shares of our common shares for each Eaton Vance common share. In addition, Eaton Vance common shareholders as of December 4, 2020 received a one-time special cash dividend of $4.25 per share on December 18, 2020, which was paid by Eaton Vance. We currently expect to complete the acquisition on March 1, 2021. Completion of the transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions.

The increase in the Firm&#8217;s effective tax rate in 2020 compared with the prior year is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. In 2020, net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards. 

The Firm&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2019 includes net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits related to conversion of employee share-based awards.

Other Matters 

Deferred Cash-Based Compensation 

The Firm sponsors a number of employee deferred cash-based compensation programs, which generally contain vesting, clawback and cancellation provisions. For the 2020 performance year, deferred cash-based compensation was awarded to a reduced group of eligible employees compared with the prior year. Additionally in 2020, certain changes to our compensation deferral formula resulted in less cash-based compensation being deferred. 

Employees are permitted to allocate the value of their deferred awards among a menu of notional investments, whereby the value of their awards will track the performance of the referenced notional investments. The menu of investments, which is selected by the Firm, includes fixed income, equity, commodity and money market funds. 

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 

The Firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments 

##TABLE_START December 2020 Form 10-K 42 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

are recorded in Trading and Investments revenues. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm&#8217;s investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference is generally not material to Income from continuing operations before income taxes in any individual period, it may impact Firm reported ratios ( e.g., the Expense efficiency ratio) in certain periods. At December 31, 2020, substantially all employee notional investments that subjected the Firm to price risk were hedged.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates, which we have either determined are not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 

Fair Value 

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value 

A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. We make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; Trading assets and Trading liabilities; 

&#8226; Investment Securities&#8212;AFS; 

&#8226; Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell; 

&#8226; Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit; 

&#8226; Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; 

##TABLE_START 43 

December 2020 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; Certain Other secured financings; and 

&#8226; Certain Borrowings. 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e. , the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. 

In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the definition of fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements. 

Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill 

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 

For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is 

less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed. 

When performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 

The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value. 

Intangible Assets 

Amortizable intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, or in the situation where acquired as part of a business combination, at the fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of accounting. Subsequently, they are carried in the balance sheets at amortized cost, where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives. 

When certain events or circumstances exist, amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows. 

The initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of impairment assessments are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. These inputs include, but are not limited to, forecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates. 

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods. 

See Notes 2, 3 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.

Legal and Regulatory Contingencies 

In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. 

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. 

We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. 

Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. 

In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. 

Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals. 

See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on legal contingencies. 

Income Taxes 

We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. 

Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years&#8217; examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. 

Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. 

Our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. 

Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. 

Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of

a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. 

See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 22 to the financial statements for additional information on our tax examinations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;), establishes and maintains our liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Balance Sheet 

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables. In the Institutional Securities business segment, these arise from sales and trading activities, and in the Wealth Management business segment, these arise from banking activities, including management of the investment portfolio, comprising Investment securities, Cash and cash equivalents and Securities purchased under agreements to resell. Total assets increased to $1,116 billion at December 31, 2020 compared with $895 billion at December 31, 2019. 

Wealth Management&#8217;s assets increased primarily from the acquisition of E*TRADE, as well as growth in Loans and increases in the investment portfolio as a result of significantly higher deposits. 

Institutional Securities&#8217; assets were also higher, reflecting increases within Customer and other receivables, principally within Equity financing, and Trading assets, primarily U.S. Treasury and agency securities. 

Liquidity Risk Management Framework 

The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies. 

The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework: 

&#8226; Sufficient Liquidity Resources should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows; 

&#8226; Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding; 

&#8226; Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and 

##TABLE_START December 2020 Form 10-K 46 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding. 

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. 

Required Liquidity Framework 

Our Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level. 

Liquidity Stress Tests 

We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework. 

The assumptions used by us in our various Liquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; No government support; 

&#8226; No access to equity and unsecured debt markets; 

&#8226; Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon; 

&#8226; Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding; 

&#8226; Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades; 

&#8226; Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral; 

&#8226; Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks; 

&#8226; Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and 

&#8226; Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions. 

Liquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels, including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its 

subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities. 

At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we maintained sufficient Liquidity Resources to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Liquidity Resources 

We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (&#8220;Liquidity Resources&#8221;) to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The total amount of Liquidity Resources is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. 

The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk tolerance and is subject to change depending on market and Firm-specific events. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

1. In the first quarter of 2020, we changed our internal measure of liquidity from the Global Liquidity Reserve to Liquidity Resources, which is more closely aligned with the regulatory definition of HQLA. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. 

Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. Liquidity Resources increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in deposits, including incremental deposits as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

Regulatory Liquidity Framework 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

The Firm, MSBNA and MSPBNA are required to comply with, and subject to a transition period, ETB will be required to comply with, LCR requirements, including a requirement to calculate each entity&#8217;s LCR on each business day. The requirements are designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Firm, MSBNA and MSPBNA are compliant with the minimum required LCR of 100%.

1. Under the LCR rule, Eligible HQLA is calculated using weightings and excluding certain HQLA held in subsidiaries. 

2. Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The U.S. banking agencies have finalized a rule to implement the NSFR, which requires large banking organizations to maintain sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year time horizon, and will apply to us, MSBNA, MSPBNA and ETB. These requirements become effective on July 1, 2021 and we will be in compliance with the final rule by the effective date. 

Funding Management 

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. 

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. 

Secured Financing 

The liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded. 

We have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. 

##TABLE_START December 2020 Form 10-K 48 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our Liquidity Resources against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities. 

We generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which takes into account HQLA classifications consistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory requirements, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.

In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheets, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheets. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies and the elements of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework. 

Unsecured Financing 

We view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding for unencumbered securities and non-security assets. Our unsecured financings include borrowings and certificates of deposit carried at fair value, which are primarily composed of: 

instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. As part of our asset/liability management strategy, when appropriate, we use derivatives to make adjustments to the interest rate risk profile of our borrowings (see Notes 7 and 14 to the financial statements).

1. Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, remaining maturity represents the earliest put date. 

Borrowings of $217 billion as of December 31, 2020 increased compared with $193 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of issuances net of maturities and redemptions, as well as fair value adjustments. 

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby

mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. 

The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings in the ordinary course of business. 

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 14 to the financial statements. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. These include regulatory or legislative changes, the macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support, among other things. See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; Liquidity Risk.&#8221;

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 

In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Capital Management 

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework 

We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, see Note 17 to the financial statements. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For additional information on TLAC, see &#8220;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; herein.

3. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5% but is currently set by the U.S. banking agencies at zero. 

4. The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Beginning October 1, 2020, our Standardized Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our Advanced Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to our 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB. 

5. Required ratios under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement. 

Risk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following: 

&#8226; Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us; 

&#8226; Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and 

&#8226; Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). 

Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA (&#8220;Standardized Approach&#8221;) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (&#8220;Advanced Approach&#8221;). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. 

Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier 1 leverage ratio and an SLR. We are required to maintain an SLR of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%. 

As of December 31, 2020, our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period. For further information, see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8221; herein.

1. Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions. 

3. Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures. 

4. Based on a Federal Reserve interim final rule in effect until March 31, 2021, our SLR and Supplementary leverage exposure as of December 31, 2020 reflect the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. As of December 31, 2020, the impact of the interim final rule on our SLR was an increase of 80 bps.

Regulatory VaR&#8212;VaR for regulatory capital requirements 

1. Amounts reflect assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of exposures and unsettled transactions, as applicable. 

Credit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily from an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. The increase was also driven by Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments and an increase in Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value gains. In addition, credit risk RWA under the Advanced Approach increased for CVA, mainly due to increased exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility. 

Market risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher market volatility. 

The decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach in 2020 reflects a decline in the frequency and severity of litigation-related losses. 

G-SIB Capital Surcharge 

We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIB&#8217;s size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity and substitutability, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee (&#8220;Method 1&#8221;). The second method uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (&#8220;Method 2&#8221;) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements 

The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (&#8220;covered BHCs&#8221;), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk&#8221;). 

These TLAC and eligible LTD requirements include various restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued by the covered BHC and be unsecured; have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an asset, entity or index, or a similar feature. In addition, the requirements provide permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law. 

A covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA or (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its SLR). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company, or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.

1. Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers. The final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD. 

3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date. 

Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements of the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external debt with an original maturity of less than one year or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including those with certain embedded features noted above, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHC&#8217;s outstanding external TLAC amount. We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of December 31, 2020. 

Additionally, the U.S. banking agencies have issued a final rule that, among other things, modifies the regulatory capital framework for large U.S. banking organizations, including us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. Under the final rule, such organizations are required to make certain deductions from regulatory capital for their investments in certain unsecured debt instruments (including eligible LTD in the TLAC framework) issued by the Parent Company and other G-SIBs. These requirements become effective on April 1, 2021, and we expect to be in compliance with the final rule by the effective date. 

Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual CCAR framework. 

We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal 

Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements. 

The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution ( i.e. , payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, and how we will serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us. 

In 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing applicable regulatory capital requirements. The final rule, which applies to certain BHCs, including us, introduced an SCB and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes. The final rule does not change regulatory capital requirements under the Advanced Approach, the Tier 1 leverage ratio or the SLR. However, failure to meet Advanced Approach or SLR regulatory capital requirements, inclusive of applicable capital buffers, would also result in automatic capital distribution limitations. 

The SCB applies only with respect to Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements and replaces the existing Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The SCB is the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the four quarters of planned common stock dividends divided by the projected RWAs from the quarter in which the Firm&#8217;s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test and (ii) 2.5%. 

Under the SCB final rule, the supervisory stress test now assumes that BHCs generally maintain a constant level of assets and RWAs throughout the projection period. In addition, it no longer assumes that BHCs make all planned capital distributions, although the SCB incorporates the amount of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. Similarly, the final rule eliminates the annual process in which the Federal Reserve provided its objection or non-objection to a firm&#8217;s capital plan, given the integration of stress test results into automatic distribution limitations resulting from failure to meet SCB requirements. Federal Reserve approval for capital actions is still required in some specific circumstances.

A firm&#8217;s SCB is subject to revision each year, with effect from October 1, to reflect the results of the Federal Reserve's annual supervisory stress test. The Federal Reserve has discretion to recalculate a firm's SCB outside of the October 1 annual cycle in certain circumstances. 

We submitted our 2020 Capital Plan (&#8220;Capital Plan&#8221;) and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 6, 2020. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its supervisory stress tests of each large BHC. On June 29, 2020, we disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website. On September 4, 2020, we announced we would be subject to an SCB of 5.7% beginning October 1, 2020, which reflects the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2020 supervisory stress test results, inclusive of corrections from the original results announced in June 2020. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this revised SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 required ratio of 13.2%. 

In 2020, the Federal Reserve required all large BHCs to update and resubmit their capital plans in response to changes in financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 2, 2020, we resubmitted our 2020 Capital Plan and company-run stress test results based on revised scenarios released by the Federal Reserve on September 17, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve published summary results of the second round of supervisory stress tests for each large BHC, including us. While the Federal Reserve did not recalculate any BHC&#8217;s SCB in connection with the December 18, 2020 announcement, it extended the time period to notify firms whether their SCB requirements will be recalculated until March 31, 2021, and also extended capital action supervisory restrictions applicable to large BHCs into the first quarter of 2021 with modifications to permit resumptions of share repurchases. Consistent with these modifications, on December 18, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchases of outstanding common stock of up to $10 billion in 2021, subject to limitations on distributions from the Federal Reserve. See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Capital Action Supervisory Restrictions&#8221; herein for additional information on capital action supervisory restrictions. 

For the 2021 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2021. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us, by June 30, 2021. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. 

Capital Action Supervisory Restrictions 

The Federal Reserve announced, on June 25, 2020, that all large BHCs would be subject to capital action supervisory restrictions beginning in the third quarter of 2020, which the Federal Reserve subsequently extended into the fourth quarter of 2020. Except as noted below, these restrictions generally prohibited large BHCs from making any capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve, regardless of whether a firm met applicable capital buffers, including the SCB. Large BHCs were, however, authorized to make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans; provided that a BHC did not increase the amount of its common stock dividends, to pay common stock dividends that did not exceed an amount equal to the average of the BHC&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve; and to make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. 

Under the modified capital action restrictions announced on December 18, 2020, large BHCs are permitted, in the first quarter of 2021, to take certain capital actions. In particular, a firm may, provided that it does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends to be larger than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020, pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters; make share repurchases that equal the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation; and redeem and make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. 

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 

Our required capital (&#8220;Required Capital&#8221;) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment&#8217;s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs ( e.g. , acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory

2. Total average common equity and the allocation to the Wealth Management business segment were revised in the fourth quarter of 2020 to reflect the impact of the E*TRADE acquisition on October 2, 2020. 

Beginning in 2021, we have updated our Required Capital framework to take into account changes to our risk-based capital requirements resulting from the SCB. The stand-alone impact of the change to the Required Capital framework was not material to the business segments. As noted above, common equity attribution to the business segments is based upon usage. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of other future regulatory requirements as appropriate. 

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Our next resolution plan submission will be a targeted resolution plan in July 2021. 

As described in our most recent resolution plan, which was submitted on June 28, 2019, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Funding IHC&#8221;). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its Contributable Assets to our material entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our material entities or before putting U.S. taxpayers at risk. 

The obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the Funding IHC. As a result, claims of our material entities, including the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company. 

In December 2019, we received joint feedback on our 2019 resolution plan from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The feedback confirmed that there are no deficiencies in our 2019 resolution plan and that we had successfully addressed a prior shortcoming identified by the agencies in the review of our 2017 resolution plan. The agencies noted one shortcoming in our 2019 resolution plan related to certain mechanisms intended to facilitate our SPOE strategy which must be addressed prior to our next resolution plan submission in 2021. 

For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Financial Holding Company&#8212;Resolution and Recovery Planning&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.&#8221; 

Regulatory Developments 

Regulatory Developments in Response to COVID-19 

In the United States, the Federal Reserve, the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies and Congress have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from COVID-19. 

Federal Reserve and other U.S. Banking Agency Actions 

The Federal Reserve established a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the Federal Reserve has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets or debt instruments from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. In the current year, we have participated as principal, as well as on behalf of clients, in certain of these facilities and programs, and we may participate in other of these facilities and programs in the future. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve has taken a range of other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, the Federal Reserve has set the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25% and has increased its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, purchased agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, and established a facility to purchase corporate debt securities and shares of exchange-

traded funds holding such securities. The Federal Reserve has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowings by 150 basis points to 0.25% while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. In addition, reserve requirements have been reduced to zero. 

Acting in concert with the other U.S. banking agencies, the Federal Reserve has also issued statements encouraging banking organizations to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they lend to households and businesses affected by COVID-19. 

Further, the Federal Reserve, along with the other U.S. banking agencies, issued guidance stating that granting certain concessions to borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, generally would not be considered TDRs under applicable U.S. GAAP. This guidance also clarifies that efforts to work with borrowers of one-to-four family residential mortgages impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and meeting certain criteria will not result in such loans being deemed restructured or modified for purposes of regulatory capital requirements. 

The Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking agencies have also issued a series of rulemakings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including to facilitate banking organizations&#8217; use of their capital buffers: 

&#8226; Supplementary Leverage Ratio Interim Final Rules. The Federal Reserve has adopted an interim final rule that excludes, on a temporary basis, U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from our supplementary leverage exposure from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. 

A similar interim final rule issued by the OCC along with the other U.S. banking agencies provides national banks, including MSBNA and MSPBNA, an optional election, which is considered on a case-by-case basis by the OCC if received after June 30, 2020, to apply similar relief. If elected and approved, a national bank must receive prior approval from the OCC before making any capital distributions while the exclusion is in effect. As of December 31, 2020, neither MSBNA nor MSPBNA made this optional election. 

&#8226; Revisions to Definition of Eligible Retained Income. The U.S. banking agencies have adopted as final an interim final rule, which was effective March 20, 2020, amending the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules. As amended, eligible retained income is defined by the U.S. banking agencies as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters. This definition applies 

with respect to any payout restrictions applicable in the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, including any applicable CCyB, G-SIB capital surcharge, capital conservation buffer, the enhanced SLR and the SCB, which replaced the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Approach. 

Separately, the Federal Reserve has adopted as final an interim final rule, which was effective March 26, 2020, amending the definition of eligible retained income under its TLAC rule to be consistent with the revised definition of eligible retained income in the regulatory capital framework, as summarized above. 

&#8226; Regulatory Capital and Stress Testing Developments Related to Implementation of CECL. The U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final rule, consistent with an interim final rule that was effective March 31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital and TLAC requirements, the required adoption time period for CECL. We have elected to apply a transition method provided by the rule, under which the effects of CECL on our regulatory capital and TLAC requirements are deferred for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in of the aggregate capital effects of the two-year deferral. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the &#8220;Consolidated Appropriations Act&#8221;) 

The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury had the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds may also have been used to support the several Federal Reserve programs and facilities described in &#8220;Federal Reserve Actions&#8221; previously or additional programs or facilities that are established by the Federal Reserve under its Section 13(3) authority and meet certain criteria. Among other provisions, the CARES Act also included funding for the Small Business Administration to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications not to be categorized as TDRs and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. 

The CARES Act also included several measures that temporarily adjusted existing laws or regulations. These included providing the FDIC with additional authority to guarantee the deposits of solvent insured depository institutions held in non-interest-bearing business transaction accounts to a maximum amount specified by the FDIC, reinstating the FDIC&#8217;s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Authority to guarantee debt obligations of solvent insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, temporarily allowing the U.S. Treasury to fully guarantee money market mutual funds and granting additional

##TABLE_END

authority to the OCC to provide certain exemptions to the lending limits imposed on national banks. 

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020, extends certain relief provided by the CARES Act while also modifying or clarifying certain other provisions. Among other amendments to the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act extends the relief related to TDRs until January 1, 2022. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act rescinds certain funds that were appropriated to the U.S. Treasury to provide loans, loan guarantees, and make other investments in programs or facilities established by the Federal Reserve, and prohibits the Federal Reserve, after December 31, 2020, from making any new investments, loans or loan guarantees, or extensions of credit through those of its programs and facilities that were established using CARES Act funding. Federal Reserve programs and facilities that were not established using CARES Act funding are not affected by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. 

Non-U.S. Central Bank Actions 

In addition to actions taken by the Federal Reserve, many non-U.S. central banks have announced similar facilities and programs in response to the economic and market disruptions associated with COVID-19. Firm subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. markets may participate, or perform customer facilitation roles, in such non-U.S. facilities or programs. 

Other Matters 

U.K. Withdrawal from the E.U. 

On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. under the terms of a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the E.U. The withdrawal agreement provided for a transition period to the end of December 2020, during which time the U.K. continued to apply E.U. law as if it were a member state, and U.K. firms&#8217; rights to provide financial services in E.U. member states continued. 

On December 24, 2020 the U.K. and the E.U. announced they had reached agreement on the terms of a trade and co-operation agreement to govern the future relationship between the parties. The agreement consists of three main pillars including trade, citizens&#8217; security and governance, covering a range of arrangements in several areas. The agreement is provisionally applicable with effect from January 1, 2021 pending formal ratification by the E.U. As anticipated, the agreement did not materially address provision of financial services. 

We had prepared the structure of our European operations for a range of potential outcomes, including for the possibility that U.K. financial firms&#8217; access to E.U. markets after the transition period would be limited, and have been able to continue to serve our clients and customers from January 1, 2021. 

For more information on the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the E.U., our related preparations and the potential impact on our operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;International Risk.&#8221; For further information regarding our exposure to the U.K., see also &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Country and Other Risks&#8221; herein. 

Planned Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rates 

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the &#8220;IBORs&#8221;). There remains a likelihood that most IBORs will not be available beyond 2021. In 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR publication, issued a consultation requesting feedback on its intention to cease the publication of most LIBOR rates as of the end of December 2021, except for the publication until June 30, 2023 of the most widely used U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors. At the same time, the U.S. banking agencies and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority also encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing LIBOR as soon as practicable and no later than December 31, 2021, but have also indicated their support for the continuation of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors through the end of June 2023 to allow for certain U.S. dollar LIBOR legacy contracts to mature. 

Also in 2020, there have been several steps taken by the industry to encourage the transition to alternative reference rates. Key central clearinghouses, such as London Clearing House (&#8220;LCH&#8221;) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;CME&#8221;), have switched their price aligned interest and discounting to the alternative reference rates. For example, the LCH and CME transitioned the discounting rate for U.S. dollar denominated products to SOFR, the alternative rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR selected by the ARRC. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) also published its 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol which will amend ISDA&#8217;s interest rate definitions among Protocol adherents to incorporate robust fallbacks for legacy non-cleared derivatives linked to LIBOR and certain other interest rates benchmarks. The ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol became effective as of January 25, 2021 and applies to Protocol adherents who do not elect to voluntarily convert their derivatives contracts to reference alternative rates in advance of the applicable cessation date. Similarly, ISDA&#8217;s IBOR Fallbacks Supplement will also amend ISDA&#8217;s standard definitions to incorporate these new fallbacks in new derivatives entered into on or after that same effective date. In addition, certain central bank-sponsored committees have issued recommended best practices to assist market participants in transitioning away from the IBORs in various jurisdictions, including the United States. These documents include recommended timelines and intermediate steps market participants can take in order to achieve a successful transition.

Management's Discussion and Analysis 

##TABLE_END

We have established and are undertaking a Firm-wide IBOR transition plan to promote the transition to alternative reference rates, which is overseen by a global steering committee, with senior management oversight. Our transition plan is designed to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of one or more of the IBORs, and includes continued engagement with central bank and industry working groups and regulators (including participation and leadership on key committees), active client engagement, internal operational readiness and risk management, among other things. We are a party to a significant number of LIBOR-linked contracts, many of which extend beyond 2021 and, in the case of U.S. dollar LIBOR, June 30, 2023, composed of derivatives, securitizations, floating rate notes, loans and mortgages. Our review of these contracts includes assessing the impact of applicable fallbacks and any amendments that may be warranted or appropriate. We are also taking steps to update operational processes (including to support alternative reference rates), models, and associated infrastructure, as well as conducting certain client outreach to amend fallbacks, including by utilization of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol or through bilaterally negotiated voluntary conversions of outstanding LIBOR products where practicable. Key Firm entities have also adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol. 

In addition, as part of the transition to alternative reference rates, we are making markets in products linked to such rates, including SOFR, and have issued debt linked to SOFR. 

For a further discussion of the expected replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks, and the related risks and our transition plan, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.&#8221;
