>Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report and our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this report.

OVERVIEW

We are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems and surgical products with an emphasis on women's health and well-being through early detection and treatment. We sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. Until December 30, 2019, our product portfolio included aesthetic and medical treatments systems sold by our former Medical Aesthetic business. We completed the sale of our Medical Aesthetics segment on December 30, 2019 (the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2020).

Through our Diagnostics segment, we offer a wide range of diagnostic products, which are used primarily to aid in the screening and diagnosis of human diseases. Our primary Diagnostics products include our molecular diagnostic assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (Panther, Panther Fusion and Tigris), our ThinPrep cytology system, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test. Our Aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays is used to detect, among other things, the infectious microorganisms that cause common sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV, and

 Trichomonas vaginalis

, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis. In addition, in 2017 and 2018 we introduced the Aptima quantitative viral load tests for HIV, Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B. Our assay portfolio also includes diagnostic tests for a range of acute respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, as well as a test for the detection of Group B Streptococcus, or GBS, that are run on the Panther Fusion system, a field upgradeable instrument addition to the base Panther system. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, we developed and launched the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (which runs on our standard Panther system) and the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (which runs on our Panther Fusion system). The ThinPrep System is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. In January 2017, we sold our blood screening business to Grifols. We have continued to provide Grifols with instrumentation and certain raw materials, manufacture assays, and perform research and development services to support the blood screening business Grifols acquired from us.

Our Breast Health segment offers a broad portfolio of solutions for breast cancer care for radiology, pathology and surgery. These solutions include breast imaging and analytics, such as our 2D and 3D digital mammography systems and reading workstations, minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems and devices, breast biopsy site markers and localization, specimen radiology, ultrasound and connectivity solutions and breast conserving surgery products. Our most advanced breast imaging platforms, Selenia Dimensions and 3Dimensions, utilize a technology called tomosynthesis to produce 3D images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast, which we refer to as the Genius 3D Mammography exam, as well as conventional 2D full field digital mammography images. Our clinical results for FDA approval demonstrated that conventional 2D digital mammography with the addition of 3D tomosynthesis is superior to 2D digital mammography alone for both screening and diagnostics for women of all ages and breast densities. With the acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we now offer premium ultrasound imaging, further connecting Hologic capabilities across the continuum of breast care from screening to diagnosis and treatment. 

Our GYN Surgical products include our NovaSure Endometrial Ablation System, or NovaSure, and our MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System, or MyoSure, as well as our Fluent Fluid Management system, or Fluent. The NovaSure portfolio is comprised of the NovaSure CLASSIC and NovaSure ADVANCED devices and involves a trans-cervical procedure for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. The MyoSure suite of devices offers four options to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus. The Fluent system is a fluid management system that provides liquid distention during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures.

Our Skeletal Health segment's products includes the Horizon DXA, a dual energy x-ray system, which evaluates bone density and performs body composition assessments, and the Fluoroscan Insight FD mini C-arm, which assists in performing minimally invasive orthopedic surgical procedures on a patient's extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle.

Our Medical Aesthetics segment consisted of a portfolio of aesthetic treatment systems. We completed the sale of our Medical Aesthetics business on December 30, 2019.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, Hologic or our company refer to Hologic, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

COVID-19 Considerations

The pandemic caused by the spread of the novel strain of coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19") has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in the markets we sell our products into, primarily the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific. In the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, the spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally. As healthcare systems respond to the increasing demands of managing COVID-19 and the resulting economic uncertainties, governments around the world have imposed measures designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, and individuals are responding to the fears of contracting COVID-19. In particular, elective procedures and exams have been and continue to be delayed or cancelled, there has been a significant reduction in physician office visits, and hospitals have postponed or canceled capital purchases as well as limited or eliminated services, however in the second half of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we started to see a recovery of elective procedures and exams, which continued into the fourth quarter. The reductions in testing and procedures have had, and we believe will continue to have, a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. However, the impact of the commercial release of our COVID-19 assays more than offset these negative impacts as we generated significant revenue from the sales of these assays in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020.The negative effects of COVID-19 and the associated economic disruptions were felt primarily beginning in the second half of March in many of our end-markets and earlier in Asia, primarily China, and the impact to our legacy products in the third fiscal quarter was significant. The impact to our legacy products was less severe in the fourth quarter.

While our results of operations and cash flows in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 were positively impacted by the sale of our COVID-19 assays, the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the future. The factors that could create such adverse impact include: the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; continued demand for COVID-19 testing; competition from existing and new COVID-19 testing technologies and products; the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and international healthcare systems, the U.S. economy and worldwide economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of U.S. and international governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions.

In addition to adversely affecting demand for our products, other than our COVID-19 assays, COVID-19 and associated economic disruptions could continue to have an adverse impact on our supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments have taken and will take. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We believe that the uncertainty surrounding global financial markets and deteriorating worldwide macroeconomic conditions resulting from the pandemic have caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Additionally, the pandemic has caused and may further cause constrictions in world credit markets that have caused and could cause our customers to experience increased difficulty in paying their existing obligations to us or in securing the financing necessary to purchase our products. Economic uncertainty has resulted and may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness, which may also continue to adversely affect demand for our products (other than our COVID-19 assays).

As we assessed the potential longer term economic and capital market uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, at the end of March 2020 we suspended our accounts receivable securitization program and borrowed $750.0 million under our revolver. We used $250.0 million of these proceeds to pay off all amounts then owed under our accounts receivable securitization agreement, and retained the balance as cash reserve. As of the end of fiscal 2020, the Company repaid $500.0 million of the $750.0 million borrowed under its revolver. As of September 26, 2020 the Company had an additional $1.25 billion available under its revolver and $701.0 million of cash on hand.

In response to the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business, in April 2020 we initiated cost-cutting measures, which included not only reducing discretionary and variable spend, such as travel, marketing programs and the use of contractors, consultants and temporary help, but we also implemented employee furloughs, salary cuts primarily in the U.S., reduced hours and in certain instances, employee terminations. Further, in April 2020, we shut down certain manufacturing facilities temporarily and implemented reduced work-week schedules in response to lower near-term demand for many of our products. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, substantially all of the Company's employee cost-cutting measures ceased, and the majority of the impacted manufacturing facilities were back to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.

We have also taken measures to ensure the safety of our employees and to comply with governmental orders. These measures could require that our employees continue to work remotely or otherwise refrain from reporting to their normal workplace for extended periods of time, which in turn could result in a decrease in our commercial and marketing activities.

Acquisitions and Disposition

The following sets forth a description of certain of our acquisitions and dispositions

 

in our last three fiscal years:

Acquisitions

Acessa Health

On August 23, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Acessa Health, Inc., or Acessa for a purchase price of $161.3 million, which included a hold-back of $3.0 million payable up to 5 months from the date of acquisition, and contingent consideration, which we estimated at $81.8 million as of the measurement date. Acessa, located in Austin, Texas, manufactures and markets its Acessa ProVu system, a laparoscopic radio frequency ablation system for use in treatment of uterine fibroids. The contingent consideration is based on annual incremental revenue growth over a three-year period ending annually in December. The contingent consideration is payable after each annual measurement period. Based on our preliminary purchase price allocation, we have allocated $128.2 million of the purchase price to the preliminary value of intangible assets and $48.4 million to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as we continue to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities. Acessa's results of operations are reported in our Surgical segment from the date of acquisition.

Health Beacons

On February 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Health Beacons, Inc., or Health Beacons, for a purchase price of $19.7 million, which included hold-backs of $2.3 million that are payable up to 18 months from the date of acquisition. Health Beacons manufactures the LOCalizer product. Based on our preliminary valuation, we have allocated $10.7 million of the purchase price to the preliminary value of developed technology and $6.2 million to goodwill. The remaining $2.8 million of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired tangible assets and liabilities. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as we continue to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities. Health Beacon's results of operations are reported in our Breast Health reportable segment from the date of acquisition. 

Alpha Imaging

On December 30, 2019, we completed the acquisition of assets from Alpha Imaging, LLC, or Alpha Imaging, for a purchase price of $18.0 million, which included a hold-back of $1.0 million and contingent consideration estimated at $0.9 million. The contingent consideration was payable upon shipment of certain backlog orders entered into by Alpha Imaging prior to the acquisition. Alpha Imaging was a long-standing distributor of our Breast and Skeletal products in the U.S. Based on our preliminary valuation, the majority of the purchase price was allocated to a customer relationships intangible asset. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as we continue to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities.

SuperSonic Imagine

On August 1, 2019, we acquired approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of SuperSonic Imagine S. A., or SSI. SSI, headquartered in France, specializes in ultrasound imaging and designs, develops and markets an ultrasound platform used in the non-invasive care path for the characterization of breast, liver or prostate diseases. We initially accounted for this investment as an equity method investment.

On November 21, 2019, we acquired an additional 7.6 million common shares of SSI for $12.6 million. As a result, we owned approximately 78% of the outstanding common shares of SSI at November 21, 2019 and controlled SSI's voting interest and operations. We performed purchase accounting as of November 21, 2019 and beginning on that date the financial results of SSI are included within our consolidated financial statements, specifically within our Breast Health segment. We remeasured the initial investment of 46% of the outstanding shares of SSI to its fair value at the acquisition date, resulting in a gain of $3.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The total purchase price was $69.3 million, which consisted of $17.9 million for the equity method investment in SSI, $12.6 million for shares acquired on November 21, 2019, $30.2 million for loans we provided to SSI prior to the acquisition that are considered forgiven, and $8.6 million representing the fair value of the noncontrolling interests as of November 21, 2019. Based on our preliminary purchase price allocation, we have allocated $45.3 million of the purchase price to the preliminary value of intangible assets and $34.3 million to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as we continue to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities, primarily income taxes and recognition of uncertain tax positions, to finalize the purchase price allocation. 

As of September 26, 2020, we owned approximately 81% of SSI, and accordingly we have recorded an adjustment to our net income for the non-controlling interest we do not own of $4.7 million in the current year.

Focal Therapeutics

On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Focal Therapeutics, Inc., or Focal, for a purchase price of $120.1 million, which included hold-backs of $14.0 million payable up to one year from the date of acquisition. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, $1.5 million of the hold-back was paid, and the remaining $12.5 million was paid on October 1, 2019. Focal, headquartered in California, manufactures and markets its BioZorb marker, which is an implantable three-dimensional marker that helps clinicians overcome certain challenges in breast conserving surgery. Based on our valuation, we allocated $97.2 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $31.1 million to goodwill. Focal's results of operations are reported in our Breast Health reportable segment from the date of acquisition. 

Faxitron

On July 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Faxitron Bioptics, LLC, or Faxitron, for a purchase price of $89.5 million, which included hold-backs of $11.7 million that were payable up to one year from the date of acquisition, and contingent consideration, which we estimated at $2.9 million as of the measurement date. The contingent consideration was payable upon meeting certain revenue growth metrics. In fiscal 2019, the continent consideration liability was increased, and we paid $5.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, we paid $6.5 million of the hold-back and withheld the remaining $5.2 million under the indemnification provisions of the purchase agreement, which the former shareholders had disputed. We resolved this dispute in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and made a $4.1 million payment to the former shareholders. Based on our valuation, we allocated $53.2 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $45.6 million to goodwill. Faxitron, headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, develops, manufactures, and markets digital radiography systems. Faxitron's results of operations are reported in our Breast Health reportable segment from the date of acquisition.

Emsor, S.A.

On December 11, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Emsor S.A., or Emsor, a distributor of our Breast and Skeletal Health products in Spain and Portugal, for a purchase price of $16.3 million, which included contingent consideration estimated at $4.9 million as of the measurement date. The contingent consideration was payable upon Emsor achieving predefined amounts of cumulative revenue over a two-year period from the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

Disposition

On December 30, 2019, we completed the sale of our Medical Aesthetics business to Clayton Dubilier & Rice ("CD&R"). At the closing, the Company received cash proceeds of $153.4 million. The sales price was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the Company paid $3.4 million, resulting in a final sales price of $150.0 million. As a result of the sale, we recorded a $30.2 million impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to record the asset group at fair value less costs to dispose as it met the assets held-for-sale criteria. For additional information, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Following the sale of our Medical Aesthetics business, we have not received any further product revenue related to this business, although additional expenses will be incurred primarily in connection with the indemnification of legal and tax matters that existed as of the date of disposition. In addition, we agreed to provide transition services for a period of up to 15 months.

We generated a 16.4% increase in product revenues in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the increase in the Diagnostics business from sales of our newly introduced COVID-19 assays that were partially offset by reduced sales of our legacy products. We had decreases in our Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health segments which we attribute primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across our businesses. We disposed of the Medical Aesthetics business segment on December 30, 2019, the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2020, and generated no Medical Aesthetics revenue after that sale.

Diagnostics product revenues increased 75.8% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in Molecular Diagnostics (excluding blood screening) of $965.6 million, partially offset by decreases in Cytology & Perinatal of $62.7 million and a decrease of $9.0 million in blood screening. While we divested our blood screening business in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we continue to provide long-term access to Panther instrumentation and certain supplies to the purchaser of that business. Molecular Diagnostics product revenue (excluding blood screening) was $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $665.4 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues of $929.3 million from our two SARS-CoV-2 assays (primarily the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay and to a lesser extent the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay) and an increase in Panther and Panther Fusion instrument sales due to demand for increased testing capacity for COVID-19. We are actively working to increase capacity production to meet worldwide demand of these assays. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our Aptima women's health assays of $10.7 million on a worldwide basis in the current fiscal year primarily due to lower volumes, which we attribute primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a reduction in physician office visits and hospitals limiting services. In addition, we had an increase of $8.1 million in worldwide sales of our virology products in the current fiscal year. Cytology & Perinatal product revenue decreased $62.7 million in the current fiscal year primarily due to lower ThinPrep test volumes, which we attribute primarily to the reduction in wellness office visits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a lesser extent lower Perinatal product volumes. Testing volume in this category is also under pressure due to clinical guideline changes, which lengthen the interval between screenings and increasingly afford the option of HPV testing as the primary means of detection. Most recently, in July 2020, the American Cancer Society recommended using a primary human papillomavirus (HPV) test, rather than a Pap test, for cervical cancer screening. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our legacy product lines, we have experienced an increase in revenues sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to the fourth quarter indicating strength in a recovery of these end markets. We expect the market for our legacy diagnostics products to continue to be challenging in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and wellness visits continue to be delayed or cancelled. In the first two months of fiscal 2021, there has been an increase in the volume of reported positive COVID-19 cases.

Breast Health product revenues decreased 19.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in sales volume of our 3D and 2D digital mammography systems and related workflow products (primarily Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD and SmartCurve), Affirm Prone breast biopsy tables and our interventional breast solutions Eviva, ATEC and Celero handpieces. We primarily attribute the decline in revenues to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, in the U.S. as hospitals and imaging centers either slowed down purchases or delayed orders and installations of capital equipment units in order to focus their efforts towards COVID-19 patients and concerns on maintaining their cash and liquidity, as well as from the impact of delayed or cancelled elective imaging exams and procedures in response to the pandemic. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted these product lines, we have experienced an increase in revenues sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to the fourth quarter indicating strength in a recovery of these end markets. These decreases were partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from SSI which contributed $18.8 million of product revenue in fiscal 2020. We obtained control of SSI and began consolidating their results for the last fiscal month of the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect the market for our Breast Health products to continue to be challenging in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and beyond to

the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues and hospitals and healthcare centers continue to restrict access and wellness visits and elective medical procedures, and hospital and healthcare center capital expenditures continue to be delayed or cancelled. 

GYN Surgical product revenues decreased 14.1% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, which we primarily attribute to reduced sales volumes resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. MyoSure system sales decreased $21.5 million, and NovaSure system sales decreased $44.5 million. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted these product lines, we have experienced an increase in revenues sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to the fourth quarter indicating strength in a recovery of these end markets. Partially offsetting the decreases in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was an increase in Fluent system and disposable sales of $9.2 million. We expect the market for our GYN Surgical products to continue to be challenging in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and beyond to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues and hospitals and healthcare centers continue to restrict access and elective medical procedures continue to be delayed or cancelled. 

 Skeletal Health product revenues decreased 13.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 which we attribute primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a decrease in sales volume of our Horizon DXA systems and Insight FD mini C-arm system. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted these product lines, we have experienced an increase in revenues sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to the fourth quarter indicating strength in a recovery of these end markets. We expect a continued reduced demand for our Skeletal products in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and beyond to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues and hospitals and healthcare centers continue to restrict access, wellness and elective medical procedures continue to be delayed or cancelled and hospital and healthcare center capital expenditures continue to be delayed or cancelled.

We divested the Medical Aesthetics segment on December 30, 2019, the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2020. We have generated no revenue from the segment since that date.

Product revenues by geography as a percentage of total revenues were as follows:

The slight increase in the percentage of U.S. revenues in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, the majority of which were sold domestically. The increase in the percentage of product revenue derived from Europe was primarily due to sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays in fiscal 2020, and also included growth in Molecular Diagnostics as we expanded our customer base and increased sales from the adoption of co-testing for cervical cancer screening in Germany, as well as, the inclusion of SSI revenues, which are predominantly in Europe. Asia-Pacific product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales in China in fiscal 2020, which we primarily attribute to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting wellness visits and the disposition of Medical Aesthetics.

Service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. The majority of these revenues are generated within our Breast Health segment, and to a lesser extent, our Medical Aesthetics business prior to its disposition in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Service and other revenues decreased 7.8% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disposition of Medical Aesthetics, resulting in a decrease in revenue of $47.0 million in fiscal 2020. The Breast Health business continues to convert a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period, and Breast Health service contract revenue increased by $19.6 million in the current fiscal year. This increase

was partially offset by the decline in installation, spare parts and training revenue as hospitals and healthcare centers restricted access and capital expenditures continue to be delayed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current year, we generated additional royalty revenue from Grifols related to licensing intellectual property related to our COVID-19 assays for their sale in Spain. Additionally, we generated less service revenue in blood screening from Grifols in the current year and the prior year period included additional one-time license revenue in Breast Health.

Product gross margin was 61.8% in fiscal 2020 compared to 33.4% in fiscal 2019. Excluding the impairment of intangible assets and equipment included in cost of product revenues in both fiscal 2020 and 2019, product gross margin increased by 8.3% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.

Cost of Product Revenues.

 The cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 29.6% in the current year compared to 34.2% in the prior year. Cost of product revenues as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, which have higher gross margins compared to our other diagnostic products, and comprised 28.8% of total product revenue in fiscal 2020. Also benefiting gross margin was the disposition of Medical Aesthetics, which had lower gross margins compared to our remaining businesses. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in inventory reserves, higher freight costs and the step-up in fair value of inventory acquired in the SSI and Health Beacons acquisitions resulting in additional costs of $6.8 million.

Diagnostics' product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays and higher overall production reducing fixed overhead on a unit basis, partially offset by lower volumes of ThinPrep, an increase in inventory reserves, higher field service costs for the instrument installed base and an increase in freight charges internationally.

Breast Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to decreased sales volume across the majority of its product lines, period costs for temporary facility shut-downs and reduced manufacturing utilization, an increase in inventory reserves and the step-up in fair value of inventory acquired in the SSI and Health Beacons acquisitions resulting in additional costs of $6.8 million. We attribute these decreases primarily to the COVID-19 global pandemic as hospitals and imaging centers either slowed down purchases or delayed orders and installations of capital equipment units in order to focus their efforts towards COVID-19 patients and concerns on maintaining their cash and liquidity, as well as from the impact of delayed or cancelled elective imaging exams, screenings and procedures as described above. 

GYN Surgical’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the significant decrease in sales volume of our NovaSure and MyoSure devices, period costs for the temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facility and reduced manufacturing utilization, higher Fluent disposable sales at lower margins, as well as the continued product mix shift to a higher percentage of sales of MyoSure devices, which have lower margins than NovaSure devices. 

Skeletal Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to lower sales volume and an increase in inventory reserves. 

We divested the Medical Aesthetics segment on December 30, 2019, the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2020.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

 Amortization of intangible assets included in cost of product revenues relates to acquired developed technology, which is generally amortized over its estimated useful life of between 5 and 15 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. Amortization expense decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower amortization of $63.5 million from intangible assets acquired in the Cynosure acquisition as a result of impairment charges (partially offset by shortening lives of certain assets) in fiscal 2019, the classification of the Medical Aesthetics business as assets held-for-sale in November 2019 and its subsequent disposition on December 30, 2019, and lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Cytyc acquisition which reduce over time. These decreases were partially offset by amortization expense in the current fiscal year related to intangible assets primarily acquired in the SSI acquisition of $3.6 million.

Impairment of Intangible Assets and Equipment.

 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $30.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The impairment charge was allocated to the Medical Aesthetics long-lived assets, of which $25.8 million was allocated to developed technology assets and written off to cost of revenues. During fiscal 2019, 

we identified indicators of impairment for our Medical Aesthetics reporting unit as a result of reductions in forecasts during the year, and in connection with our efforts to sell the business that began prior to the end of fiscal 2019. As a result of these indicators of impairment, we recorded total impairment charges of $685.4 million in fiscal 2019, which was allocated to developed technology for $576.9 million and equipment assets for $1.8 million, which is included in cost of revenues.

Service and other revenues gross margin was 42.4% in fiscal 2020 compared to 41.2% in fiscal 2019. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the disposition of Medical Aesthetics as service margins for Medical Aesthetics were lower compared to the Breast Health business, which generated the majority of our service revenues. In addition, in the current year, the Breast Health business had lower warranty and repair costs, including personnel costs, as hospitals and healthcare centers restricted access. The decrease in revenue from installation, spare parts and training also benefited gross margin as these services have lower margins compared to service contract revenue. In addition, the Diagnostics business had higher royalty revenue in fiscal 2020, which has higher margins. Partially offsetting these increases was lower license revenue in Breast Health in the current year, as the prior year period included additional one-time license revenue.

Research and Development Expenses.

 Research and development expenses decreased 4.2% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disposition of the Medical Aesthetics business in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, we had a $19.8 million decrease in research and development expenses for that segment in fiscal 2020. Partially offsetting this decrease was higher compensation and benefits driven by higher bonus and expense from our deferred

Table of Contents

compensation plan as the expense is primarily driven by the mark-to-market of the value of the underlying investments, the addition of SSI expenses, increased spending to implement the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) requirements, and higher software development costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in R&D consulting and project spend across the divisions as cuts or deferred spending actions were implemented in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resources in Diagnostics were focused on the development and approval of our SARS-CoV-2 assays. In addition, during the current fiscal year, we recorded a reduction to research and development expenses of $7.1 million attributable to our grant from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to expand manufacturing capacity, obtain FDA approval of our SARS-CoV-2 assays and develop sampling pooling capability and other enhancements to our SARS-CoV-2 assays. The prior fiscal year included a $4.5 million charge related to the purchase of intellectual property in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. At any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.

Selling and Marketing Expenses.

 Selling and marketing expenses decreased 14.2% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disposition of the Medical Aesthetics business. As a result, we had a $86.9 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses for that segment in fiscal 2020. In addition, in fiscal 2020, there were decreases in travel, commissions, third party commissions, trade shows and consulting, partially offset by an increase in marketing initiatives spending primarily for the Diagnostics segment and to a lesser extent corporate initiatives, an increase in bonus expense and the inclusion of SSI expenses in the current fiscal year of $15.3 million. 

General and Administrative Expenses.

 General and administrative expenses increased 7.1% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits driven by higher bonus, stock compensation and expense from our deferred compensation plan, charitable donations of $15.0 million, an increase in bad debt expense, higher facilities and infrastructure costs, and the addition of $6.9 million of SSI expenses. Partially offsetting these increases were lower expenses of $10.6 million in fiscal 2020 from the disposition of the Medical Aesthetics business, credits related to services provided under the transition services agreement with Cynosure, lower travel, and lower legal expenses as the prior year period included higher litigation and settlement costs related to the Fuji, Enzo and Minerva lawsuits. In addition, in fiscal 2020 expenses were higher due to project expenses related to the Medical Aesthetics disposition including accelerated stock compensation, partially offset by acquisition-related hold-back and accrual reversals.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

 Amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, distributor relationships and business licenses related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization expense decreased 23.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower amortization from intangible assets acquired in the Cynosure acquisition as a result of impairment charges (partially offset by shortening lives of certain assets) in fiscal 2019 and the classification of the Medical Aesthetics business as assets held-for-sale in November 2019 and its subsequent disposition on December 30, 2019.

Impairment of Intangible Assets and Equipment. 

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $30.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The impairment charge was allocated to the Medical Aesthetics long-lived assets of which $4.4 million was written off to operating expenses. As discussed above, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $685.4 million during fiscal 2019. The impairment charges were allocated to the long-lived assets and written off to operating expenses in the amounts of $22.4 million to customer relationships, $48.6 million to trade names, $27.7 million to distribution agreements and $8.0 million to equipment.

Restructuring Charges.

 We have implemented various cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with our operations and related to integration activities. In addition, we have recorded divestiture charges. These actions have primarily resulted in the termination of employees. As a result, we recorded charges of $15.3 million in fiscal 2020 and $6.6 million in fiscal 2019, primarily related to severance benefits. For additional information, please refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

Interest expense in fiscal 2020 and 2019 consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt. Interest expense in fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in LIBOR year over year, the basis for determining interest expense under our 2018 Credit Agreement and lower interest expense from the Securitization Program which was paid-off in full in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by interest expense on net borrowings on our revolver and lower proceeds received under our interest rate cap agreements that hedge the variable interest rate under our credit facilities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was a benefit of 10.8%. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a $313.4 million discrete net tax benefit related to the sale of the Medical Aesthetics business, the impact of the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangible income, federal and state tax credits, and the geographic mix of income earned by our international subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, partially offset by state income taxes, reserves for uncertain tax positions net of releases resulting from statute of limitations expirations and favorable audit settlements, the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion, and unbenefited foreign losses. 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 21.0%. The effective tax rate, applied to an overall pre-tax loss resulting in a benefit, was equal to the statutory tax rate primarily due to the offsetting impacts of a discrete benefit related to an internal restructuring, earnings in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates, reserves for uncertain tax positions and releases resulting from statute of limitations expirations and favorable audit settlements, a valuation allowance resulting from the Medical Aesthetics impairment charge, and finalizing the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 

As of December 29, 2018, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act, recording a benefit reduction of $5.0 million in the three months ended December 29, 2018. We recognized a final net benefit amount of $341.2 million related to the Act, which was included as a component of income tax expense.

Segment Results of Operations

Until the divestiture of our Medical Aesthetics segment, we reported our business in five segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, Medical Aesthetics, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. We completed the disposition of the Medical Aesthetics segment on December 30, 2019 (the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2020). The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report. We measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income. Revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.

Diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the increase in product revenues associated with the commercial launch of our SARS-CoV-2 assays discussed above. 

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin was 65.2% in the current year compared to 47.3% in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, higher overall production reducing fixed overhead on a unit basis and royalty revenue from Grifols, partially offset by lower volumes of ThinPrep, an increase in inventory reserves, higher field service costs for the instrument installed base and an increase in freight charges internationally. 

Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increase in research and development expenses from higher compensation and benefits driven by higher bonus expense, increased project spend and software development costs partially offset by the BARDA $7.1 million credit, higher compensation across other functions due to focus on the development and approval of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, an increase in marketing initiatives, an increase in bad debt expense and an allocated portion of charitable donations. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in travel, consulting and trade shows. The increase in the current year period was also partially offset as a result of the prior year period including a $10.5 million settlement charge related to the Enzo litigation.

Breast Health revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $164.7 million in product revenue as discussed above, partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in service and other revenue. The increase in service revenue is primarily due to continued conversion of a high percentage of the installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period, partially offset by lower installation, spare parts and training revenue as hospitals and healthcare centers continue to restrict access and capital expenditures continue to be delayed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the prior year period including additional one-time license revenue.

Operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from lower revenues with lower gross margin and an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin was 52.8% in the current fiscal year, compared to 57.8% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased sales volume of our products, period costs related to temporary facility shut-downs and reduced manufacturing utilization, an increase in inventory reserves, the step-up in fair value of inventory acquired in the SSI and Health Beacons acquisitions resulting in additional costs of $6.8 million and higher intangible asset amortization expense.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses, trade shows, R&D project spend, commissions and third party commissions. The increase is also driven as a result of the prior year period included a benefit from settling the Fuji litigation, partially offset by the reversal of acquisition related accruals and a hold-back in fiscal 2020.

Medical Aesthetics revenue and operating loss decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the divestiture of the Medical Aesthetics segment on December 30, 2019, the first day of our second quarter of fiscal 2020. We will continue to incur expenses related to legal and tax matters that we have agreed to retain. The operating loss in the current fiscal year and the corresponding period in the prior year included intangible assets and equipment impairment charges of $30.2 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and $443.8 million and $241.6 million recorded in the second and fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, respectively.

Fiscal Year Ended September 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 29, 2018

Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At September 26, 2020, we had working capital of $983.0 million, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $701.0 million. Our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $99.2 million during fiscal 2020 principally due to cash generated from operating activities partially offset by cash used in financing and investing activities related to net repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock and capital expenditures.

As we assessed the potential longer term economic and capital market uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 we suspended our accounts receivable securitization program and borrowed $750.0 million under our revolver. We used $250.0 million of these proceeds to pay off all amounts then owed under our accounts receivable securitization agreement, and retained the balance as cash reserves. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, we repaid a total of $500.0 million on amounts borrowed under our revolver. As of September 26, 2020, we had $1.25 billion available under our revolver.

In fiscal 2020, our operating activities provided us with $896.6 million of cash, primarily due to net income of $1,110.5 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization aggregating $376.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $83.3 million, and non-cash intangible asset and equipment impairment charges aggregating $30.2 million. These adjustments to net income were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of $94.4 million primarily due to the amortization 

46

Table of Contents

of intangible assets and the intangible assets impairment charge. Cash provided by operations included a net cash outflow of $636.3 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by an increase in accounts receivable of $427.1 million primarily due to increased sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $286.2 million, primarily due to recording a $313.4 million tax refund receivable in connection with carrying back the Medical Aesthetics' loss, and an increase in inventory of $25.3 million primarily due to lower Breast Health sales than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased raw materials and inventory to support SARS-CoV-2 assay demand. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was an increase in accrued expenses of $96.0 million primarily due to an increase in accrued bonus, federal income taxes and other taxes, and an increase in deferred revenue of $15.0 million primarily due to an increase in service contracts as the Breast Health business continues to convert a high percentage of its installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period.

In fiscal 2020, our investing activities used cash of $141.6 million primarily related to acquisition payments of $119.4 million primarily for the Acessa Health, Alpha Imaging and Health Beacons acquisitions and $156.4 million for capital expenditures, which consisted of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchases of manufacturing equipment primarily to expand the capacity of our molecular diagnostics manufacturing facilities. These uses of cash were primarily offset by net proceeds received from the sale of the Medical Aesthetics business of $139.3 million.

In fiscal 2020, our financing activities used cash of $659.9 million, primarily for payments of $653.6 million for repurchases of our common stock on the open market, $234.0 million for the net repayment of amounts borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization agreement, $37.5 million for scheduled principal payments under our 2018 Credit Agreement, payment of $24.3 million for hold-back and contingent consideration payments related to the Focal, Faxitron and Emsor acquisitions, and payments of $14.3 million for employee-related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were $250.0 million of net proceeds on amounts borrowed under our revolving credit line and $65.6 million from our equity plans, primarily the exercise of stock options.

Debt

We had total recorded debt outstanding of $3.0 billion at September 26, 2020, which was comprised of our term loan under our 2018 Credit Agreement of $1.45 billion (principal of $1.46 billion), our revolver under our 2018 Credit Agreement of $250.0 million (principal of $250.0 million), 2025 Senior Notes of $939.4 million (principal of $950.0 million), and 2028 Senior Notes of $394.6 million (principal of $400.0 million)

2018 Credit Agreement

On December 17, 2018, we refinanced our term loan and revolving credit facility by entering into an Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2018 (the "2018 Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. in its capacity as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and certain other lenders. The 2018 Credit Agreement amended and restated our prior credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of October 3, 2017 ("2017 Credit Agreement"). 

The credit facilities under the 2018 Credit Agreement consist of:

•

A $1.5 billion secured term loan ("2018 Term Loan") with a maturity date of December 17, 2023; and 

•

A secured revolving credit facility ("2018 Revolver"; together with the 2018 Term Loan, the "Amended Credit Facilities") under which the Company may borrow up to $1.5 billion, subject to certain sublimits, with a maturity date of December 17, 2023.

The borrowings on the 2018 Term Loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate (i.e., the LIBOR rate) plus an Applicable Rate, which was equal to 1.25% as of September 26, 2020. The borrowings of the 2018 Amended Revolver bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus an Applicable Rate equal to 1.25% as of September 26, 2020. At September 26, 2020, borrowings under the 2018 Term Loan were subject to an interest rate of 1.40%.

Borrowings made under the 2018 Credit Agreement, bear interest, at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based upon our total net leverage ratio as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement.

We are required to make scheduled principal payments under the 2018 Term Loan in increasing amounts ranging from $9.375 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on December 27, 2019 to $28.125 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on December 29, 2022 and ending on September 29, 2023. The remaining balance of the 2018 Term Loan after the scheduled principal payments, which is $1.2

billion as of September 26, 2020, and any amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolver are due at maturity. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2018 Credit Agreement, we may be required to make certain mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales (subject to certain reinvestment rights), debt issuances and insurance recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment rights). These mandatory prepayments are required to be applied by us, first, to the 2018 Term Loan, second, to any outstanding amount under any Swing Line Loans, third, to the 2018 Revolver, fourth to prepay any outstanding reimbursement obligations with respect to Letters of Credit and fifth, to cash collateralize any Letters of Credit. Subject to certain limitations, the Company may voluntarily prepay any of the 2018 Credit Facilities without premium or penalty.

Borrowings are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. For example, borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement are not secured by those accounts receivable that are transferred to the special purpose entity under our Accounts Receivable Securitization program. 

The 2018 Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants restricting our ability, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and grant additional liens on its assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of their businesses. In addition, the 2018 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. The 2018 Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross defaults and an event of default upon a change of control of the company.

The 2018 Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants (a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio) measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of September 26, 2020, we were in compliance with these covenants.

2025 Senior Notes

As of September 26, 2020, we had 2025 Senior Notes outstanding in the total aggregate principal of $950.0 million. On September 28, 2020 (in the first quarter of fiscal 2021), we completed a private placement of $950 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.250% Senior Notes due 2029 (the "2029 Senior Notes") at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes. The proceeds from this offering and cash on hand were used to redeem the 2025 Senior Notes in full on October 15, 2020, a redemption price of approximately $970.8 million (equal to 102.2% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes). See "Subsequent Event - 2029 Senior Notes" for further discussion.

2028 Senior Notes

As of September 26, 2020, the total aggregate principal balance of the 2028 Senior Notes was $400.0 million. The 2028 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries. The 2028 Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of January 19, 2018, among the Company, the guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The 2028 Senior Notes mature on February 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.625% per year, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2018. We may redeem the 2028 Senior Notes at any time prior to February 1, 2023 at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture. We may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before February 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. We also have the option to redeem the 2028 Senior Notes on or after: February 1, 2023 through February 1, 2024 at 102.312% of par; February 1, 2024 through February 1, 2025 at 101.541% of par; February 1, 2025 through February 1, 2026 at 100.770% of par; and February 1, 2026 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2028 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Program

On April 25, 2016, we entered into a one-year $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization program (the "Securitization Program") with several of our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial institutions, which provides for annual renewals.

48

Table of Contents

Under the terms of the Securitization Program, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries sell our customer receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is wholly-owned by us. The special purpose entity, as borrower, and we, as servicer, have entered into a Credit and Security Agreement with several lenders pursuant to which the special purpose entity may borrow from the lenders up to the maximum borrowing amount allowed, with the loans secured by the receivables. The amount that the special purpose entity may borrow at a given point in time is determined based on the amount of qualifying receivables that are present in the special purpose entity at such point in time. The assets of the special purpose entity secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities.

 Effective April 18, 2019, we entered into an amendment to extend the Securitization Program an additional year to April 17, 2020. Under the amendment, the maximum borrowing amount increased from $225.0 million to $250.0 million. In response to the market uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 26, 2020, we paid-off the total amount outstanding of $250.0 million previously borrowed under the Securitization Program. On April 13, 2020, we amended the Credit and Security agreement with the lenders, temporarily suspending the ability to borrow and the need to comply with covenants for up to a year. As of September 26, 2020, we did not have any borrowings under this program.

Borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program bear interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin of 0.7% and are included as a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, while the accounts receivable securing these obligations remain as a component of net receivables in our consolidated balance sheet. We and the special purpose entity are operated and maintained as separate legal entities. The assets of the special purpose entity secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities.

The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, and an event of default upon a change of control. In addition, it contains financial covenants consistent with that of the Credit Agreement. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had amended the Credit and Security Agreement, temporarily suspending the need to comply with the financial covenants for up to one year.

2029 Senior Notes

On September 28, 2020, we completed a private placement of our 2029 Senior Notes. The total aggregate principal balance of the 2029 Senior Notes is $950.0 million. The 2029 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries. The 2029 Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of September 28, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2029 and bear interest at the rate of 3.250% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021. We may redeem the 2029 Senior Notes at any time prior to September 28, 2023 at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture. We may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before September 28, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 103.250% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. We also have the option to redeem the 2029 Senior Notes on or after: September 28, 2023 through September 27, 2024 at 101.625% of par; September 28, 2024 through September 27, 2025 at 100.813% of par; and September 28, 2025 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2029 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

Contingent Consideration Earn-Out Payments

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earn-out payments tied to performance criteria, principally revenue growth of the acquired business over a specified period. In addition, contractual provisions relating to these contingent earn-out obligations may result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the acquired business. Such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources. Our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses.

Our contingent consideration arrangements are recorded as either additional purchase price or compensation expense if continuing employment is required to receive such payments. Pursuant to ASC 805, contingent consideration that is deemed to be part of the purchase price is recorded as a liability based on the estimated fair value of the consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business as of the acquisition date. This liability is re-measured each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded through a separate line item within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes in discount rates, changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates, and accretion of the liability for the passage of time. 

Our primary contingent consideration liability is from our acquisition of Acessa Health. We have an obligation to the former Acessa Health shareholders to make contingent payments based on a multiple of annual incremental revenue growth over a three-year period ending annually in December. There is no maximum earnout. Pursuant to ASC 805, the contingent consideration was deemed to be part of the purchase price and we recorded our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation based on future revenue projections of the business, comparable companies revenue growth rates, implied volatility and applying a risk adjusted discount rate. At September 26, 2020 this liability was recorded at $81.8 million and no contingent payments have earned or been made.

Stock Repurchase Program

On December 11, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock, effective at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. On March 2, 2020, the Board of Directors approved accelerating the effective date of the new share repurchase plan from March 27, 2020 to March 2, 2020. As of September 26, 2020, $262.4 million remained available under this authorization. Subsequent to September 26, 2020, we have repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for $74.8 million.

Pension obligations do not include our obligation under our deferred compensation plans of $57.7 million at September 26, 2020, which is recorded as a current liability. Deferred compensation plan benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment.

The above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with reserves for uncertain tax positions recorded under ASC 740, 

Income Taxes

 totaling $103.7 million. Due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties, we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non-current liabilities. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits. 

Future Liquidity Considerations

We expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions (both acquisitions and dispositions) and alliances that we believe will complement or enhance our business and stockholder value. Subject to the Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and the general disclaimers set forth in our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this Annual Report, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, the cash available under our 2018 Revolver and our Securitization Program will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations and debt payments over the next twelve months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions including contingent consideration payments, strategic transactions or other investments. As described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our 2018 Credit Agreement, 2028 Senior Notes, and 2029 Senior Notes. These capital requirements could be substantial. Our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above-referenced Risk Factors set forth elsewhere in this report. These risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.

Legal Contingencies

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. In connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. These estimates are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. In accordance with ASC 450, 

Contingencies

, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.

Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Inventory

Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. As a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment and diagnostic test kits, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. Our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. Although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results.

Business Combinations

We record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. Contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition using an appropriate valuation model, such as the Monte Carlo simulation model. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, in which the model runs many simulations based on comparable companies' growth rates and their implied volatility. These cash flow projections are discounted with a risk adjusted rate. Each quarter until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and given the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded and could be materially different.

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimate of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. 

We generally use the income approach in which cash flow projections on an after-tax basis are discounted using a risk adjusted rate to determine the estimated fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development projects, customer relationships, and trade names.

With respect to property, plant and equipment, we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the component. Generally, we apply the cost or income approach as the primary methods in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties.

Goodwill

We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Events that 

52

Table of Contents

could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.

In performing the test, we either use the qualitative assessment permitted by ASC 350 or the single step quantitative approach prescribed under ASC 350 including amendments under ASU 2017-04. Under the qualitative approach we consider a number of factors, including the amount by which the previous quantitative test's fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units, the forecasts in our then-current 5 year strategic plan compared to the forecasts in the previous quantitative test, an evaluation of discount rates, long-term growth rates including the terminal year rate, if tax rates would have significantly changed, an evaluation of current economic factors for both the worldwide economy and specifically the medical device industry, and any significant changes in customer and supplier relationships. We weigh these factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If after performing a qualitative assessment, indicators are present, or we identify factors that cause us to believe it is appropriate to perform a more precise calculation of fair value, we would move beyond the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.

Under the quantitative impairment test, we perform a comparison of the reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. The valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and

 ratio comparisons of similar companies. We base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, of market participants. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we apply the single step approach under ASU 2017-04. As a result of this simplified approach the goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value to the extent of the goodwill balance.

We conducted our fiscal 2020 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter and utilized the quantitative approach. We utilized discounted cash flows, or DCF, and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of June 28, 2020 and ultimately used the fair value determined by the DCF in making our impairment test conclusions. We believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. As a result of completing this analysis, all of our reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values. For illustrative purposes, had the fair value of each of our reporting units been lower by 10%, all of our reporting units would still have passed the goodwill impairment test.

At September 26, 2020, we believe that our reporting units, with goodwill aggregating $2.6 billion, were not at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test based on its current forecasts and qualitative assessment.

Since the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the DCF, and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the WACC, terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, significant judgment is applied in determining fair value. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, this would likely result in a higher WACC because market participants would require a higher rate of return. In the DCF as the WACC increases, the fair value decreases. The other significant factor in the DCF is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and stated net of accumulated amortization and impairments. We amortize intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method, or if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be utilized. We evaluate the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances or business conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on expectations of future undiscounted cash flows for each asset group. If the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, the Company estimates the fair value of the assets, generally utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the assets using a risk-adjusted discount rate. To estimate the fair value of the assets, the Company uses market participant assumptions pursuant to ASC 820.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of our products, primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems. See Note 3 for further discussion of revenue recognition.

53

Table of Contents

We consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met: we have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; promised products or services are identified; the transaction price, or the amount that we expect to receive, including an estimate of uncertain amounts subject to a constraint to ensure revenue is not recognized in an amount that would result in a significant reversal upon resolution of the uncertainty, is determinable; and we have transferred control of the promised items to the customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in the contract. The transaction price for the contract is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services expected to be transferred. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, control of the distinct good or service is transferred. Transfer of control for our products is generally at shipment or delivery, depending on contractual terms, but occurs when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer which represents the point in time when the customer obtains the use of and substantially all of the remaining benefit of the product. As such, the performance obligation related to product sales is satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from support and maintenance contracts and extended warranties are recognized over time based on the contract term, which represents a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services given the stand-ready nature of the performance obligations. Service revenue related to professional services for installation, training and repairs is recognized as the services are performed based on the specific nature of the service.

We recognize receivables when we have an unconditional right to payment, which represents the amount we expect to collect in a transaction and is most often equal to the transaction price in the contract. Payment terms are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record these costs within costs of product revenue when the corresponding revenue is recognized.

Some of our contracts have multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we are required to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. We determine the best estimate of standalone selling price using average selling prices over 3- to 12-month periods of data depending on the products or nature of the services coupled with current market considerations. If the product or service does not have a history of sales or if sales volume is not sufficient, we rely on prices set by our pricing committees or applicable marketing department adjusted for expected discounts. 

We also place instruments (or equipment) at customer sites but retain title to the instrument (for example, the ThinPrep Processor, ThinPrep Imaging System, and the Panther system). The customer has the right to use the instrument for a period of time, and then we recover the cost of providing the instrument through the sales of disposables, namely tests and assays in Diagnostics and handpieces in GYN Surgical. These types of agreements include an embedded operating lease for the right to use an instrument and no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument delivery. We recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the embedded lease concurrent with the sale of disposables over the term of the agreement.

Income Taxes

We use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, 

Income Taxes

. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and also for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards at each reporting period. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws applicable to the period and jurisdiction in which we expect the differences to affect taxable income. We evaluate both the positive and negative evidence that affects the realizability of net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance. The future benefit to be derived from our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in each jurisdiction of the right type to realize the assets. We establish a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. To the extent we establish or release a valuation allowance, a tax charge or benefit will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision on the statement of operations in the reporting period that such determination is made.

We have recognized $186.3 million in net deferred tax liabilities at September 26, 2020 and $258.1 million at September 28, 2019. The reduction was primarily due to intangible asset amortization recorded in fiscal 2020. The liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, accruals and reserves, stock-based compensation, and research credits. 

Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to,

changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

As of September 26, 2020, we had $197.1 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $184.9 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2019, we had $101.6 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $87.3 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. The Company accounts for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period cost.

In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. While we consider our estimates reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.
