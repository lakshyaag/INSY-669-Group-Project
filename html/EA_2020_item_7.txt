Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

The following overview is a high-level discussion of our operating results, as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business. Management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including in the “Business” section and the “Risk Factors” above, the remainder of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”)” or the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.

About Electronic Arts

Electronic Arts is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. We develop, market, publish and deliver games, content and services that can be played and watched on game consoles, PCs, mobile phones and tablets. We believe that the breadth and depth of our portfolio, live services offerings, and our use of multiple business models and distribution channels provide us with strategic advantages. Our foundation is a collection of intellectual property from which we create innovative games and content that enables us to build on-going and meaningful relationships with a community of players, creators and viewers. Our portfolio includes brands that we either wholly own (such as Battlefield, The Sims, Apex Legends, Need for Speed and Plants v. Zombies) or license from others (such as FIFA, Madden NFL and Star Wars). We also offer our players high-quality experiences designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay. Our live services experiences include extra content, subscription offerings and other revenue generated outside of the sale of our base games. In addition, we are focused on reaching more players whenever and wherever they want to play. We believe that we can add value to our network by making it easier for players to connect to a world of play by offering choice of business model, distribution channel and device.

Financial Results

Our key financial results for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were as follows:

•

Total net revenue was $5,537 million, up 12 percent year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate 

total net revenue would have been $5,610 million, up 13 percent year-over-year.

•

Digital net revenue was $4,314 million, up 16 percent year-over-year.

•

Gross margin was 75.3 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year. 

•

Operating expenses were $2,723 million, up 3 percent year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that operating expenses would have been $2,754 million, up 5 percent year-over-year.

•

Operating income was $1,445 million, up 45 percent year-over-year.

•

Net income was $3,039 million, including a one-time net tax benefit of $1,760 million. Excluding the one-time tax benefit, net income would have been $1,279 million, up 26 percent year-over-year.

•

Diluted earnings per share was $10.30, including a one-time net tax benefit of $5.97. Excluding the one-time tax benefit, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.33, up 30 percent year-over-year.

•

Operating cash flow was $1,797 million, up 16 percent year-over-year.

•

Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5,735 million.

•

We repurchased 12.3 million shares of our common stock for $1,207 million.

From time to time, we make comparisons of current periods to prior periods with reference to constant currency. Constant currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the current period at actual foreign exchange rates from the prior comparable period. We evaluate our financial performance on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates. For additional information on the one-time net tax benefit excluded above from net income and diluted earnings per share, please see Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in

Trends in Our Business

COVID-19 Impact

. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our people and our business. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have focused on actions to support our people, our players, and communities around the world that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table of Contents

Our People

: First, we have focused on the health and wellbeing of our people and their families. During the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work from home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Our IT, security and digital platform teams mobilized to add capacity to our remote working systems to scale to a distributed workforce and support business continuity. To date, substantially all of our people outside of Shanghai are continuing to work from home. We have developed a detailed protocol for how we will evaluate the readiness to return to work for each of our offices around the world, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees, and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing.

Our Business

: Throughout this time, we have also focused on what we can do for our players. We launched our “Stay Home, Play Together” initiative to bring our players together when physical distancing is keeping us apart, and dozens of Stay & Play programs have been delivered to date. With more people staying at home we have experienced, and are continuing to experience, heightened levels of engagement and live services net bookings growth during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and during the current fiscal quarter to date.

Future Outlook

: The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to predict. For example, we do not know when stay-at-home orders will be eased and lifted, and how our products and services will be impacted when that occurs. Engagement and net bookings could subside. Additional factors that could impact our business – particularly if stay-at-home orders remain in place for the longer term or a second wave of stay-at-home orders is necessary – include: our ability to deliver new games and services in a distributed work environment, macroeconomic challenges that impact consumer demand, the status of sports seasons on which our products and live services are based, impacts to our key business partners, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and other factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors”.

Live Services Business. 

We offer our players high-quality experiences designed to provide value to players and to extend and enhance gameplay. These live services include extra content, subscription offerings and other revenue generated outside of the sale of our base games. 

Our net revenue attributable to digital live services for console and PC was 

$2,813 million, $2,216 million and $2,083 million during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business. Net revenue attributable to extra content, which includes extra content within digital live services for console and PC as well as extra content within our mobile business was $2,763 million, $2,309 million and $2,033 million during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Extra content net revenue has increased as players engage with our games and services over longer periods of time, and purchase additional content designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay. Our most popular live service is the extra content purchased for the Ultimate Team mode associated with our sports franchises. Ultimate Team allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team. Net revenue from extra content sales for Ultimate Team was $1,491 million, $1,369 million and $1,180 million during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a substantial portion of which was derived from FIFA Ultimate Team.

Digital Delivery of Games. 

In our industry, players increasingly purchase games digitally as opposed to purchasing physical discs. While this trend, as applied to our business, may not be linear because of product mix during a fiscal year, consumer buying patterns and other factors, over time we expect players to purchase an increasingly higher proportion of our games digitally; therefore we expect net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads to increase over time and net revenue attributable to sales of packaged goods to decrease. Our net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads was $809 million, $680 million and $707 million during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively; while our net revenue attributable to packaged goods sales decreased from $1,700 million in fiscal year 2018 to $1,240 million in fiscal year 2019 and $1,223 million in fiscal year 2020. In addition, as measured based on total units sold on Microsoft’s Xbox One and Sony’s PlayStation 4 rather than by net revenue, we estimate that 49 percent, 49 percent, and 39 percent of our total units sold during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were sold digitally. Digital full game units are based on sales information provided by Microsoft and Sony; packaged goods units sold through are estimated by obtaining data from significant retail partners in North America, Europe and Asia, and applying internal sales estimates with respect to retail partners from which we do not obtain data. We believe that these percentages are reasonable estimates of the proportion of our games that are digitally downloaded in relation to our total number of units sold for the applicable period of measurement. We expect the long-term trends in revenue and in the percentage of games digitally downloaded to continue. Increases in consumer adoption of digital purchase of games combined with increases in our live services revenue generally results in expansion of our gross margin, as costs associated with selling a game digitally is generally less than selling the same game through traditional retail and distribution channels.

Free-to-Play Games.

 The global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no up-front cost, and that are monetized through a live service associated with the game, particularly extra content sales, has led to significant sales growth in the mobile gaming industry. Similarly, sales of extra content are the primary driver of our mobile business. We expect the mobile gaming industry to continue to grow during our 2021 fiscal year. Likewise, 

26

Table of Contents

the consumer acceptance of free-to-play, live service-based, online PC games has broadened our consumer base and has begun to expand into the console market. For example, within our business, we offer Apex Legends as a free-to-play, live service-based PC and console game. We expect extra content revenue generated from mobile, PC and console free-to-play games to remain an important part of our business.

Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Games

. In all major segments of our industry, we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises, several of which we have released on an annual or bi-annual basis. In particular, we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our largest and most popular game, FIFA, the annualized version of which is consistently one of the best-selling games in the marketplace.

Recurring Revenue Sources. 

Our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature, such as revenue from our annualized sports franchises (e.g., FIFA, Madden NFL), our console, PC and mobile catalog titles (i.e., titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year), and our live services. We have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games, services and business models. As we continue to incorporate new business models and modalities of play into our games, our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business.

Net Bookings

. In order to improve transparency into our business, we disclose an operating performance metric, net bookings. Net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period. Net bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for online-enabled games and platform fees.

The following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented:

Digital net bookings were $4,052 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $330 million or 9 percent as compared to fiscal year 2019. The increase in digital net bookings was primarily driven by our live services which grew $372 million or 15 percent year-over-year, primarily due to sales of extra content for 

Apex Legends, FIFA Ultimate Team

 and

 Madden Ultimate Team;

 and full game downloads which grew $18 million or 2 percent due to

 

net bookings associated with 

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order 

and

 Need for Speed Heat, 

partially offset by

 Battlefield V

. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $60 million or 10 percent in our mobile business due to declines from aging titles.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates with respect to revenue recognition for revenue transactions occurring prior to April 1, 2018, which were accounted for under ASC 605, 

Revenue Recognition

 (the “Old Revenue Standard” or “ASC 605”), refer to Part II, Item 7 “

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations

” under the subheading 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 23, 2018. With respect to revenue transactions occurring on April 1, 2018 and onward, our revenue recognition accounting policy is set forth below and follows ASC 606, 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

 (the “New Revenue Standard” or “ASC 606”)

.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue principally from sales of our games, and related extra content and services that can be played on game consoles, PCs, mobile phones and tablets. Our product and service offerings include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

full games with both online and offline functionality (“Games with Services”), which generally includes (1) the initial game delivered digitally or via physical disc at the time of sale and typically provide access to offline core game content (“software license”); (2) updates on a when-and-if-available basis, such as software patches or updates, and/or additional free content to be delivered in the future (“future update rights”); and (3) a hosted connection for online playability (“online hosting”);

•

full games with online-only functionality which require an Internet connection to access all gameplay and functionality (“Online-Hosted Service Games”);

•

extra content related to Games with Services and Online-Hosted Service Games which provides access to additional in-game content;

•

subscriptions, such as Origin Access, Origin Access Premier and EA Access, that generally offers access to a selection of full games, in-game content, online services and other benefits typically for a recurring monthly or annual fee; and

•

licensing to third parties to distribute and host our games and content.

We evaluate and recognize revenue by:

•

identifying the contract(s) with the customer; 

•

identifying the performance obligations in the contract;

•

determining the transaction price;

•

allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and

•

recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer (i.e., “transfer of control”).

Certain of our full game and/or extra content are sold to resellers with a contingency that the full game and/or extra content cannot be resold prior to a specific date (“Street Date Contingency”). We recognize revenue for transactions that have a Street Date Contingency when the Street Date Contingency is removed and the full game and/or extra content can be resold by the reseller. For digital full game and/or extra content downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when the full game and/or extra content is made available for download to the customer.

Online-Enabled Games

Games with Services. 

Our sales of Games with Services are evaluated to determine whether the software license, future update rights and the online hosting are distinct and separable. Sales of Games with Services are generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations: software license, future update rights, and the online hosting.

Since we do not sell the performance obligations on a stand-alone basis, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation. For Games with Services, generally 75 percent of the sales price is allocated to the software license performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control of the license has been transferred to the customer (which is usually at or near the same time as the booking of the transaction). The remaining 25 percent is allocated to the future update rights and the online hosting performance obligations and recognized ratably as the service is provided (over the Estimated Offering Period).

28

Table of Contents

Online-Hosted Service Games. 

Sales of our Online-Hosted Service Games are determined to have one distinct performance obligation: the online hosting. We recognize revenue from these arrangements as the service is provided.

Extra Content.

 

Revenue received from sales of downloadable content are derived primarily from the sale of virtual currencies and digital in-game content that enhance players’ game experience. Sales of extra content are accounted for in a manner consistent with the treatment for our Games with Services and Online-Hosted Service Games as discussed above, depending upon whether or not the extra content has offline functionality. That is, if the extra content has offline functionality, then the extra content is accounted for similarly to Games with Services (generally determined to have three distinct performance obligations: software license, future update rights, and the online hosting). If the extra content does not have offline functionality, then the extra content is determined to have one distinct performance obligation: the online-hosted service offering.

Subscriptions

Sales of our subscriptions are deemed to be one performance obligation and we recognize revenue from these arrangements  ratably over the subscription term as the performance obligation is satisfied.

Licensing Revenue

In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games and content in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and/or sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations, such as a time-based license of software and future update rights. We recognize as revenue a portion of the minimum guarantee when we transfer control of the license of software (generally upon commercial launch) and the remaining portion ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the licensee with future update rights. Any sales-based royalties are generally recognized as the related sales occur by the licensee.

Significant Judgments around Revenue Arrangements

Identifying performance obligations.

 Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, (i.e., the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available), and are distinct in the context of the contract (i.e., it is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract). To the extent a contract includes multiple promises, we must apply judgment to determine whether those promises are separate and distinct performance obligations. If these criteria are not met, the promises are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.

Determining the transaction price.

 

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring our goods and services to the customer. Determining the transaction price often requires judgment, based on an assessment of contractual terms and business practices. It further includes review of variable consideration such as discounts, sales returns, price protection, and rebates, which is estimated at the time of the transaction. In addition, the transaction price does not include an estimate of the variable consideration related to sales-based royalties. Sales-based royalties are recognized as the sales occur.

Allocating the transaction price. 

Allocating the transaction price requires that we determine an estimate of the relative stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. Determining the relative stand-alone selling price is inherently subjective, especially in situations where we do not sell the performance obligation on a stand-alone basis (which occurs in the majority of our transactions). In those situations, we determine the relative stand-alone selling price based on various observable inputs using all information that is reasonably available. Examples of observable inputs and information include: historical internal pricing data, cost plus margin analyses, third-party external pricing of similar or same products and services such as software licenses and maintenance support within the enterprise software industry. The results of our analysis resulted in a specific percentage of the transaction price being allocated to each performance obligation.

Determining the Estimated Offering Period.

 The offering period is the period in which we offer to provide the future update rights and/or online hosting for the game and related extra content sold.  Because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period, we must make an estimate of the offering period for the service related performance obligations (i.e., future update rights and online hosting). Determining the Estimated Offering Period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision. Generally, we consider the average period of time customers are online when estimating the offering period. We also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to the customer (i.e., time in channel). Based on these two factors, we then consider the method of distribution. For example, games 

29

Table of Contents

sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay period plus time in channel as opposed to digitally-distributed software licenses which are delivered immediately via digital download and therefore, the offering period is estimated to be only the online gameplay period.

Additionally, we consider results from prior analyses, known and expected online gameplay trends, as well as disclosed service periods for competitors’ games in determining the Estimated Offering Period for future sales.

 

We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of future update rights and online hosting to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our games are played. We recognize revenue for future update rights and online hosting performance obligations ratably on a straight-line basis over this period as there is a consistent pattern of delivery for these performance obligations. These performance obligations are generally recognized over an estimated nine-month period beginning in the month after shipment for software licenses sold through retail and an estimated six-month period for digitally-distributed software licenses beginning in the month of sale.

Principal Agent Considerations

We evaluate sales to end customers of our full games and related content via third-party storefronts, including digital storefronts such as Microsoft’s Xbox Store, Sony’s PlayStation Store, Apple App Store, and Google Play Store, in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal in the sale to the end customer, which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the third-party storefront. An entity is the principal if it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the end customer. Key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following:

•

the underlying contract terms and conditions between the various parties to the transaction;

•

which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to the end customer;

•

which party has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to the end customer; and

•

which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 

Based on an evaluation of the above indicators, except as discussed below, we have determined that generally the third party is considered the principal to end customers for the sale of our full games and related content. We therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront. However, for sales arrangements via Apple App Store and Google Play Store, EA is considered the principal to the end customer and thus, we report revenue on a gross basis and mobile platform fees are reported within cost of revenue.

Income Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both (1) the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (2) the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. It is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. Forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results. Therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment.

In addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income, we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets, namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments. Each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence and; this evaluation may involve assumptions about future activity. Certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets.

Every quarter, we perform a realizability analysis to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of March 31, 2020, we have recognized a $131 million valuation allowance related to our Swiss deferred tax assets. Our Swiss deferred tax asset realizability analysis relies upon future Swiss taxable income as the primary source of taxable income but considers all available sources of Swiss income based on the positive and negative evidence. We give more weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. However, there is significant judgment involved in estimating future Swiss taxable income over the 20-year period over which the Swiss deferred tax assets will reverse, specifically related to assumptions about expected growth rates of future Swiss taxable income, which are based primarily on 

30

Table of Contents

third party market and industry growth data. Actual results that differ materially from those estimates could have a material impact on our valuation allowance assessment. Although objectively verifiable, Swiss interest rates have an impact on the valuation allowance and are based on published Swiss guidance. Any significant changes to such interest rates could result in a material impact to the valuation allowance. Switzerland has a seven-year carryforward period and does not permit the carry back of losses. We do not recognize any deferred taxes related to the U.S. taxes on foreign earnings as we recognize these taxes as a period cost.

As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. This process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation, as well as with respect to other matters, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. The ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations. In addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Our results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 contained 52 weeks each and ended on March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. For simplicity of disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end.

Net Revenue

Net revenue consists of sales generated from (1) full games sold as digital downloads or as packaged goods and designed for play on game consoles and PCs, (2) full games for mobile phones and tablets, (3) live services associated with these games, such as extra content, (4) subscriptions that generally offer access to a selection of full games, in-game content, online services and other benefits, and (5) licensing our games to third parties to distribute and host our games.

 

Comparison of Fiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2019

Net Revenue

Net revenue for fiscal year 2020 was $

5,537

 million, primarily driven by 

FIFA 20, FIFA 19, The Sims 4, Apex Legends

 and 

Madden NFL 20

. Net revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased $587 million, as compared to fiscal year 2019. This increase was driven by a $924 million increase in revenue primarily from 

Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

 and 

Anthem

. This increase was partially offset by a $337 million decrease in revenue primarily from the Battlefield franchise.

 Net Revenue by Composition

As our business has evolved and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally, we have placed a significant emphasis and focus on assessing our business performance through a review of net revenue by composition, which is primarily based on method of distribution.

Our net revenue by composition for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):

Packaged Goods and Other Net Revenue

Packaged goods net revenue includes revenue from software that is distributed physically. This includes (1) net revenue from game software distributed physically through traditional channels such as brick and mortar retailers, and (2) our software licensing revenue from third parties (for example, makers of console platforms, personal computers or computer accessories) who include certain of our products for sale with their products (for example, OEM bundles). Other net revenue includes our non-software licensing revenue.

Packaged goods and other net revenue for fiscal year 2020 was $1,223 million, primarily driven by 

FIFA 20, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Madden NFL 20

, and 

FIFA 19

. Packaged goods and other net revenue remained relatively consistent for fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019.

Cost of revenue consists of (1) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements, (2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports leagues, movie studios and other organizations, and independent software developers, (3) data center, bandwidth and server costs associated with hosting our online games and websites, (4) inventory costs, (5) payment processing fees, (6) mobile platform fees associated with our mobile revenue (for transactions in which we are acting as the principal in the sale to the end customer), (7) expenses for defective products, (8) write-offs of post launch prepaid royalty costs and losses on previously unrecognized licensed intellectual property commitments, (9) amortization of certain intangible assets, (10) personnel-related costs, and (11) warehousing and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones); whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue increased by $47 million, or 4 percent during fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in inventory and royalty costs associated with 

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, 

an increase in royalty costs driven by higher sales associated with Madden franchise, a higher royalty rate associated with the FIFA franchise, and data center, bandwidth and server usage costs associated with 

Apex Legends

, partially offset by a decrease in inventory costs associated with 

Battlefield V 

and

 

the FIFA franchise,

 

and data center, bandwidth and server usage costs associated with

 Anthem

, which launched as online-only title during fiscal year 2019.

Cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by 2 percent during fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of our digital net revenues to packaged goods and other net revenues, which generally have higher costs than our digital games. 

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel-related costs, related overhead costs, external third-party development costs, contracted services, depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre-launch products. Research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. Research and development expenses also include expenses associated with our digital platform, software licenses and maintenance, and management overhead.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff, corporate functions such as finance, legal, human resources, and information technology, related overhead costs, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting, and allowances for doubtful accounts.

Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was negative 101.5 percent as compared to 5.6 percent for the same period in fiscal year 2019. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we completed an intra-entity sale of some of our intellectual property rights to our Swiss subsidiary, where our international business is headquartered (the “Swiss intra-entity sale”). The transaction did not result in a taxable gain. Under U.S. GAAP, any profit resulting from this intercompany transaction will be eliminated upon consolidation. However, the transaction resulted in a step-up of the Swiss tax-deductible basis in the transferred intellectual property rights and, accordingly, created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights (the “Swiss Deferred Tax Asset”). Our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were significantly impacted by our recognition of the Swiss Deferred Tax Asset related to the Swiss intra-entity sale.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we recognized a $1.840 billion Swiss Deferred Tax Asset, which is net of the impact of a $131 million valuation allowance and a $393 million reduction due to the impact of the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 

Altera Corp. v Commissioner

 (“the Altera opinion”). The Altera opinion also requires related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation expenses. The Altera opinion resulted in the recognition of a one-time charge of $80 million related to prior period U.S. uncertain tax positions during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. In total, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we recognized total one-time tax benefits of

Table of Contents

$1.760 billion related to the $1.840 billion Swiss Deferred Tax Asset, partially offset by the $80 million one-time Altera opinion charge.

Excluding the impacts of the Swiss Deferred Tax Asset and Altera opinion, our effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2020 would have been 15.0 percent, which was higher than the same periods in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to an increase in U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal year 2020.

Our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2021 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors, including changes in our business, such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions, our corporate structure, the geographic location of business functions or assets, the geographic mix of income, our agreements with tax authorities, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in our annual pre-tax income or loss. We anticipate that the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies may result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate in the future.

Changes in Cash Flow

Operating Activities.

 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $250 million during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by business performance related to the sales of 

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Need for Speed Heat, 

and 

Apex Legends, 

and improved collections during fiscal year 2020. The increase was partially offset by larger marketing and advertising payments for new titles, particularly 

Apex Legends 

and 

Anthem

, higher cash payments for income taxes, and higher royalty payments.

Investing Activities.

 Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,526 million during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by a $2,017 million increase in purchases of short-term investments. The increase was partially offset by a $454 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 and the payment of $58 million in connection with mergers and acquisitions activity during fiscal year 2019.

Table of Contents

Financing Activities.

 Net cash used in financing activities increased by $105 million during fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by the payment of $122 million of contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of Respawn

 

Entertainment, LLC and a $15 million increase in the repurchase and retirement of our common stock. These increases were partially offset by a $31 million decrease in cash paid to taxing authorities in connection with withholding taxes for stock-based compensation.

Short-term Investments

Due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities, our short-term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2020, our short-term investments had gross unrealized losses of $8 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short-term investments, and gross unrealized gains of $5 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short-term investments. From time to time, we may liquidate some or all of our short-term investments to fund operational needs or other activities, such as capital expenditures, business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs. 

Senior Notes

In February 2016, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes and $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. The effective interest rate is 3.94% for the 2021 Notes and 4.97% for the 2026 Notes. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2021 Notes are due on March 1, 2021. See 

Note 1

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K as it relates to our Senior Notes, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 7.

Credit Facility

On August 29, 2019, we entered into a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Facility terminates on August 29, 2024 unless the maturity is extended in accordance with its terms. As of March 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility. See 

Note 1

 — Financing Arrangements

 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K as it relates to our Credit Facility, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 7.

Financial Condition

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt repayment obligations, and potentially, future acquisitions, stock repurchases, or strategic investments. We may choose at any time to raise additional capital to repay debt, strengthen our financial position, facilitate expansion, repurchase our stock, pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, and/or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to capital markets and any additional capital could be difficult to obtain, expensive and/or not available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Such additional capital could also result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.

Our foreign subsidiaries will generally be subject to U.S. tax, and to the extent earnings from these subsidiaries can be repatriated without a material tax cost, such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested. As of March 31, 2020, approximately $4.4 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions, of which approximately $2.7 billion is available for repatriation without a material tax cost. 

We have a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, financing capital expenditures, research and development, marketing and distribution efforts, and if opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time.

Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and on the business of our key partners, customer demand and acceptance of our products, our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives, economic conditions in the United States and abroad, the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage, the impact of competition, the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results, and the other risks described in the “

Risk Factors

” section, included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As of March 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors.

INFLATION

We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years.
