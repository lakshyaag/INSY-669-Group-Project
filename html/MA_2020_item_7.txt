Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management’s judgment.  The significance of management’s estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition.  Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
