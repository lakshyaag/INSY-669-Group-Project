>Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices as the volatility of these prices continues to impact our industry. We expect commodity prices to remain volatile and unpredictable in the future. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. We employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these fluctuations. We are at risk for changes in the fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction. While the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – 

Note 16

 and 

Note 17

 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income and the related notional amounts.

Commodity Price Risk

Our strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. However, management will periodically protect prices on forecasted sales to support cash flow and liquidity, as deemed appropriate. We may use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, as part of an overall program to manage commodity price risk in our business. Our consolidated results for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were impacted by crude oil and natural gas derivatives related to a portion of our forecasted United States sales. 

As of December 31, 2020, we had various open commodity derivatives. Based on the December 31, 2020 published NYMEX WTI, natural gas and NGL futures prices, a hypothetical 10% change (per bbl for crude oil and NGL and per MMBtu for natural gas) would change the fair values of our $23 million net liability position to the following:

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2020 our portfolio of current and long-term debt is comprised of fixed-rate instruments with an outstanding balance of $5.4 billion.  Our sensitivity to interest rate movements and corresponding changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt portfolio affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices different than carrying value. 

At December 31, 2020, we had forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $670 million designated as cash flow hedges and $500 million not designated as hedges. We utilize cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing interest rate swap agreements to hedge variations in cash flows related to (1) the 1-month LIBOR component of future lease payments on our future Houston office and (2) the benchmark LIBOR index for our debt due in 2025. We de-designated the cash flow hedges related to our debt due in 2022 during the third quarter of 2020. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would change the fair values of our $3 million net asset position of our cash flow hedge and our $10 million net asset position of our de-designated cash flow hedge to the following as of December 31, 2020:

Counterparty Risk

We are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. If commodity prices fall below certain levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. We review the creditworthiness of counterparties and use master netting agreements when appropriate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

To the Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation:

Marathon Oil’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13(a) – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

An evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on the 2013 framework in 

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the results of this evaluation, Marathon Oil’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.

The effectiveness of Marathon Oil’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Marathon Oil Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate..

The Impact of Proved Oil and Condensate, Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) and Natural Gas Reserves on Proved Oil and Gas Properties, Net

As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated property, plant and equipment, net balance was $15,638 million as of December 31, 2020, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,316 million. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, capitalized costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves. As disclosed by management, reserve estimates may change as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. The data for a given reservoir may also change over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity and future development costs, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of future production volumes under varying economic conditions. The estimates of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves have been developed by specialists, specifically petroleum engineers and geoscientists.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves on proved oil and natural gas properties, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas reserves volumes.     

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimates of proved oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas reserves. The work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas 

reserve

 volumes. As a basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings. 

Impairment Assessment of the EG Holdings Equity Method Investment

As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded impairments of $171 million to its investment in an equity method investee, which was reflected in income (loss) from equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management assesses equity method investments for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss is deemed to have occurred and is other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income. Management estimated the fair value of the Company’s equity method investment using an income approach, specifically utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value was based on significant inputs not observable in the market, such as the amount of gas processed by the plant, future commodity prices, forecasted operating expenses, discount rate and estimated cash returned to shareholders.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessment of the EG Holdings equity method investment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the fair value measurement of the equity method investment and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumption related to the future gas volumes to be processed by the plant.    

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s impairment assessment of the EG Holdings equity method investment. These procedures also included, among 

57

others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analysis; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the analysis; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumption used by management related to the future gas volumes to be processed by the plant. The work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the natural gas reserve volumes as stated in the Critical Audit Matter titled “Impact of Proved Oil and Condensate, Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs), and Natural Gas Reserves on Proved Oil and Gas Properties, Net” and the reasonableness of the future gas volumes to be processed by the plant. As a basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the analysis and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings.

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. 

Summary of Principal Accounting Policies

We are an independent exploration and production company engaged in exploration, production and marketing of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas; as well as production and marketing of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.

Basis of presentation and principles applied in consolidation 

– These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our controlled subsidiaries. Investments in unincorporated joint ventures and undivided interests in certain operating assets are consolidated on a pro rata basis.

Equity method investments

 

– Investments in entities over which we have significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. This includes entities in which we hold majority ownership but the minority stockholders have substantive participating rights in the investee. Income from equity method investments represents our proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method investees and is reflected in revenues and other income in our consolidated statements of income. Equity method investments are included as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss is deemed to have occurred and is other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income.

 

Use of estimates

 

– The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods.

Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves is a significant estimate that requires judgment. All of the reserve data included in this Form 10-K are estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. See unaudited Supplementary Data – 

Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities

 

for further detail.

Other items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, asset retirement obligations, goodwill, valuation of derivative instruments and valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, among others. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Foreign currency transactions

 – The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our foreign operating subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income.

Revenue recognition

 – Revenues associated with the sales of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas are recognized when our performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point where control transfers to the customer based on contract terms. Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. Our hydrocarbon sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include quality or location differential adjustments. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. 

We typically incur shipping and handling costs prior to control transferring to the customer and account for these activities as fulfillment costs. These costs are reflected in shipping, handling and other operating expense in our consolidated statement of income.

Our U.S. production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas is generally sold immediately and transported to market. In our international segment, liquid hydrocarbon production may be stored as inventory and sold at a later time.

Cash and cash equivalents

 – Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

Accounts receivable

 – The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. We often have the 

64

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings. We conduct credit reviews of commodity purchasers prior to making commodity sales to new customers or increasing credit for existing customers. Based on these reviews, we may require a standby letter of credit or a financial guarantee. We routinely assess the collectability of receivable balances to determine if the amount of the reserve in allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient.

 

Inventories

 – Crude oil and natural gas are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular goods and equipment, which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsol

escence or impairment when market conditions indicate

. 

We may enter into a contract to sell a particular quantity and quality of crude oil at a specified location and date to a particular counterparty, and simultaneously agree to buy a particular quantity and quality of the same commodity at a specified location on the same or another specified date from the same counterparty. We account for such matching buy/sell arrangements as exchanges of inventory.

Derivative instruments

 – We may use derivatives to manage a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk, commodity locational risk and interest rate risk. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value. Commodity derivatives and interest rate swaps are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet on a net basis by counterparty, as they are governed by master netting agreements. Cash flows related to derivatives used to manage commodity price risk, and interest rate risk are classified in operating activities. Our derivative instruments contain no significant contingent credit features.

Fair value hedges

 – We may use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with fixed interest rate debt in our portfolio. Changes in the fair values of both the hedged item and the related derivative are recognized immediately in net income with an offsetting effect included in the basis of the hedged item. The net effect is to report in net income the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

Cash flow hedges

 

– We may use interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk of interest rate changes during the period prior to anticipated borrowings as well as to stabilize future lease payments on our future Houston office, and designate them as cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are linked to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The changes in the fair value of a qualifying cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects earnings and are then reclassified into net income. Beginning in 2019, ineffective portions of a cash flow hedge are no longer measured or disclosed separately. However, if it is determined that the likelihood of the original forecasted transaction occurring is no longer probable or the cash flow hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivatives instrument are recorded in net income.

Derivatives not designated as hedges

 – Derivatives that are not designated as hedges may include commodity derivatives used primarily to manage price and locational risks on the forecasted sale of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that we produce. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in net income

. 

Concentrations of credit risk

 – All of our financial instruments, including derivatives, involve elements of credit and market risk. The most significant portion of our credit risk relates to nonperformance by counterparties. The counterparties to our financial instruments consist primarily of major financial institutions and companies within the energy industry. To manage counterparty risk associated with financial instruments, we select and monitor counterparties based on our assessment of their financial strength and on credit ratings, if available. Additionally, we limit the level of exposure with any single counterparty.

Fair value transfer

 – We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period.

Property, plant and equipment 

– We use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities.

Property acquisition costs

 – Costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and natural gas properties, to drill exploratory wells in progress and those that find proved reserves and to drill development wells are capitalized. Costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves but cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (2) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. The status of suspended exploratory well costs is monitored continuously and reviewed at least quarterly.

65

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

 – Capitalized costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves. Support equipment and other property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas producing activities, as well as property, plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing activities, are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

The table below summarizes these assets by type, useful life and the gross asset balance as of the periods presented.

Impairments

 – We evaluate our oil and gas producing properties, including capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs, for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. Oil and gas producing properties are reviewed for impairment on a field-by-field basis or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. Oil and gas producing properties deemed to be impaired are written down to their fair value, as determined by discounted future net cash flows or, if available, comparable market value. We evaluate our unproved property investment and record impairment based on time or geologic factors. Information such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage is also considered. When unproved property investments are deemed to be impaired, this amount is reported in exploration expenses in our consolidated statements of income.

Dispositions

 – When property, plant and equipment depreciated on an individual basis is sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are reflected in net gain (loss) on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of income. Gains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the time of closing. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized either when the assets are classified as held for sale, or are measured using a probability weighted income approach based on both the anticipated sales price and a held-for-use model depending on timing of the sale. Proceeds from the disposal of a portion of property, plant and equipment depreciated on a group basis are credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization with no immediate effect on net income until net book value is reduced to zero.

Goodwill

 – Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of a business. Such goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below carrying value. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and other assets and liabilities to a reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then the recorded goodwill is impaired to its implied fair value with a charge to impairments.

 

Environmental costs

 – We provide for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of remediation accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the commitment to a formal plan of action. Remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure and are discounted when the estimated amounts are reasonably fixed or reliably determinable. Environmental expenditures are capitalized only if the costs mitigate or prevent future contamination or if the costs improve the environmental safety or efficiency of the existing assets.

Asset retirement obligations

 – The fair value of asset retirement obligations is recognized in the period in which the obligations are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas producing facilities. Asset retirement obligations for such facilities include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of production platforms, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land, including those leased. Estimates of these costs are developed for each property based on the type of production facilities and equipment, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals.

66

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are used to estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations. Depreciation of capitalized asset retirement costs and accretion of asset retirement obligations are recorded over time. Depreciation is generally determined on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves for oil and gas production facilities, while accretion of the liability occurs over the useful lives of the assets

.

 

Deferred income taxes

 – Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as reported in our filings with the respective taxing authorities. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on several interrelated factors and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. These factors include whether we are in a cumulative loss position in recent years, our reversal of temporary differences, and our expectation to generate sufficient future taxable income. We use the liability method in determining our provision and liabilities for our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates.

 

Stock-based compensation arrangements

 – The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model employs various assumptions, based on management’s best estimates at the time of grant, which impact the calculation of fair value and ultimately, the amount of expense that is recognized over the life of the stock option award. Of the required assumptions, the expected volatility of our stock price and the stock price in relation to the strike price have the most significant impact on the fair value calculation. We have utilized historical data and analyzed current information which reasonably support these assumptions.

The fair value of our restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and Director restricted stock units is determined based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and Director restricted stock units are removed from Treasury Stock at grant, vesting and distribution, respectively.

The fair value of our cash-settled stock-based performance units is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Since these awards are settled in cash at the end of a defined performance period, they are classified as a liability and are re-measured quarterly until settlement. The fair value of our stock-settled stock-based performance units is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation method at grant date only. Since these awards are settled in stock, they are classified as equity.

Our stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on management’s best estimate of the awards that are expected to vest, using the straight-line attribution method for all service-based awards with a graded vesting feature. If actual forfeiture results are different than expected, adjustments to recognized compensation expense may be required in future periods.

Accounting Standards

Recently Adopted

Financial instruments – credit losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standards update that changes the impairment model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other instruments. On January 1, 2020 we adopted this standard using the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment of $

12

 million to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking “expected loss” model as opposed to the “incurred loss” model used previously. See 

Note 9

 for more information on credit losses.

Acquisitions 

United States Segment 

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired approximately 

40,000

 net acres in a Texas Delaware oil play in West Texas from multiple sellers for $

106

 million. We accounted for these transactions as an asset acquisition, allocating the purchase price to unproved property within property, plant and equipment. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired a 

100

% working interest in approximately 

18,000

 net acres in the Eagle Ford from Rocky Creek Resources, LLC and RCR Midstream, LLC for $

191

 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. We accounted for this transaction as a business combination, with the entire purchase price allocated between proved property, unproved property and other assets, all within property, plant and equipment.

    The fair values of the assets acquired were measured using the market approach, specifically the market comparable technique. The fair values were based on market-corroborated inputs, which were derived from observable market data; such inputs represent Level 2 inputs. As the acquisition date was December 31, 2019, there is not a pro forma effect of this transaction on our consolidated statement of income.

 

5. 

Dispositions

United States Segment 

In the third quarter of 2018, we closed on the sale of non-core, non-operated conventional properties, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, for combined net proceeds of $

16

 million, before closing adjustments. A pre-tax gain of $

32

 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2018. 

International Segment

On July 1, 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business (Marathon Oil U.K. LLC and Marathon Oil West of Shetlands Limited) for proceeds of $

95

 million which reflects the assumption by RockRose Energy PLC (“RockRose”) of the U.K. business’ cash equivalent balance and working capital balance as of year-end 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a $

6

 million liability and corresponding expense related to the estimated fair value of our exposure to surety bonds we continued to hold that guaranteed decommissioning liabilities of Marathon Oil U.K. LLC. In November 2019, RockRose posted replacement security and accordingly, we reversed the aforementioned $

6

 million (see 

Note 26

 for further detail). Income before taxes relating to our U.K. business for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $

33

 million and $

261

 million, respectively. See 

Note 13

 and 

Note 20

 for additional details on U.K. ARO and the defined benefit pension plan as it relates to this disposition. 

In the second quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our 

15

% non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan for proceeds of $

63

 million, before closing adjustments. 

68

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In the first quarter of 2018, we closed on the sale of our subsidiary, Marathon Oil Libya Limited, which held our 

16.33

% non-operated interest in the Waha concessions in Libya, to a subsidiary of Total S.A. (Elf Aquitaine SAS) for proceeds of approximately $

450

 million, excluding closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $

255

 million.

 

6. 

Revenues

The majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas under spot and term agreements with our customers in the United States and various international locations.

As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, receivables from contracts with customers, included in receivables, less reserves were $

572

 million and $

837

 million, respectively.

In 2020, sales to Marathon Petroleum Corporation and Koch Resources LLC and each of their respective affiliates, accounted for approximately 

13

% and 

12

%, respectively, of our total revenues. In 2019, sales to Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Koch Resources LLC, Valero Marketing and Supply and Shell Trading and their respective affiliates, accounted for approximately 

13

%, 

13

%, 

11

% and 

10

%, respectively, of our total revenues. In 2018, sales to Valero Marketing and Supply and Koch Resources LLC and their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately 

11

% of our total revenues. 

The pricing in our hydrocarbon sales agreements are variable, determined using various published benchmarks which are adjusted for negotiated quality and location differentials. As a result, revenue collected under our agreements with customers is highly dependent on the market conditions and may fluctuate considerably as the hydrocarbon market prices rise or fall. Typically, our customers pay us monthly, within a short period of time after we deliver the hydrocarbon products. As such, we do not have any financing element associated with our contracts. We do not have any issues related to returns or refunds, as product specifications are standardized for the industry and are typically measured when transferred to a common carrier or midstream entity, and other contractual mechanisms (e.g., price adjustments) are used when products do not meet those specifications. 

70

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In limited cases, we may also collect advance payments from customers as stipulated in our agreements; payments in excess of recognized revenue are recorded as contract liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. 

Under our hydrocarbon sales agreements, the entire consideration amount is variable either due to pricing and/or volumes. We recognize revenue in the amount of variable consideration allocated to distinct units of hydrocarbons transferred to a customer. Such allocation reflects the amount of total consideration we expect to collect for completed deliveries of hydrocarbons and the terms of variable payment relate specifically to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligations under these contracts. Our performance obligations under our hydrocarbon sales agreements are to deliver either the entire production from the dedicated wells or specified contractual volumes of hydrocarbons.

We often serve as the operator for jointly owned oil and gas properties. As part of this role, we perform activities to explore, develop and produce oil and gas properties in accordance with the joint operating arrangements. Other working interest owners reimburse us for costs incurred based on our agreements. We determined that these activities are not performed as part of customer relationships and such reimbursements will continue to not be recorded as revenues within the scope of the revenue accounting standard.

In addition, we commonly market the share of production belonging to other working interest owners as the operator of jointly owned oil and gas properties. We concluded that those marketing activities are carried out as part of the collaborative arrangement. Therefore, we act as a principal only in regards to the sale of our share of production and recognize revenue for the volumes associated with our net production.

Crude oil and condensate

For the crude sales agreements, we satisfy our performance obligations and recognize revenue once customers take control of the crude at the designated delivery points, which include pipelines, trucks or vessels. 

Natural gas and NGLs 

When selling natural gas and NGLs, we engage midstream entities to process our production stream by separating natural gas from the NGLs. Frequently, these midstream entities also purchase our natural gas and NGLs under the same agreements. In these situations, we determined the performance obligation is complete and satisfied at the tailgate of the processing plant when the natural gas and NGLs become identifiable and measurable products. We determined the plant tailgate is the point in time where control is transferred to midstream entities and they are entitled to significant risks and rewards of ownership of the natural gas and NGLs. 

 The amounts due to midstream entities for gathering and processing services are recognized as shipping and handling cost, since we make those payments in exchange for distinct services. Under some of our natural gas processing agreements, we have an option to take the processed natural gas and NGLs in-kind and sell to customers other than the processing company. In those circumstances, our performance obligations are complete after delivering the processed hydrocarbons to the customer at the designated delivery points, which may be the tailgate of the processing plant or an alternative delivery point requested by the customer. 

We have “percentage-of-proceeds” arrangements with some midstream entities where they retain a percentage of the proceeds collected for selling our processed natural gas and NGLs as compensation for their processing and marketing services. We recognize revenue for the gross sales volumes and recognize the proceeds retained by midstream companies as shipping and handling cost.

Segment Information

We have 

two

 reportable operating segments. Both of these segments are organized and managed based upon geographic location and the nature of the products and services offered.

•

United States (“U.S.”) – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States

•

International (“Int’l”) – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.

Segment income represents income which excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. A portion of our corporate and operations general and administrative support costs are not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect

comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, certain exploration expenses relating to a strategic decision to exit conventional exploration, unrealized gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments, or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not allocated to operating segments.

Includes income tax benefits primarily related to our U.S. federal income taxes where we have maintained a full valuation allowance since December 2016.

The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is reported in the “Not Allocated to Segments” column of the tables in 

Note 7

.

Effects of foreign operations

 – The effects of foreign operations increased our tax expense in 2020 largely due to book losses in foreign jurisdictions with no corresponding tax benefits. The effects of foreign operations decreased our tax expense in 2019 due to tax benefits related to our U.K. operations and pre-tax income in jurisdictions with effective tax rates lower than the U.S. The effects of foreign operations increased our tax expense in 2018 due to the mix of pre-tax income between high and low tax jurisdictions, including Libya where the tax rate was 93.5%. Excluding Libya, the effective tax rate would have been an expense of 

14

% in 2018. As a result of the sale of our Libya subsidiary in the first quarter of 2018, we do not expect to incur further tax expense related to Libya. 

Adjustments to valuation allowances

 – 

Since December 31, 2016, we have maintained a full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets. In all years, the most significant driver for the change in valuation allowance was due to current year activity in the U.S.

Other federal tax effects

 – In 2020, the increase to other federal tax effects is largely related to non-deductible goodwill impairment. The 2019 decrease in other federal tax effects is primarily related to the settlement of the 2010-2011 U.S. Federal Tax Audit (“IRS Audit”) in the first quarter of 2019. The release of the accrued tax positions resulted in a $

126

 million tax benefit, primarily related to AMT credits.

If the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 were recognized, $

8

 million would affect our effective income tax rate. As of December 31, 2020, we do not expect uncertain tax positions to significantly change within the next twelve months. During the first quarter of 2019, we withdrew our appeal related to the Brae area decommissioning costs in the U.K., thus the uncertain tax positions previously established are now considered effectively settled with no tax expense or benefit impact. Also, in the first quarter of 2019, we settled the 2010-2011 IRS Audit, resulting in a tax benefit of $

126

 million. 

Interest and penalties are recorded as part of the tax provision and were a $

2

 million tax benefit in 2020 and a $

6

 million and $

2

 million tax expense in 2019 and 2018 related to unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had no significant accrued interest or penalties related to income taxes. For December 31, 2019, $

3

 million of interest and penalties were accrued related to income taxes.

In the third quarter of 2020, we received an $

89

 million cash refund related to alternative minimum tax credits and interest.  This refund was accelerated as a result of the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, commonly referred to as the CARES Act, in the first quarter of 2020.

Credit Losses

The majority of our receivables are from purchasers of commodities or joint interest owners in properties we operate, both of which are recorded at estimated or invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the collectability of our receivables and estimate the expected credit losses using historical data, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. 

We are exposed to credit losses through the receivables generated from sales of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to our customers. When dealing with the commodity purchasers, we conduct a credit review to assess each counterparty’s ability to pay. The credit review considers our expected billing exposure, timing for payment and the counterparty’s established credit rating with the rating agencies or our internal assessment of the counterparty’s creditworthiness based on our analysis of their financial statements. Our evaluation also considers contract terms and other factors, such as country and/or political risk. A credit limit is established for each counterparty based on the outcome of this review. We may require a bank letter of credit or a prepayment to mitigate credit risk. We monitor our ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty balances against contract terms and due dates. The expected credit losses related to receivables with the commodity purchasers were determined using the weighted average probability of default method.  We also collect revenues from our non-operated joint properties where other oil and gas exploration and production companies operate the properties and market our share of production and remit payments to us. The current expected credit losses related to these receivables were determined using the loss rate method applied to aging pools. 

We are exposed to credit losses from joint interest billings to other joint interest owners for properties we operate. For this group of receivables, the expected credit losses are determined using the loss rate method applied to aging pools. Our counterparties in this group include numerous large, mid-size and small oil and gas exploration and production companies.  Although we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings or require a prepayment of future costs through cash calls, our credit loss exposure with this group is more significant due to inherent ownership or billing adjustments. Also, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. Liquidity problems may increase in the future if hydrocarbon demand and/

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

At December 31, 2020, we had $

98

 million of exploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year related to suspended wells. Management believes these wells exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. The vast majority of the suspended wells require completion activities and installation of infrastructure in order to classify the reserves as proved. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 we had $

30

 million and $

6

 million of exploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year.

 

12. 

Impairments

During the first quarter of 2020, a global pandemic caused a substantial deterioration in the worldwide demand of hydrocarbons. The decreased demand, when coupled with an oversupplied market, caused a corresponding deterioration in hydrocarbon prices. We reviewed our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment during the first quarter by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the most impactful inputs to their undiscounted cash flows, including commodity prices, capital spend and reductions in production volumes to correspond with lower capital spending.

 

Our review concluded that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets are recoverable; however, further deterioration or a more sustained decline of commodity prices may result in impairment charges in future periods.  

We also reviewed our equity method investments for indicators of impairment. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss in value occurs that is deemed other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value.  During the second and third quarters of 2020, we recognized impairments related to one of our EG Holdings equity method investments, as noted in the tables and further described below.

The following table summarizes impairment charges of proved properties, goodwill and equity method investments and their corresponding fair values.

2020 

– Impairments totaling $

49

 million of long-lived assets held for use resulted from a damaged, unsalvageable well and related equipment in the Louisiana Austin Chalk. The related fair value was measured based on the salvage value which resulted in a Level 3 classification. 

We impaired the entire balance of our goodwill in the International reporting unit totaling $

95

 million of goodwill. See 

Note 15

 for further information.  

Impairments also include charges recognized for our equity method investments of $

171

 million. During the second and third quarters of 2020, the continuation of the depressed commodity prices, along with a reduction of our long-term price forecasts of a gas index in which one of our equity method investees transacts, caused us to perform a review of one of our equity method investments. Our review concluded that a loss of our investment value in one was other than temporary and we recorded an impairment. Our remaining investments in equity method investees did not experience losses in value that caused the fair values to be below their carrying values.

We estimated the fair value of our equity method investment using an income approach, specifically utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value was based on significant inputs not observable in the market, such as the amount of gas processed by the plant, future commodity prices, forecasted operating expenses, discount rate and estimated cash returned to shareholders. Collectively, these inputs represent Level 3 measurements.

The impairments of our equity method investments were recognized in income (loss) from equity method investments in our consolidated statements of income. The impairments caused us to incur a basis differential between the net book value of our investment and the amount of our underlying share of equity in the investee’s net assets. The amount of this basis differential was $

140

 million and is being accreted into income over the remaining useful life of the investee’s primary assets.

Finally, we impaired $

78

 million of unproved property leases in Louisiana Austin Chalk in our United States segment which was recognized in exploration expense in our consolidated statements of income. The impairment resulted from a combination of factors including our geological assessment, seismic information, timing of lease expiration dates and decisions not to develop acreage deemed non-core. Collectively, these inputs represent Level 3 measurements.

In determining our ROU assets and long-term lease liabilities, the lease standard requires certain accounting policy decisions, while also providing a number of optional practical expedients for transition accounting. Our accounting policies and the practical expedients utilized are summarized below:

•

Implemented an accounting policy to not recognize any right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to short-term leases on the balance sheet. 

•

Implemented an accounting policy to not separate the lease and nonlease components for all asset classes, except for vessels.

•

Elected the package of practical expedients which allows us to not reassess our prior conclusions regarding the lease identification and lease classification for contracts that commenced or expired prior to the effective date. 

•

Elected the practical expedient pertaining to land easements which allows us to continue accounting for existing agreements under the previous accounting policies as nonlease transactions. Any modifications of existing contracts or new agreements will be assessed under the new lease accounting guidance and may become leases in the future.

We enter into various lease agreements to support our operations including drilling rigs, well fracturing equipment, compressors, buildings, aircraft, vessels, vehicles and miscellaneous field equipment. We primarily act as a lessee in these transactions and the majority of our existing leases are classified as either short-term or long-term operating leases. 

The majority of the drilling rig agreements and all of fracturing equipment agreements are classified as short-term leases based on the noncancellable period for which we have the right to use the equipment and assessment of options present in each agreement. We also incur variable lease costs under these agreements primarily related to chemicals and sand used in fracturing operations or various additional on-demand equipment and labor. The lease costs associated with the drilling rigs and fracturing equipment are primarily capitalized as part of the well costs. 

Our long-term leases are comprised of compressors, buildings, drilling rigs, aircraft, vessels, vehicles and miscellaneous field equipment. Our lease agreements may require both fixed and variable payments; none of the variable payments are rate or index-based, therefore only fixed payments were considered for recognizing lease liabilities and ROU assets related to long-term leases. Also, based on our election not to separate the lease and nonlease components, fixed payments related to equipment, crew and other nonlease components are included in the initial measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets for all asset classes, except for vessels. For vessels, the contractual consideration was allocated between lease and nonlease components based on estimates provided by service providers.

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

    

Our leased assets may be used in joint oil and gas operations with other working interest owners. We recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets only when we are the signatory to a contract as an operator of joint properties. Such lease liabilities and ROU assets are determined based on gross contractual obligations. As we use the leased assets for joint operations, we have the contractual right to recover the other working interest owners’ share of lease costs. As a result, our lease costs are presented on a net basis, reduced for any costs recoverable from other working interest owners. 

The table below presents our net lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 with the majority of operating lease costs expensed as incurred, while the majority of the short-term and variable lease costs are capitalized into property, plant and equipment.

In 2018, we signed an agreement with an owner/lessor to construct and lease a new build-to-suit office building in Houston, Texas. The lessor and other participants are providing financing for up to $

340

 million, to fund the estimated project costs, 

which was reduced effective August 2020, from 

$

380

 million

 to align with our revised estimate of the project costs.

 As of December 31, 2020, project costs incurred totaled approximately $

144

 million. The initial lease term is 

five years

 and will commence once construction is substantially complete and the new Houston office is ready for occupancy. At the end of the initial lease term, we can negotiate to extend the lease term for an additional 

five years

, subject to the approval of the participants; purchase the property subject to certain terms and conditions; or remarket the property to an unrelated third party. The lease contains a residual value guarantee of approximately 

89

% of the total acquisition and construction costs.

 

15. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value may have been reduced below its carrying value. During the first quarter of 2020, a global pandemic caused a substantial deterioration in the worldwide demand of hydrocarbons. This demand loss resulted in a significant decline in hydrocarbon prices. The commensurate decline in our market capitalization during the first quarter indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the International reporting unit was less than its carrying value. 

We estimated the fair value of our International reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches. The market approach referenced observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value and valuation multiples of us and peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilized discounted cash flows, which were based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach include future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas pricing, estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas proved and probable reserves, estimated timing of production, discount rates, future capital requirements, operating expenses and tax rates. The assumptions used in the income approach are consistent with those that management uses to make business decisions. These valuation methodologies represent Level 3 fair value measurements. Based on the results, we concluded our goodwill was fully impaired, and recorded an impairment of $

95

 million in the consolidated statements of income for the first quarter of 2020.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges

Commodity Derivatives

We have entered into multiple crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives indexed to the respective indices as noted in the table below, related to a portion of our forecasted United States sales through 2021. These derivatives consist of three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps, basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. Two-way collars only consist of a sold call (ceiling) and a purchased put (floor). These crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives were not designated as hedges.

Interest Rate Swaps 

During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variations in cash flows as a result of fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future d

ebt issuance in 2022.  Each respective derivative contract can be tied to an anticipated underlying dollar notional amount. During the third quarter of 2020, we de-designated these forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2020, accumulated other comprehensive income included a net deferred loss of $

2

 million related to the de-designated forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges. No portion of this amount has been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2020. We expect to reclassify this amount into earnings as an adjustment to net interest and other upon the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

The following table presents, by maturity date, information about our de-designated forward starting interest rate swap agreements, including the rate.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

During 2020, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $

350

 million to hedge variations in cash flows arising from fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate related to forecasted interest payments of a future debt issuance in 2025. We expect to refinance these debt maturities in 2025. The swaps will terminate on or prior to the refinancing of the debt and the final value will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings with each future interest payment.

During 2019, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $

320

 million to hedge variations in cash flows related to the 1-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) component of future lease payments of our future Houston office. These swaps will settle monthly on the same day the lease payment is made with the first swap settlement occurring in January 2022. We expect the first lease payment to commence sometime in the period from December 2021 to May 2022. The last swap will mature in September 2026. See 

Note 14

 

for further details regarding the lease of the new Houston office.

Derivative instruments are recorded on a net basis in our consolidated balance sheet (See 

Note 16

)

.

Commodity derivatives include three-way collars, two-way collars, fixed price swaps, basis swaps and NYMEX roll basis swaps. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For swaps, inputs to the models include only commodity prices and interest rates and are categorized as Level 1 because all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. For three-way collars and two-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices, and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments.

The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See 

Note 16

 for details on the forward starting interest swaps.  

Fair Values – Goodwill

See 

Note 15

 

for detail information relating to goodwill.

Fair Values – Nonrecurring

See 

Note 5

 and 

Note 12

 for detail on our fair values for nonrecurring items, such as impairments.

Fair Values – Financial Instruments 

Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificance of bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk.

Fair values of our notes receivable and our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value.

All of our long-term debt instruments are publicly traded. A market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair value of our debt.

Debt

Revolving Credit Facility 

As of December 31, 2020, we had 

no

 borrowings on our $

3.0

 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”).  The Credit Facility matures on May 28, 2023 and we retain the ability to request two one-year extensions of the maturity date. 

The Credit Facility includes a single financial covenant requiring that our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not exceed 

65

% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. This covenant calculation was modified in December 2020, when we executed the fifth amendment to our credit facility. The primary changes resulting from this amendment are (i) a modification to the debt to total capitalization covenant calculation that permits an add-back to shareholders’ equity for certain non-cash write-downs, (ii) the addition of certain customary events of default, including a cross payment event of default and (iii) certain restrictions on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness. Under the amended definition, our total debt to total capitalization ratio was 

26

% at December 31, 2020. 

If an event of default occurs, the lenders holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility.

Incentive Based Compensation

Description of stock-based compensation plans 

– The Marathon Oil Corporation 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2019 Plan”) was approved by our stockholders in May 2019 and authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards), performance unit awards and cash awards to employees. The 2019 Plan also allows us to provide equity compensation to our non-employee directors. No more than 

27.9

 million shares of our common stock may be issued under the 2019 Plan. In connection with the granting of an award under the 2019 Plan, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan will be reduced by one share for each share of our common stock in respect of which the award is granted, except the awards that by their terms do not permit settlement in shares of our common stock will not reduce the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.

Shares subject to awards under the 2019 Plan that are forfeited, terminated or expire unexercised become available for future grants. In addition, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will not be increased by shares tendered to satisfy the purchase price of an award, exchanged for other awards or withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Shares issued as a result of awards granted under the 2019 Plan are generally funded out of common stock held in treasury, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new common shares are issued.

After approval of the 2019 Plan, no new grants were or will be made from any prior plans. Any awards previously granted under any prior plans shall continue to be exercisable in accordance with their original terms and conditions. 

Stock-based awards under the plans

Stock options

 – We grant stock options under the 2019 Plan. Our stock options represent the right to purchase shares of our common stock at its fair market value on the date of grant. In general, our stock options vest ratably over a 

three-year

 period and have a maximum term of 

ten years

 from the date they are granted.

SARs 

– At December 31, 2020, there are 

no

 SARs outstanding.

Restricted stock

 

– We grant restricted stock under the 2019 Plan. The restricted stock awards granted to officers generally vest 

three years

 from the date of grant, contingent on the recipient’s continued employment. We also grant restricted stock to certain non-officer employees based on their performance within certain guidelines and for retention purposes. The restricted stock awards to non-officers generally vest ratably over a 

three-year

 period, contingent on the recipient’s continued employment. Prior to vesting, all restricted stock recipients have the right to vote such stock and receive dividends thereon. The non-vested shares of restricted stock are not transferable and are held by our transfer agent. 

Stock-based performance units

 – We grant stock-based performance units to officers under the 2019 Plan. At the grant date, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. These units are settled in shares, and the number of shares of our common stock to be paid is based on the vesting percentage, which can be from 

zero

 to 

200

% based on performance achieved over a three-year performance period, and as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The performance goals are tied to our total shareholder return (“TSR”) as compared to TSR for a group of peer companies determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Dividend equivalents may accrue during the performance period and would be paid in cash at the end of the performance period based on the amount of dividends credited generally over the performance period on shares of our common stock that represent the value of the units granted multiplied by the vesting percentage.

Restricted stock units 

– We maintain an equity compensation program for our non-employee directors. All non-employee directors receive annual grants of common stock units. Any units granted prior to 2012 must be held until completion of board service, at which time the non-employee director will receive common shares. For units granted between 2012 and 2016, common shares will generally vest following completion of board service or three years from the date of grant, whichever is earlier.  For awards issued in 2017 and later, directors may elect to defer settlement of their common stock units until after they cease serving on the Board. Absent such an election to defer, common shares will vest upon the earlier of three years from the date of grant or completion of board service. Under the 2019 Plan, we also grant restricted stock units to officers, which generally vest 

three years

 from the date of the grant and restricted stock units to certain non-officer employees, which generally vest ratably over a 

three-year

 period.  Both awards are contingent on the recipient’s continued employment. Grants of restricted stock units to these non-officer employees are generally based on their performance and for retention purposes. Common shares will be issued for these restricted stock units after vesting. Prior to vesting, recipients of restricted stock units typically receive dividend equivalent payments, but they may not vote. 

Total stock-based compensation expense

 – Total employee stock-based compensation expense was $

55

 million, $

60

 million and $

53

 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Due to the full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets, we recognized no tax benefit during these years. Cash received upon exercise of stock option awards was less than $

Defined Benefit Postretirement Plans and Defined Contribution Plan

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees. Benefits under these plans are based on plan provisions specific to each plan.

 We also had a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering eligible U.K. employees that was transferred to the buyer in connection with the sale of our U.K. business during 2019. See 

Note 5

 for further information on this disposition. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we reclassified $

20

 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to pension assets upon remeasurement of the plan.

We also have plans for other postretirement benefits covering our U.S. employees. Health care benefits are provided up to age 65 through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical benefit provisions subject to various cost-sharing features. Post-65 retiree health care benefits have been provided to certain U.S. employees on a defined contribution basis; this program terminated effective as of December 31, 2020. Life insurance benefits are provided to certain retiree beneficiaries. These other postretirement benefits are not funded in advance. Employees hired after 2016 are not eligible for any postretirement health care or life insurance benefits.

Expected long-term return on plan assets

 – The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. pension plan is determined based on an internally developed asset rate-of-return modeling tool which utilizes underlying assumptions based on actual returns by asset category and inflation and takes into account our U.S. pension plan’s asset allocation.  The expected return for each asset category is then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the overall expected long-term return on plan assets assumption.

Assumed weighted average health care cost trend rates

Employer provided subsidies for post-65 retiree health care coverage were frozen effective January 1, 2017 at January 1, 2016 established amount levels. Company contributions are funded to a Health Reimbursement Account on the retiree’s behalf to subsidize the retiree’s cost of obtaining health care benefits through a private exchange (the “post-65 retiree health benefits”). 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we terminated the post-65 retiree health benefits effective as of December 31, 2020. The post-65 retiree health benefits will no longer be provided after that date. In addition, the pre-65 retiree medical coverage subsidy was frozen as of January 1, 2019, and the ability for retirees to opt in and out of this coverage, as well as pre-65 retiree dental and vision coverage, was also eliminated. Retirees must enroll in connection with retirement for such coverage, or they lose eligibility. These plan changes reduced our retiree medical benefit obligation by approximately $

99

 million at December 31, 2018.

Plan investment policies and strategies

 – The investment policies for our U.S. pension plan assets reflect the funded status of the plan and expectations regarding our future ability to make further contributions. Long-term investment goals are to: (1) manage the assets in accordance with applicable legal requirements; (2) produce investment returns which meet or exceed the rates of return achievable in the capital markets while maintaining the risk parameters set by the plan’s investment committees and protecting the assets from any erosion of purchasing power; and (3) position the portfolios with a long-term risk/return orientation. Investment performance and risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment meetings and periodic asset and liability studies.

U.S. plan

 – The plan’s current targeted asset allocation is comprised of 

55

% equity securities and 

45

% other fixed income securities. Over time, as the plan’s funded ratio (as defined by the investment policy) improves, in order to reduce volatility in returns and to better match the plan’s liabilities, the allocation to equity securities will decrease while the amount allocated to fixed income securities will increase. The plan’s assets are managed by a third-party investment manager. 

International plan

 – As mentioned above, the plan covering eligible U.K. employees that was transferred to the buyer in connection with the sale of our U.K. business during 2019. 

Fair value measurements

 – Plan assets are measured at fair value. The following provides a description of the valuation techniques employed for each major plan asset class at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Cash and cash equivalents

 –

 Cash and cash equivalents are valued using a market approach and are considered Level 1. 

Equity securities

 

–

 

Investments in common stock are valued using a market approach at the closing price reported in an active market and are therefore considered Level 1. Private equity investments include interests in limited partnerships which 

96

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

are valued based on the sum of the estimated fair values of the investments held by each partnership, determined using a combination of market, income and cost approaches, plus working capital, adjusted for liabilities, currency translation and estimated performance incentives. These private equity investments are considered Level 3. 

Fixed income securities

 

– Fixed income securities are valued using a market approach. U.S. treasury notes and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are valued at the closing price reported in an active market and are considered Level 1. Corporate bonds, private placements and GNMA/FNMA/FHLMC pools are valued using calculated yield curves created by models that incorporate various market factors. Primarily investments are held in U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds in diverse industries and are considered Level 2. Forward contracts included under government securities are traded in the over-the-counter market and occur between two parties only with no intermediary. The details of each contract such as trade size, price and maturity are tailored to each security and negotiated between the two parties, as such, these investments are considered Level 3. Other fixed income investments include zero coupon and interest rate swaps. 

Other

 – Other investments are comprised of an unallocated annuity contract, two limited liability companies and real estate. All are considered Level 3, as significant inputs to determine fair value are unobservable.

Commingled funds

 – The investment in the commingled funds are valued using the net asset value of units held as a practical expedient. The commingled funds consist of equity and fixed income portfolios with underlying investments held in U.S. and non-U.S. securities. 

The following tables present the fair values of our defined benefit pension plan’s assets, by level within the fair value hierarchy, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Commitments and Contingencies

In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited (“MEGPL”), a consolidated and wholly-owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements contain clauses that require MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC’s personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC’s automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant and certain environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. Pursuant to these agreements, MEGPL agreed to indemnify third party property or events, including environmental liabilities, injury to Alba Plant LLC’s personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC’s automobiles. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims or environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable.

The agreements to process the third-party Alen Unit gas required the execution of third-party guarantees by Marathon Oil Corporation in favor of the Alen Unit’s owners. Two separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of $

91

 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of $

25

 million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC.  Payment by us would be required if either of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was $

4

 million as of December 31, 2020, with a corresponding receivable from our investees. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A.’s performance.    

Various groups, including the State of North Dakota and three Indian tribes represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, we have a $

107

 million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, and have a long-term receivable of $

23

 million for capital and expenses.

In December 2019, we received a Notice of Violation from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality related to a release of produced water in North Dakota and a verbal notice of enforcement in January 2020 from the North Dakota Industrial Commission, related to a release of produced water in North Dakota. In January 2020, we received a Notice of Violation from the EPA related to the Clean Air Act. The enforcement actions will likely result in monetary sanctions and corrective actions yet-to-be specified; however, we do not believe this enforcement actions would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. 

We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain of these matters are discussed below.

Environmental matters

 – We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued liabilities for remediation were not material. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed.

Guarantees

 

– 

Over the years, we have sold various assets in the normal course of our business. Certain of the related agreements contain performance and general guarantees, including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and environmental and general indemnifications that require us to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. These guarantees and indemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We are typically not able to calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under such 

101

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

contractual provisions because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often, the nature of the guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the outcome can be based.

Contract commitments

 –

 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment totaled $

15

 million and $

41

 million. 

In connection with the sale of our operated producing properties in the greater Ewing Bank area and non-operated producing interests in the Petronius and Neptune fields in the Gulf of Mexico, we retained an overriding royalty interest in the properties. As part of the sale agreement, cumulative proceeds associated with the production of our override were $

57

 million as of December 31, 2020, and are dedicated solely to the satisfaction of the corresponding future abandonment obligations of the properties. The term of our override ends once sales proceeds equal $

70

 million.

Preparation of Reserve Estimates

All estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Crude oil and condensate, NGLs,  and natural gas reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group (“CRG”), which includes our Vice President of Corporate Reserves and his staff of Reserve Coordinators. Crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators (“QREs”). QREs are petro-technical professionals located throughout our organization who meet the qualifications we have established for employees engaged in estimating reserves and resources. QREs have the education, experience and training necessary to estimate reserves and resources in a manner consistent with all external reserve estimation regulations and internal resource estimation directives and practices. QREs generally hold at least a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of five years of industry experience with at least three years in reserve estimation and have completed our QRE training course. All reserves changes (including proved) must be approved by our Asset leadership and CRG. Additionally, any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the Vice President of Corporate Reserves.

The Vice President of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered Professional Engineer in Texas and Colorado. In his 22 years with Marathon Oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions related to the Company’s U.S. production operations in Oklahoma, Colorado and North Dakota, as well as international production operations in Aberdeen and Kurdistan. Prior positions include Vice President of petro-technical support teams (Technology Application) and Regional Vice President of the Bakken Asset. He is a 25 year member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”). 

Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves.

Audits of Estimates 

We have established a robust series of internal controls, policies and processes intended to ensure the quality and accuracy of our internal reserve estimates. We also engage third-party consultants to audit our estimates of proved reserves. Our policy requires that audits are provided that comprise at least 80% of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period, adjusted for dispositions. We have conducted our audits on a one-year in arrears basis and accordingly, our third-party consultants have not yet performed any audits of our reserve estimates for the year-ended December 31, 2020. In calculating our proved reserve audit coverage percentage, we only include the most recent year a field was audited within the rolling four-year period. To illustrate, our third-party proved reserve audit conducted during 2020 was for reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019 and covered reserves in Equatorial Guinea (169 mmboe). The reserve audits conducted during 2019 were for reserve estimates as of December 31, 2018 and included reserves in Eagle Ford (347 mmboe) and Oklahoma (255 mmboe), which is reflected net of 2019 production in calculating our audit coverage as of December 31, 2020. The reserve audits conducted during 2018 were for reserve estimates as of December 31, 2017 and included reserves in Bakken (283 mmboe), which is reflected net of 2018 and 2019 production in calculating our audit coverage as of December 31, 2020. On this basis, our third-party reserve audits covered 88% of our total proved reserves, excluding dispositions.  An audit tolerance at a field level of +/- 10% to our internal estimates has been established.  All audits conducted during this period fell within the established tolerance.

For the reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) prepared a reserves certification for the Alba field in E.G. The NSAI summary report is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Members of the NSAI team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. NSAI’s technical team members meet or exceed the education, training and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the SPE. The senior technical advisor has over 16 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering and the estimation and evaluation of reserves and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. The second team member has over 14 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and is a licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas.

104

Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)

Ryder Scott Company performed audits for reserve estimates of our fields as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 38 years of industry experience, having worked for a major financial advisory services group before joining Ryder Scott. He is a 25 year member of SPE and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.

Estimated

 

Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

The estimation of net recoverable quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas is a highly technical process which is based upon several underlying assumptions that are subject to change. Proved reserves are determined using “SEC Pricing”, calculated as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month closing price for each month. As discussed in 

Item 1A. Risk Factors

 and
