Key Events and Recent Developments

Several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations. They are listed below:

•

Coronavirus Pandemic

◦

In March 2020, infections of the coronavirus COVID-19 had become pandemic with persons testing positive in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. With the possibility of widespread infection in the United States and abroad, national, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. The Company has been classified as an essential business in certain jurisdictions that have decided that issue to date, and we have been allowed to remain open. However, we can give no assurance that that will not change in the future and we may also be forced to close stores or other facilities for other reasons such as the health of our associates or because of disruptions in the continued operation of our supply chain and sources of supply. Other economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are difficult to predict and may adversely impact our results of operations or business condition.

•

Integration of Family Dollar 

◦

In 2018, based on our strategic and operational reassessment of the Family Dollar segment following challenges that the business experienced that impacted our ability to grow the business at the originally estimated rate when we acquired Family Dollar in 2015, management determined there were indicators that the goodwill of the business may be impaired. Accordingly, a goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and we performed our annual impairment test in 2019. The results of the impairment tests showed that the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in $313.0 million and $2.73 billion non-cash pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment charges in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

◦

In March 2019, we announced plans for a store optimization program for Family Dollar. For fiscal 2019, this program included rolling out a new model for both new and renovated Family Dollar stores, internally known as H2, re-bannering selected stores to the Dollar Tree brand, closing under-performing stores, and installing adult beverages and expanding freezers and coolers in selected stores. We plan to continue to roll out the H2 concept to more stores, increase the number of stores with adult beverages and expand freezers and coolers in selected stores in 2020.

◦

In fiscal 2019, we substantially completed our consolidation of our store support centers in Matthews, North Carolina and Chesapeake, Virginia to our Summit Pointe development in Chesapeake, Virginia.

•

Supply Chain

◦

In the third quarter of 2018, we opened a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in Warrensburg, Missouri.

◦

In the third quarter of 2019, we opened a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in Morrow County, Ohio.

◦

In fiscal 2019, we began construction of a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in Rosenberg, Texas which is expected to be operational in the third quarter of 2020.

◦

In fiscal 2019, we announced plans to construct a new high velocity distribution center in Ocala, Florida that will provide service directly to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores throughout Florida and parts of the Southeast and will be built in two phases eventually comprising a 1.7 million square foot facility.

•

Long-term Debt

◦

During the first quarter of 2018, we redeemed our $750.0 million acquisition notes and accelerated the amortization of debt-issuance costs associated with the notes of $6.1 million.

◦

During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our long-term debt obligations as follows:

▪

We completed the registered offering of $750.0 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2020, $1.0 billion of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2023, $1.0 billion of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion of 4.20% Senior Notes due 2028;

▪

We entered into a credit agreement for a $782.0 million term loan facility and a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility;

▪

We used the proceeds of the above offerings to repay the $2,182.7 million outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities and redeem the remaining $2,500.0 million outstanding under our acquisition debt, resulting in the acceleration of the expensing of $41.2 million of deferred financing costs and the incurrence of $114.3 million in prepayment penalties. 

◦

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we prepaid the $782.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility and accelerated the expensing of $1.5 million of deferred financing costs.

◦

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we prepaid $500.0 million of the $750.0 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2020 and accelerated the expensing of $0.3 million of deferred financing costs.

Overview

We are a leading operator of more than 

15,200

 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. Our Dollar Tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. Our Family Dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.

Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. Second is the performance of stores once they are open. Sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. We include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term ‘expanded’ also includes stores that are relocated. Stores that have been re-bannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand.

At 

February 1, 2020

, we operated stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as stores in five Canadian provinces. A breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended 

February 1, 2020

Stores are included as re-banners when they close or open, respectively. Comparable store net sales for Dollar Tree may be negatively affected when a Family Dollar store is re-bannered near an existing Dollar Tree store. 

The average size of stores opened in 

2019

 was approximately 

8,600

 selling square feet (or about 

10,640

 gross square feet) for the Dollar Tree segment and 

7,770

 selling square feet (or about 

9,630

 gross square feet) for the Family Dollar segment. For 

2020

, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 

8,000

 - 

10,000

 selling square feet (or about 

10,000

 - 

12,000

 gross square feet) for the Dollar Tree segment and approximately 

7,000

 - 

9,000

 selling square feet (or about 

9,000

 - 

11,000

 gross square feet) for the Family Dollar segment. We believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits.

Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 which ended on February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, each included 52 weeks.

 

Fiscal 2017 ended on February 3, 2018 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. The 53rd week in 2017 added approximately $406.6 million in sales.

In fiscal 

2019

, comparable store net sales increased by 

1.8%

 on a constant currency basis, as a result of increases in average ticket and customer count. Constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current year’s comparable store net sales in Canada using the prior year’s currency exchange rates. We believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance. Including the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, comparable store net sales increased the same 

1.8%

. On a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 

2.3%

 in the Dollar Tree segment and increased 

1.4%

 in the Family Dollar segment in fiscal 

2019

. In the Dollar Tree segment, customer count increased 

1.3%

 and average ticket increased 

1.0%

. In the Family Dollar segment, an increase of 

1.8%

 in average ticket was partially offset by a decrease in customer count of 

0.4%

. Including the impact of currency, comparable store net sales in the Dollar Tree segment increased 

2.2%

. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.

Dollar Tree Initiatives

We believe comparable store net sales continue to be positively affected by a number of our Dollar Tree initiatives. We continued the roll-out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our Dollar Tree stores in 2019 and as of 

February 1, 2020

, the Dollar Tree banner had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 

6,155

 stores compared to approximately 

5,665

 stores at 

February 2, 2019

. In 2018, we rolled out a new layout to a number of our Dollar Tree stores, which we call our Snack Zone. This layout highlights our immediate consumption snack offerings in the front of the store near the checkout areas. As of 

February 1, 2020

, we have Snack Zone in more than 2,100 Dollar Tree stores and we plan to incorporate Snack Zone in 500 new and existing stores in fiscal 2020. We believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers. We expect to open approximately 350 Dollar Tree stores in fiscal 2020. 

Family Dollar Initiatives

As announced in March 2019, we executed a store optimization program in fiscal 2019 for our Family Dollar stores to improve performance. Included in that program was a roll-out of a new model for both new and renovated Family Dollar stores internally known as H2. We tested the H2 model in 2018 on a limited basis with positive results. This H2 model has significantly improved merchandise offerings, including approximately 20 Dollar Tree $1.00 merchandise sections and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors, throughout the store. H2 has increased traffic and provided an average comparable store net sales lift in excess of 10% in the first year following renovation. H2 performs well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where Family Dollar has been most challenged in the past. We began 2019 with approximately 200 H2 stores and as of 

February 1, 2020

, we have approximately 1,535 H2 stores. We plan to renovate approximately 1,250 stores to the H2 format in fiscal 2020. In addition, we installed adult beverage product in approximately 620 stores in 2019 and plan to add it to approximately 1,000 more stores in 2020. We believe the addition of adult beverage to our assortment will drive traffic to our stores. We expect to open approximately 200 Family Dollar stores in fiscal 2020, which are expected to be in the H2 format.

As a part of the fiscal 2019 store optimization program at Family Dollar, we closed 423 under performing stores and incurred approximately $42.5 million in store closure costs related to markdowns, labor and the disposal of fixed assets. In 2020, we plan to close approximately 100 stores at the end of their lease terms. We also re-bannered 200 Family Dollar stores to the Dollar Tree brand in 2019. 

As part of our continuing integration of Family Dollar’s organization and support functions, in 2019 we consolidated our store support centers in Matthews, North Carolina and Chesapeake, Virginia to our Summit Pointe development in Chesapeake, Virginia. Approximately 30 percent of the Matthews associates, including more than 50 percent of the officers and directors, invited 

28

Table of Contents

to move to Chesapeake agreed to do so. The consolidation was substantially completed in fiscal 2019 and we incurred pre-tax expense of approximately $28.2 million in 2019 in connection with the consolidation. 

Other Items

Additionally, the following items have already impacted or could impact our business or results of operations during 2020 or in the future:

•

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) previously imposed tariffs under Section 301 against Chinese goods described on Lists 1, 2, and 3 at a rate of 25%. On September 1, 2019, goods described on List 4A became subject to tariffs at the rate of 15%. On February 14, 2020, the tariff rate on List 4A goods declined to 7.5%.

•

During 2019 we were able to negotiate price concessions from vendors on certain products, cancel orders, change product sizes and specifications, change our product mix and change vendors in order to mitigate most of the potential adverse effects of the tariffs under Lists 1, 2 and 3 on the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments through January 2020. Due to the timing of the List 4A tariffs, we were not able to significantly mitigate these tariffs in 2019. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Section 301 tariffs increased our costs of goods sold by approximately $29.0 million. 

•

We believe that the annualization of these tariffs under Section 301 will increase cost of goods sold in 2020 by approximately $47.0 million as compared to 2019, with the majority of this increase affecting the first half of 2020.

•

We will continue to assess the future impact of these tariffs. We can give no assurances as to the final scope, duration, or impact of any existing or future tariffs. The tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in 2020.

•

We anticipate higher import freight costs continuing into 2020 based on our April 2019 rate negotiations and the commencement in January 2020 of low sulphur fuel requirements for ships. 

•

We also anticipate higher promotional activity in the first quarter of 2020 in the Family Dollar segment as we rebuild our discretionary assortment.

We must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results.

Net Sales.

 Net sales increased 3.5%, or $787.5 million, in 

2019

 compared to 

2018

, resulting from increases in comparable store net sales in the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments and sales of $796.3 million at new stores, partially offset by lost 

29

Table of Contents

sales resulting from store closures primarily on the Family Dollar segment. Comparable store net sales increased 

1.8%

 on a constant currency basis as a result of a 

1.2%

 increase in average ticket and a 

0.6%

 increase in customer count. Comparable store net sales increased the same 

1.8%

 when including the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 

2.3%

 in the Dollar Tree segment and increased 

1.4%

 in the Family Dollar segment. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.

Gross profit.

 Gross profit increased $93.2 million or 1.3%, to $7,040.7 million in 

2019

 compared to $6,947.5 million in 

2018

. Gross profit margin decreased to 29.8% in 

2019

 from 30.4% in 

2018

. Our gross profit margin decrease was due to the following:

•

Merchandise cost, including freight, increased approximately 25 basis points resulting from higher tariffs, higher freight costs, and higher sales of lower margin consumable merchandise, primarily in the Family Dollar segment, partially offset by improved initial mark-on.

•

Shrink costs increased approximately 15 basis points in 2019 due to unfavorable inventory results, primarily in the Family Dollar segment.

•

Distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points resulting primarily from higher distribution center payroll costs and higher depreciation.

•

Occupancy costs increased approximately 10 basis points resulting from higher real estate tax expense.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $5,778.5 million in 

2019

 from $7,887.0 million in 

2018

, a decrease of $2,108.5 million or 26.7%. We recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $313.0 million and $2,727.0 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The goodwill impairments are discussed further in 

Note 3

 to our consolidated financial statements. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $305.5 million or 5.9% in 2019 and increased to 23.2% from 22.6%, as a percentage of net sales. This increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was a result of the following:

•

Operating and corporate expenses increased approximately 40 basis points resulting from increased costs related to the consolidation of our store support centers, costs related to the disposal of fixed assets due to store closures in conjunction with the Family Dollar store optimization program, higher legal expenses and increased debit and credit fees resulting from higher penetration.

•

Payroll expenses increased approximately 15 basis points primarily due to average hourly rate increases and additional hours, including higher temporary help expenses, to support store-level initiatives. These increases were partially offset by decreased retirement plan contributions.

Operating income (loss)

.

 Operating income was $1,262.2 million in 

2019

 compared to an operating loss of $939.5 million  in 

2018

. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018, operating income decreased to $1,575.2 million in 

2019

 compared with $1,787.5 million in 

2018

 and operating income margin decreased to 6.7% in 

2019

 from 7.8% in 

2018

 due to the reasons noted above. 

Interest expense, net. 

Interest expense, net was $162.1 million in 

2019

 compared to $370.0 million in 

2018

. The prior year included prepayment premiums totaling $114.3 million and the acceleration of the expensing of $41.2 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs related to the debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, our 2018 debt refinancing resulted in lower interest rates and the prepayment of the $782.0 million Term Loan Facility in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulted in our having less debt outstanding.

Income taxes

.

 Our effective tax rate in 

2019

 was 

24.7%

 compared to 

21.5%

 in 

2018

. The increase in 2019 is a result of the effect of the goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 that are not tax deductible. The 2019 effective tax rate includes the benefit of the reversal of a valuation allowance of $24.6 million. The 2018 effective tax rate includes an additional benefit of $16.2 million related to the completion of our analysis of the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”).

Segment Information

We operate a chain of more than 

15,200

 retail discount stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces. Our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. 

We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment’s net sales, gross profit and operating income. The CODM reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments. We may revise the measurement of each segment’s 

30

Table of Contents

operating income, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the CODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation. In the current year, we identified Corporate and support costs, mainly store support center costs that are considered shared services, and excluded these selling, general and administrative costs from our two reporting business segments. These costs include operating expenses for our store support centers in Chesapeake, Virginia and Matthews, North Carolina. During fiscal 2019, we consolidated our Matthews, North Carolina store support center with our store support center in Chesapeake, Virginia. We continue to own our facility in Matthews, North Carolina. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to be comparable to the current year presentation.

Fiscal year ended 

February 1, 2020

 compared to fiscal year ended 

February 2, 2019

 

Net sales for the Dollar Tree segment increased 6.8%, or $795.8 million in 

2019

 compared to 

2018

 due to sales from new stores of $586.9 million and a comparable store net sales increase of 

2.3%

 on a constant currency basis resulting from increases in customer count and average ticket of 

1.3%

 and 

1.0%

, respectively. 

Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 34.7% in 

2019

 from 35.3% in 

2018

. The decrease is due to the following:

•

Merchandise cost, including freight, increased approximately 40 basis points primarily due to higher tariffs and higher freight costs, partially offset by improved initial mark-on.

•

Distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to higher distribution center payroll and depreciation costs.

Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 13.3% in 

2019

 compared to 14.1% in 

2018

. The decrease in operating income margin in 2019 was the result of lower gross profit margin as noted above and increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 21.4% in 2019 compared to 21.2% in 2018 as a result of the net of the following: 

•

Payroll expenses increased approximately 15 basis points due to higher store hourly payroll costs resulting from average hourly rate increases and additional hours to support store-level initiatives, partially offset by lower retirement plan expense.

•

Operating expenses increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to increased debit and credit fees resulting from higher debit and credit card penetration in the current year.

Fiscal year ended 

February 1, 2020

 compared to fiscal year ended 

February 2, 2019

 

Net sales for the Family Dollar segment decreased $8.3 million or 0.1% in 

2019

 compared to 

2018

 as a result of the store closures associated with the store optimization program. The lost sales were partially offset by a comparable store net sales increase of 

1.4%

 and $209.4 million of new stores sales. Average ticket increased 

1.8%

 and customer count decreased 

0.4%

 in 2019.

Gross profit for the Family Dollar segment decreased $112.2 million or 4.0% in 

2019

 compared to 

2018

. The gross profit margin for Family Dollar decreased to 24.3% in 

2019

 compared to 25.3% in 

2018

. The decrease is due to the following:

•

Merchandise cost, including freight, increased approximately 40 basis points, primarily due to higher sales of lower margin consumable merchandise and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher initial mark-on. 

•

Shrink costs increased approximately 30 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current year.

•

Distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points resulting primarily from higher merchandising and distribution payroll-related costs.

•

Occupancy costs increased approximately 15 basis points resulting primarily from higher real estate tax expense.

Operating loss margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased to 0.7% in 2019 from 20.9% in 2018. The operating losses in 2019 and 2018 were the result of $313.0 million and $2,727.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charges, respectively. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018, operating income margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased to 2.1% in 2019 from 3.7% in 2018, due to the gross profit margin decrease noted above and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales. Excluding the goodwill impairments in 2019 and 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 22.2% in 2019, compared to 21.6% in 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the net of the following:

•

Operating expenses increased approximately 45 basis points resulting primarily from higher costs related to the disposal of fixed assets in connection with the store optimization program, higher legal expenses, higher debit and credit fees resulting from higher debit and credit card penetration and higher store supplies expense to support the H2 initiative.

•

Payroll expenses increased approximately 15 basis points primarily due to average hourly rate increases and additional hours, including increased temporary help expenses, to support store-level initiatives, partially offset by lower insurance expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate and expand our existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities 

increased

 

$203.5 million

 in 

2019

 compared with 

2018

 primarily due to increased capital expenditures related to the Family Dollar segment store optimization program, including H2 renovations and re-banners, partially offset by grant money received from state and local governments for our Summit Pointe development.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities 

decreased

 

$890.1 million

 in 

2019

 compared to 

2018

 primarily due to our debt refinancing in 2018, which resulted in debt payments exceeding the proceeds of long-term debt by $656.9 million and the payment of $155.3 million of debt-issuance and extinguishment costs. We also prepaid the $782.0 million term loan facility in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, we prepaid $500.0 million of our $750.0 million Floating Rate Notes and paid $200.0 million for 2019 stock repurchases.

At 

February 1, 2020

, our long-term borrowings were 

$3.8 billion

 and we had $1.25 billion available under our revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling 

$136.9 million

. For additional detail on our long-term borrowings and other commitments, refer to the discussion of Funding Requirements below, as well as

Funding Requirements

Overview

We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding and renovating existing stores in fiscal 

2020

 to total approximately 

$575.9 million

, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.

Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 

2020

 are approximately $1.2 billion, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, approximately 1,250 planned H2 renovations of Family Dollar segment stores, the construction of two new distribution centers and the development of additional parcels on our Summit Pointe property, located in Chesapeake, Virginia, for mixed-use purposes. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Long-term Borrowings

In the first quarter of 2018, we redeemed our $750.0 million acquisition notes and accelerated the amortization of debt-issuance costs associated with the notes of $6.1 million.

Additionally, in the first quarter of 2018, we completed the registered offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2020, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2023, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% Senior Notes due 2028. We also entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for $2.03 billion in senior credit facilities, consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and a $782.0 million term loan facility. We used the proceeds of these borrowings and cash on hand to repay all of the outstanding loans under our then-existing senior secured credit facilities and acquisition notes, resulting in the acceleration of the expensing of $41.2 million of deferred financing costs and the incurrence of $114.3 million in prepayment penalties. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we prepaid in full the $782.0 million term loan facility and in the fourth quarter of 2019, we prepaid $500.0 million of the $750.0 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2020.

In addition, upon the acquisition of Family Dollar in 2015, we assumed the liability for $300.0 million of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2021.

The interest on our long-term borrowings represents the interest payments on the foregoing long-term borrowings that were outstanding at 

February 1, 2020

 using the interest rates for each at 

February 1, 2020

.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the policies that we consider critical.

Inventory Valuation

As discussed in 

Note 1

 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Merchandise Inventories,” inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.

Inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.

We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic 

34

Table of Contents

conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.

Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and October of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at February 1, 2020 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2019, including the fourth quarter. The amounts recorded in the current year reflect the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments’ historical results. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described.

Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value each year on a consistent basis.

Self-Insurance Liabilities

The liabilities related to our self-insurance programs for workers’ compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. Semiannually, we obtain third-party actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change.

Management’s estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events; however, historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. These assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.

For purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are Family Dollar, Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada. Goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. In the event a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we then estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. Under the market multiple approach, we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies’ market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and adjusted for a control premium. Under the discounted cash flow approach, we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions, adjusted for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows). If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

The Family Dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the Family Dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. Critical assumptions that are used as part of the Family Dollar goodwill evaluation include:

•

The potential future revenue, EBITDA and cash flows of the reporting unit. 

The projections use management’s assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue, gross margin, expenses and other factors. The resulting revenue, EBITDA and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans, and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. We believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2019 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.

•

Selection of an appropriate discount rate. 

Calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. Given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. We engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the 

35

Table of Contents

cash flows for our Family Dollar reporting unit. The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 8.25% for our fiscal 2019 analysis.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Family Dollar trade name, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. We estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. The discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount used for the Family Dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit. 

Our impairment evaluations of goodwill resulted in non-cash impairment charges of $313.0 million and $2.73 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the Family Dollar reporting unit. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2017. Our evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. Based on the result of the evaluation, the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name was within 1.5% of its carrying value.

For additional information on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the related impairment evaluations, refer to 

Note 3

 to our consolidated financial statements. For additional information on uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events and/or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions, please refer to “

Item 1A. Risk Factors

” and elsewhere within this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.
