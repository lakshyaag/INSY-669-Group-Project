Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s ("Leidos") financial condition, results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Unless indicated otherwise, references in this report to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer collectively to Leidos and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our intent, belief, or current expectations with respect to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations, backlog, initiatives, our industry and government budgets and spending. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors (see “Risk Factors—Forward-Looking Statement Risks” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in “Risk Factors" and "Business Environment and Trends.” Due to such uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to update these factors or to publicly announce the results of any changes to our forward-looking statements due to future events or developments.

Overview

We are 

a FORTUNE 500

®

 science, engineering and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. We bring domain-specific capability and innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities:

 

cyber; digital modernization; integrated systems; mission software systems; mission support; operations and logistics; and sensors, collection and phenomenology

.

 Our domestic customers include the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and many other U.S. government civilian agencies, as well as state and local government agencies. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in Australia and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). Less than 

10%

 of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities located outside of the United States. We operate in 

three

 reportable segments: Defense Solutions, Civil and Health. Additionally, we separately present the unallocable costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate.

Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on our reportable segments, prior year segment results have been recast to reflect this change.

For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see “Business” in Part I and "

Note 24—Business Segments

" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART II

Our significant initiatives include the following:

•

achieving internal, or non-acquisition related, annual revenue growth through internal collaboration and better leveraging of key differentiators across our company and the deployment of resources and investments into higher growth markets;

•

increasing headcount and internal direct labor content on our contract portfolio;

•

continued improvement in our back office infrastructure and related business processes for greater effectiveness and efficiency across all business functions; and

•

disciplined deployment of our cash resources and use of our capital structure to enhance shareholder value while retaining an appropriate amount of financial leverage.

Sales Trend. 

For fiscal 2019, revenues increased 

$900 million

, or 

9%

 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to

 

program wins and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by programs ended and the impact of the sale of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses. For fiscal 2018, revenues were 

$10.2 billion

, consistent with fiscal 2017. 

See "Results of Operations" below for discussion of our individual segment results.

Operating Expenses and Income Trend. 

For fiscal 2019, operating expenses increased by 

$737 million

, or 

8%

, compared to fiscal 2018. Operating margin for fiscal 2019 was 

8.2%

 compared to 

7.3%

 for fiscal 2018. Operating income was 

$912 million

, a 

$163 million

 increase compared to fiscal 2018. The increases in operating margin and operating income were primarily attributable to the receipt of the Greek arbitration award, favorable program mix, decreases in acquisition, integration and restructuring costs and lower amortization of intangible assets.

For fiscal 2018, operating expenses decreased by 

$161 million

, or 

2%

, compared to fiscal 2017. Operating margin for fiscal 2018 was 

7.3%

 compared to 

5.5%

 for fiscal 2017. Operating income was 

$749 million

 for fiscal 2018, a 

$190 million

 increase compared to fiscal 2017. These changes were primarily attributable to decreases in acquisition, integration and restructuring costs and lower amortization of intangible assets.

From a macroeconomic perspective, our industry is under general competitive pressures associated with spending from our largest customer, the U.S. government, and requires a high level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive. Although the current Administration has not indicated a desire to reduce spending in the defense and homeland security sectors, the likelihood, extent and duration of current spending levels in these areas remains unclear. We continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary.

Business Environment and Trends

U.S. Government Markets

In fiscal 

2019

, we generated approximately 

87%

 of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. Revenues under contracts with the DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community, including subcontracts under which the DoD or the U.S. Intelligence Community is the ultimate purchaser, represented approximately 

48%

 of our total revenues for fiscal 

2019

. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially national security, homeland security and intelligence spending, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government. 

From December 21, 2018 until the passage of a new continuing resolution ("CR") on January 25, 2019 there was a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments. Prior to the expiration of the January CR, Congress passed appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills, thereby completing funding for GFY 2019.

On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021. Allocations for national defense spending increased to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and $741 billion in GFY 2021. For non-defense programs, spending increased to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021. Overall, the measure increased spending by $323 billion over the limits set under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.

Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 

32

Table of Contents

PART II

On December 20, 2019, Congress passed and the President signed into law two consolidated appropriations bills, thereby funding the federal government through the end of GFY 2020.

On February 10, 2020, the President submitted the GFY 2021 budget proposal to Congress, which included discretionary spending levels for defense and non-defense programs of $741 billion and $590 billion, respectively.

Trends in the U.S. government contracting process, including a shift towards multiple-awards contracts, in which certain contractors are preapproved using indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity ("IDIQ") and U.S. General Services Administration ("GSA") contract vehicles, have increased competition for U.S. government contracts, reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts and increased pricing pressure. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, see “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

International Markets

Sales to customers in international markets represented 

8%

 of total revenues for fiscal 

2019

. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in Australia and the U.K. Our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks.

Recent changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials, may increase our procurement costs of certain IT hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use. However, we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our cost-plus contracts. While we are still evaluating the impact of higher tariffs, currently, we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business.

Key Performance Measures

The primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted earnings per share. Bookings and backlog are also useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues. In addition, we consider business performance by contract type to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating income and margin performance.

Effective the beginning of fiscal 2018, we established a new U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards structure and revised our disclosure statements accordingly to reflect the related cost accounting practice changes. Consequently, 

$185 million

 was reclassified from "Cost of revenues" to "Selling, general and administrative expenses" on the consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2017. For more information, see "

Corporate operating loss represents corporate costs that are not directly related to the operating performance of the reportable segments. 

The decrease in operating loss for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily attributable to the 

$52 million

 net gain recognized upon the receipt of the Greek arbitration award, lower acquisition, integration and restructuring costs of $32 million and an asset impairment charge of 

$7 million

 in the prior year.

The decrease in operating loss for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily attributable to lower acquisition, integration and restructuring costs of $102 million, partially offset by increased legal fees and an asset impairment charge of 

$7 million

.

Equity earnings of non-consolidated subsidiaries

We have certain non-controlling ownership interests in equity method investments. For fiscal 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, we recorded earnings of 

$29 million

,

 

$28 million

 and 

$27 million

, respectively, from our equity method investments, partially offset by amortization of 

$11 million

, 

$10 million

 and 

$14 million

, respectively.

Non-Operating Expense, Net

Non-operating expense, net decreased 

$93 million

 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the 

$88 million

 gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.

Non-operating expense, net decreased 

$27 million

 for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a 

$33 million

 promissory note impairment that occurred during fiscal 2017, partially offset by unfavorable fair value changes on investments held in our benefit plans.

Provision for Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 

22.6%

, 

4.6%

 and 

7.4%

 in fiscal 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted primarily by excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions and federal research tax credits, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances arising from foreign withholding tax and an increase in taxes related to the sale of the commercial cybersecurity business.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in valuation allowances arising from the taxable conversion of a subsidiary and the utilization of capital losses, an increase in deferred tax assets related to the stock basis of a subsidiary held for sale, excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions and federal research tax credits

.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted primarily by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% applied to our fiscal 2017 year-end deferred tax balances and excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based payment transactions, partially offset by the impact of certain capitalized transaction costs.

Non-controlling Interest

We have an 

88%

 controlling interest in Mission Support Alliance, LLC ("MSA"), a joint venture with Centerra Group, LLC, which includes 

41%

 purchased from Jacobs Group, LLC on January 26, 2018. We include the financial results for MSA in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was 

$3 million

 and 

$1 million

, respectively, compared to net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of 

$2 million

 for fiscal 2017.

Bookings and Backlog

We had net bookings of 

$14.5 billion

 and 

$13.7 billion

 during fiscal 

2019

 and 

2018

, respectively. Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year, net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts. We calculate net bookings as the year’s ending backlog, plus the year’s revenues, less the prior year’s ending backlog and any impacts from foreign currency or acquisitions and divestitures.

Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts. We segregate our backlog into two categories as follows:

•

Funded Backlog.

 Funded backlog for contracts with the U.S. government represents the value on contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Funded backlog for contracts with non-U.S. government entities and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on the contracts.

•

Negotiated Unfunded Backlog. 

Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles, with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded and separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future task orders is anticipated.

 within our Civil segment attributable to our held for sale commercial cybersecurity business (see "

Note 7—Divestitures

" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

Bookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards, renewals, modifications and cancellations, as well as foreign currency movements. Contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industry-wide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the U.S. government as discussed in “Business Environment and Trends” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. In addition, certain contracts with commercial or non-U.S. government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed.

Contract Types

Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract. For a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenues, see “Business—Contract Types” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented were as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview of Liquidity

As of 

January 3, 2020

, we had 

$668 million

 in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to 

$750 million

 in secured borrowing capacity, if required. During fiscal 

2019

 and 

2018

, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants. 

At 

January 3, 2020

 and 

December 28, 2018

, we had outstanding debt of 

$3.0 billion

 and 

$3.1 billion

, respectively. The notes outstanding as of 

January 3, 2020

, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of 

January 3, 2020

. During fiscal 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, we made 

$80 million

, 

$59 million

, and 

$209 million

 of principal payments, respectively, on our long-term debt. This activity included 

$69 million

, 

$46 million

 and 

$76 million

 of principal payments on our senior secured term loans during fiscal 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. In April 2018, we made a required debt prepayment of 

$10 million

 on our senior secured term loans. The prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in our credit agreements. In addition to the required quarterly payments, we prepaid 

$130 million

 on our senior secured term loans during fiscal 2017.

We paid dividends of 

$198 million

 

for fiscal 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

.

We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Stock repurchases of Leidos common stock may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreements. Whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price, corporate capital requirements, other market conditions and regulatory requirements. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we entered into ASR agreements with a financial institution, whereby we paid an aggregate of 

$400 million

 and 

$250 million

, respectively, and received approximately 

6 million

 and 

4 million

 shares, respectively, of Leidos outstanding shares (see "

Note 19—Earnings Per Share

" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The purchases were recorded to "Additional paid-in capital" in the consolidated balance sheets. All shares delivered were immediately retired. 

Additionally, during fiscal 2019 and 2018, we made open market repurchases of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 

$25 million

 and 

$167 million

, respectively. During fiscal 2017, there were no open market repurchases of our common stock.

For the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility. 

On January 17, 2020 (the "Closing Date"), we entered into a Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions, which provides for a senior unsecured term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of 

$1.9 billion

 (the "Term Loan Facility") and a 

$750 million

 senior unsecured revolving facility. We used the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and cash on hand on the Closing Date to repay in full all indebtedness, and terminate all commitments, under, and discharge and release all guarantees and liens existing in connection with the Credit Agreements entered into in August 2016. Additionally, on January 31, 2020, in connection with the acquisition of Dynetics, Inc. ("Dynetics"), we entered into a Bridge Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions, which provides for a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 

$1.25 billion

 (the "Bridge Facility"). We used the proceeds of the Bridge Facility and cash on hand to fund the purchase of Dynetics and repay in full all third party indebtedness of Dynetics, terminate all commitments thereunder and discharge and release all existing guarantees and liens. See "

Note 27—Subsequent Events

" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding these transactions.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased 

$224 million

 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, the timing of interest payments and $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased 

$242 million

 for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by 

$24 million

 of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business ("IS&GS Business").

Net cash provided by investing activities increased 

$179 million

 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to 

$178 million

 of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses, 

$96 million

 

of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and 

$81 million

 of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by 

$94 million

 of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX, higher purchases of property, equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes.

Net cash used in investing activities increased 

$43 million

 for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to 

$81 million

 of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by 

$40 million

 of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.

Net cash used in financing activities increased 

$2 million

 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by 

$23 million

 of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock.

Net cash used in financing activities increased 

$278 million

 for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to 

$250 million

 of stock repurchases under the ASR program, 

$167 million

 of open market stock repurchases and 

$23 million

 of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability. This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and 

$14 million

 of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business. We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in "

Note 26—Commitments

" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These arrangements have not had, and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have, a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, operations or financial condition.

Other long-term liabilities were allocated by fiscal year as follows: liabilities under deferred compensation arrangements are based upon the average annual payments in prior years upon termination of employment by participants and other liabilities are based on the fiscal year that the liabilities are expected to be realized. The table above does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 

$1 million

 and 

$4 million

 of other tax liabilities, as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of audit outcomes and when settlements will become due. There is no obligation included for our foreign defined benefit pension plan, as the plan is overfunded as of 

January 3, 2020

. For a discussion of potential changes in these pension obligations, see "

Note 22—Retirement Plans

" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Commitments and Contingencies

We are subject to a number of reviews, investigations, claims, lawsuits, other uncertainties and future obligations related to our business. For a discussion of these items, see "

" and "

Note 26—Commitments

" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

PART II

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including 

cyber; digital modernization; integrated systems; mission software systems; mission support; operations and logistics; and sensors, collection and phenomenology

, primarily with the U.S. government and its agencies. We also serve various state and local governments, foreign governments and U.S. commercial customers. 

We perform under various types of contracts, which include firm-fixed-price ("FFP"), time-and-materials ("T&M"), fixed-price-level-of-effort ("FP-LOE"), cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive-fee contracts.

To determine the proper revenue recognition, we first evaluate whether we have a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer, in which the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified, and collectability is probable. We also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, including the task orders issued under an IDIQ award. In addition, we assess contract modifications to determine whether changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. Contract modifications for us generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services, and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract. If contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by an amount that reflects the standalone selling price, those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts.

Most of our contracts are comprised of multiple promises including the design and build of software-based systems, integration of hardware and software solutions, running and maintaining of IT infrastructure and procurement services. In all cases, we assess if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation. We generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract. If multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or require significant integration or customization within a group, they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.

Our contracts with the U.S. government often contain options to renew existing contracts for an additional period of time (generally a year at a time) under the same terms and conditions as the original contract, and generally do not provide the customer any material rights under the contract. We account for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices.

Contracts with the U.S. government are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") and priced on estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services. The FAR provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the U.S. government and its agencies. Each contract is competitively priced and bid separately. Pricing for non-U.S. government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer. In circumstances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price using the expected cost-plus margin approach. We exclude any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price.

Certain of our cost-plus and fixed-price contracts contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that we expect to be entitled to, based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria, complexity of work and related risks, extent of customer discretion, amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue.

We allocate the transaction price of a contract to its performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price of our performance obligations is generally based on an expected cost-plus margin approach, in accordance with the FAR. For certain product sales, we use prices from other standalone sales. Substantially all of our contracts do not contain a significant financing component, which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract.

PART II

We recognize revenue on our service based contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services. For U.S. government contracts, continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work-in-process as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternate use to us. Anticipated losses on service based contracts are recognized when known. In certain product sales, where the products have an alternate use, we recognize revenue at a point in time when the customer takes control of the asset usually denoted by possession and legal title.

On FFP contracts requiring system integration and cost-plus contracts with variable consideration, revenue is recognized over time generally using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation, principally using a cost-input method (referred to as the cost-to-cost method). Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costs-at-completion ("EAC"). A performance obligation's EAC includes all direct costs such as materials, labor, subcontract costs, overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs. In addition, we include in an EAC of a performance obligation future losses estimated to be incurred on onerous contracts, as and when known. On certain other contracts, principally T&M, FP-LOE and cost-plus-fixed-fee, revenue is recognized using the right-to-invoice practical expedient as we are contractually able to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer. Additionally, on maintenance (generally FFP) performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time using a straight-line method as the control of the services is provided to the customer evenly over the period of performance. 

For certain performance obligations where we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer, do not have inventory risk and do not have discretion in establishing the price for the goods or service, we recognize revenue on a net basis.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment 

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets, net collectively represent 58% and 63% of our total assets as of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. During fiscal 

2019

 and 

2018

, we had 

six

 and 

five

 reporting units, respectively, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment.

Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and intangibles requires the exercise of significant judgment and assumptions including judgments about expected future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, discount rates and expected long-term growth rates. A significant change to these estimates and assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units and intangible assets to decline and increase the risk of an impairment charge to earnings. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report -

PART II

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with the accounting standard for income taxes. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Under this method, changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted. 

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.

The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. 

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 

50%

 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our income tax expense.
