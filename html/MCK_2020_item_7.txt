Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

GENERAL 

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, referred to as the “Financial Review,” is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of McKesson Corporation together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” and other similar pronouns). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean our fiscal year.

Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Overview of Our Business:

We are a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare technology. We partner with life sciences companies, manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments and other healthcare organizations to help provide the right medicines

, 

medical products and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely and cost-effectively. 

We conduct our business through three reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure are included in Other, which primarily consists of McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions (“MRxTS”) and our investment in Change Healthcare LLC (“Change Healthcare JV”), which was split-off from the Company in the fourth quarter of 2020 as further discussed in this Financial Review. Our organizational structure also includes Corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects, and the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit before interest expense and income taxes. Refer to Financial 

Note 24

, “

Segments of Business

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Executive Summary:

The following executive summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business, operating results and liquidity for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

. The coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) did not significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in 2020. For a more in-depth discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our business, operations, and outlook, see the COVID-19 section of "Trends and Uncertainties" included below.

•

Revenues of 

$231.1 billion

, reflecting an 

8%

 increase from the prior year driven primarily by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, including branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher volumes from retail national account customers;

•

Gross profit increased 

2%

 from the prior year primarily driven by market growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment;

•

On October 21, 2019, we disclosed an opioid-related litigation settlement with two Ohio counties and recorded a related charge of 

$82 million

 in total operating expenses;

•

On December 12, 2019, McKesson and Walgreens Boots Alliance announced an agreement to create a joint venture that is expected to combine their respective pharmaceutical wholesale businesses in Germany. As a result of this agreement, we recognized fair value remeasurement charges of 

$275 million

 in total operating expenses within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment;

•

On March 10, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our investment in Change Healthcare JV and recognized an estimated gain of 

$414 million

 related to this transaction. We no longer hold an interest in any securities of Change Healthcare JV or Change Healthcare, Inc. (“Change”) following the separation. During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary-impairment (“OTTI”) charge of 

$1.2 billion

 and a dilution loss of 

$246 million

 related to our investment in Change Healthcare JV;

•

Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation in 2020 of 

$4.99

 reflects the aforementioned items and a lower share count compared to the prior year driven largely by share repurchases; and

•

We returned 

$2.2 billion

 of cash to shareholders through $1.9 billion of common stock repurchases and 

$294 million

 of dividend payments. 

Trends and Uncertainties:

COVID-19

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.

We continue to evaluate the nature and extent COVID-19 may have to our business and operations. The pandemic is developing rapidly and the full extent to which COVID-19 will impact us depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, as well as potential seasonality of new outbreaks.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local government directives and policies have been put in place in the United States to enhance availability of medications and supplies to meet the increased demand, assist front-line healthcare providers, manage public health concerns by creating social distancing, and address the economic impacts, including sharply reduced business activity, increased unemployment, and overall uncertainty presented by this new healthcare challenge. Similar governmental actions have occurred in Canada and Europe. 

As a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information technology, we are uniquely positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Canada, and Europe. We are working closely with national and local governments, agencies, and industry partners to ensure supplies, including personal protective equipment, and medicine reach our customers and patients when they need them.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that we continue to supply our customers and protect the safety of our employees. The various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations, including telecommuting and work-from-home policies, restricted travel requirements, employee support programs, and enhanced safety measures are intended to limit exposure to COVID-19. These successful steps in our fourth quarter of 2020 have resulted in limited disruption of our normal business operations, productivity trends, and slightly compressed operating margins due to increased operating expenses.

The financial impact to the year ended 

March 31, 2020

 is muted due to the timing of the COVID-19 pandemic late in our fourth quarter. We experienced higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in March, however, these increases were partially offset by decreases in specialty drug volumes and decreased demand within primary care medical-surgical supplies. Specialty drug volumes were negatively impacted by lower demand for infusions, elective specialty drugs, oncology, and dermatology practice sales. Demand for primary care medical-surgical supplies were negatively impacted by deferrals in elective procedures in hospitals and surgery centers as well as decreased traffic or closures in doctor’s offices. These positive and negative COVID-19 impacts drove increased consolidated revenues by less than 1% in 2020.

The increased volumes and revenue due to COVID-19 favorably impacted income from continuing operations before income taxes, but were mostly offset by increased variable labor costs, enhanced sterilization procedures to sanitize operating facilities, costs of personal protection equipment for our employees, and increased costs of transport as well as increased other operating expenses. Additionally, as previously mentioned, decreased specialty drug volumes and demand challenges for primary care medical-surgical supplies weighed negatively on income from continuing operations before income taxes. We also expanded temporary employee benefits and incentives targeted for our front-line employees to not only protect their safety, but to provide further support including additional medical benefits, emergency leave as well as added compensation. The overall impact to income from continuing operations before income taxes from the favorable and unfavorable items mentioned above largely offset each other, however, impacts to future periods due to COVID-19 may differ based on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus as well as potential seasonality of new outbreaks. Overall operating margins were compressed due to higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes, shifts in product mix, higher demand by retail national accounts and increased operating expenses. 

Our consolidated balance sheets and ability to maintain financial liquidity remains strong. We have experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital. With many of our customers anticipating extended declines in their businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring closely for trends that may impact their timing or ability to pay amounts owed to us. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, have remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are signs of stress in both markets, we do not have an immediate need to access these markets and could use our revolving credit facility to meet any near-term liquidity needs. We have seen some improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the Federal Reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets. We believe we have the ability to meet the covenants of our credit agreements.

We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic impact on our supply chain. We were able to maintain appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels under the circumstances in the fourth quarter, despite challenges including higher sickness rates and service level issues with suppliers. Supplier shortages and stock-outs for certain products have occurred in specific instances as demand in excess of supply escalated for certain items tied to the COVID-19 pandemic response, such as personal protective equipment and other preventive products. Our inventory levels have fluctuated in response to these supply dynamics and increased concentrated customer orders for certain products, with varying inventory level impacts depending on the specific product within our portfolio of offerings. 

Although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers, their location and the extent to which they are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proactively working with manufacturers, industry partners, and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers during the pandemic. We have assembled a Critical Care Drug Task Force, made up of our procurement specialists, clinical health systems pharmacists, and supply chain professionals, focused on securing additional product where available, sourcing back-up products, adjusting allocations to ensure equitable distribution and to protect our operations across all locations and facilities. We have a robust Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Program (“BCRP”) and we have proactively enhanced our BCRP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations and financial results beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although the financial impact on our overall 2020 results is limited due to the timing of the outbreak, we face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects on our future business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Additionally, responses from authorities and regulators at all levels of government may materially impact us in future periods. Due to several rapidly changing variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a disclosure of risk factors related to COVID-19.

Opioid-Related Litigation and Claims 

We are a defendant in over 3,000 legal proceedings asserting claims related to distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the United States, and in Puerto Rico and Canada. We are vigorously defending ourselves against such claims and proceedings and are a party to discussions with the objective of achieving broad resolution of the remaining claims. Because of the large number of parties involved, together with the novelty and complexity of the issues, for which there may be different considerations among the parties, we cannot predict the successful resolution through a negotiated settlement. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Revenues

 

Revenues increased for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

 and 

2019

 compared to the respective prior years primarily due to market growth, including expanded business with existing customers within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion. The increase in revenues for 

2019

 was also due to our 2019 first quarter acquisition of Medical Specialties Distributors LLC (“MSD”), partially offset by loss of customers within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. The impact from COVID-19 increased revenues by less than 1% for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

 and was primarily attributable to our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions and European Pharmaceutical Solutions segments.

Gross Profit

 

Gross profit increased for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

 compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Gross profit and gross profit margin for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

 compared to the prior year were unfavorably impacted by a decrease in net cash proceeds received of 

$22 million

 in 2020 compared to 

$202 million

 in 2019 representing our share of antitrust legal settlements, partially offset by higher last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) credits in 2020 due to higher generic deflation. The impact from COVID-19 increased gross profit by less than 1% and decreased gross profit margin by less than 10 basis points for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

.

Gross profit and gross profit margin increased for the year ended 

March 31, 2019

 compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased due to market growth, partially offset by loss of customers. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin for 2019 was also due to the receipt of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements of 

$202 million

, higher LIFO credits and our business acquisitions. These increases in 2019 were partially offset by the incremental government reimbursement reductions in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), government imposed generic price cuts in Canada and the 2018 third quarter sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) business.

Gross profit for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

Table of Contents

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Total operating expenses for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

 were affected by the following significant items:

2020

•

Selling, distribution and administrative expenses

 (“SD&A”) includes charges of 

$275 million

 to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell related to the expected contribution of the majority of our German wholesale business to create a joint venture in which McKesson will have a non-controlling interest within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Refer to Financial 

Note 3

, “

Held for Sale

,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information; 

•

SD&A includes opioid-related expenses of 

$232 million

, primarily litigation and related expenses, including the second quarter settlement charge of 

$82 million

 recorded in connection with an agreement executed in December 2019 to settle all opioid-related claims filed by two Ohio counties;

•

Restructuring, impairment and related charges

 includes long-lived asset impairment charges of 

$112 million

, primarily for our U.K. business (mainly pharmacy licenses) and Rexall Health retail business (“Rexall Health”) in Other (mainly customer relationships), and the remaining 

$156 million

 primarily represents employee severance and exit-related costs related to our 2019 restructuring initiatives, as further discussed below; and

•

Total operating expenses includes higher SD&A due to our business acquisitions and to support business growth, as well as our technology initiatives, partially offset by favorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.

2019

•

Goodwill impairment charges

 of 

$1.8 billion

 in our Retail Pharmacy (“RP”, formerly “Consumer Solutions”) and Pharmaceutical Distribution (“PD”, formerly “Pharmacy Solutions”) reporting units within the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Of these impairment charges, 

$238 million

 was recognized upon the 2019 first quarter segment changes, which resulted in two new reporting units. The remaining charges primarily were due to declines in the reporting units’ estimated future cash flows and the selection of higher discount rates. These impairment charges generally were not deductible for income tax purposes. The declines in estimated future cash flows primarily were attributed to additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures within the U.K. The risk of successfully achieving certain business initiatives was the primary factor in the use of a higher discount rate. At March 31, 2019, both RP and PD reporting units had no remaining goodwill balances;

•

Restructuring, impairment and related charges

 primarily includes employee severance and exit-related costs of 

$331 million

 for our 2019 restructuring initiatives, as further discussed below and long-lived asset impairment charges of 

$245 million

 primarily for our U.K. business (mainly pharmacy licenses) driven by additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the U.K.; and

•

SD&A includes opioid-related costs of 

$151 million

 primarily related to litigation expenses and increased expenses due to our business acquisitions and to support growth, partially offset by a gain from an escrow settlement of 

$97 million

 representing certain indemnity and other claims related to our 2017 acquisition of Rexall Health and a credit of 

$90 million

 for the derecognition of a liability related to the tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) payable to the shareholders of Change. 

2018

•

Goodwill impairment charges

 of 

$1.3 billion

 for the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and 

$455 million

 for Rexall Health. There were no tax benefits associated with these goodwill impairment charges. The impairments for Europe were triggered primarily by government reimbursement reductions in our retail business in the U.K. and a more competitive environment in France. The impairments for  Rexall Health were primarily driven by significant generics reimbursement reductions across Canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces. At March 31, 2018, Rexall Health had no remaining goodwill related to our acquisition of Rexall Health;

30

Table of Contents

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

•

Restructuring, impairment and related charges

 primarily includes long-lived asset impairment charges of 

$446 million

 due to the declines in estimated future cash flows in our European business including those declines in our U.K. retail business driven by government reimbursement reductions. In addition, we recorded employee severance and lease exit costs of 

$74 million

 for our 2018 restructuring plan in our McKesson Europe business. The plan was substantially completed in 2020;

•

SD&A includes a charitable contribution expense of 

$100 million

 to a public benefit California foundation (the “Foundation”);

•

SD&A includes increased expenses due to our business acquisitions, partially offset by a gain from sale of business of 

$109 million

 related to the sale of our EIS business within Other.

Goodwill Impairments

The impairment testing performed in 

2020

 did not indicate any material impairment of goodwill. As of the testing date, other risks, expenses and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods, including our McKesson Canada reporting unit in Other where the risk of a material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in this Financial Review for further information.

On October 1, 2019, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge. Refer to 

Note 14

, “

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

2019 Restructuring Initiatives

On April 25, 2018, we announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive long-term incremental profit growth and increase operational efficiency. The initiative consists of multiple growth priorities and plans to optimize our operating models and cost structures primarily through the centralization, cost management and outsourcing of certain administrative functions. As part of the growth initiative, we committed to implement certain actions including a reduction in workforce, facility consolidation and store closures. This set of the initiatives was substantially complete by the end of 2020 and we recorded charges of 

$15 million

 and 

$135 million

 in 

2020

 and 

2019

 primarily representing employee severance, exit-related costs and asset impairment charges. Any remaining charges primarily consist of exit-related costs. 

As previously announced on November 30, 2018, we relocated our corporate headquarters from San Francisco, California to Irving, Texas to improve efficiency, collaboration and cost competitiveness, effective April 1, 2019. We anticipate that the relocation will be complete by January 2021. We expect to incur total charges of approximately 

$80 million

 to 

$130 million

, of which charges of 

$44 million

 and 

$33 million

 were recorded in 

2020

 and 

2019

 primarily representing employee retention expenses, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation. The estimated remaining charges primarily consist of lease and other exit-related costs, and employee-related expenses including retention.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to additional programs to continue our operating model and cost optimization efforts. We continue to implement centralization of certain functions and outsourcing through the expanded arrangement with a third-party vendor to achieve operational efficiency. The programs also include reorganization and consolidation of our business operations and related headcount reductions, closures of retail pharmacy stores in Europe and closures of other facilities. We anticipate these additional programs will be substantially complete by the end of 2021. We expect to incur total charges of approximately 

$300 million

 to 

$350 million

 for these programs, of which charges of 

$72 million

 and 

$163 million

 were recorded in 

2020

 and 

2019

 primarily representing employee severance, accelerated depreciation expense and project consulting fees. The estimated remaining charges primarily consist of facility and other exit costs and employee-related costs.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Other Income, Net

 

Other income, net, for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the 2020 pension settlement charges of 

$122 million

 

related to our previously approved termination of the frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan and higher gains recognized from the sale of investments in 2019, partially offset by higher settlement gains in 2020 from our derivative contracts. In connection with the pension plan termination, we purchased annuity contracts from an insurer that will pay and administer the future pension benefits of the remaining participants.

Other income, net for the year ended 

March 31, 2019

 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains recognized from the sales of investments.

Equity Earnings and Charges from Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture

 

Our investment in Change Healthcare JV is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Excluding the impairment and transaction-related items described below, our proportionate share of loss from our investment in Change Healthcare JV for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

 was 

$119 million

, 

$194 million

 and 

$248 million

, which primarily includes transaction and integration expenses incurred by the joint venture and basis differences between the joint venture and McKesson including amortization of fair value adjustments. 2018 also includes certain transaction expenses, partially offset by a tax benefit of 

$76 million

 primarily due to a reduction in the future applicable tax rate related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). During the first quarter of 2020 and for the years ended 

March 31, 2019

 and 

2018

, we owned approximately 70% of this joint venture. 

On June 27, 2019, common stock and certain other securities of Change began trading on the NASDAQ (“IPO”). On July 1, 2019, upon the completion of its IPO, Change contributed net cash proceeds it received from its offering of common stock to Change Healthcare JV in exchange for additional membership interests of Change Healthcare JV (“LLC Units”) at the equivalent of its offering price of $13 per share. The proceeds from the concurrent offering of other securities were also used by Change to acquire certain securities of Change Healthcare JV. As a result, McKesson’s equity interest in Change Healthcare JV was reduced to approximately 

58.5%

, which was used to recognize our proportionate share in net loss from Change Healthcare JV, commencing the second quarter of 2020. As a result of the ownership dilution to 

58.5%

 from 

70%

, we recognized a dilution loss of approximately 

$246 million

 in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, our proportionate share of income or loss from this investment was subsequently reduced as immaterial settlements of stock option exercises occurred after the IPO and further diluted our ownership.

In the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an OTTI charge of 

$1.2 billion

 to our investment in Change Healthcare JV, representing the difference between the carrying value of our investment and the fair value derived from the corresponding closing price of Change’s common stock at September 30, 2019. This charge was included within equity earnings and charges from investment in Change Healthcare joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

. 

On March 10, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our interest in Change Healthcare JV. The separation was effected through the split-off of SpinCo, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that held all of our interest in Change Healthcare JV, to certain of our stockholders through an exchange offer (“Split-off”), followed by the merger of SpinCo with and into Change, with Change surviving the merger (“Merger”). 

In connection with the exchange offer, on March 9, 2020, we distributed all 

176.0 million

 outstanding shares of common stock of SpinCo to participating holders of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 

15.4 million

 shares of McKesson common stock. Following consummation of the exchange offer, on March 10, 2020, the Merger was consummated, with each share of SpinCo common stock converted into one share of Change common stock, par value 

$0.001

 per share, with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of Change common stock. The Split-off and Merger are intended to be generally tax-free transactions to McKesson and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Following the Split-off, we do not beneficially own any of Change’s outstanding securities. In connection with this transaction, we recognized an estimated gain for financial reporting purposes of 

$414 million

 during the fourth quarter of 2020, which was largely driven by the reversal of a related deferred tax liability.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

After the separation, Change Healthcare JV is required under the TRA to pay McKesson 85% of the net cash tax savings realized, or deemed to be realized, resulting from depreciation or amortization allocated to Change by McKesson. The receipt of any payments under the TRA is dependent upon Change benefiting from this depreciation or amortization in future tax return filings, which creates uncertainty over the amount, timing and probability of the gain recognized. As such, we account for the TRA as a gain contingency, with no receivable recognized as of March 31, 2020. 

Loss on Debt Extinguishment

 

In 2018, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 

$122 million

 primarily representing premiums related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding long-term debt.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the issuance of commercial paper, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from our derivative contracts. Interest expense decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the issuance of commercial paper. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit

 

We recorded income tax expense of 

$18 million

 and 

$356 million

 and tax benefit of 

$53 million

 related to continuing operations for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

. Our reported income tax expense rates were 

1.6%

 and 

58.4%

 in 

2020

 and 

2019

, and our income tax benefit rate was 

22.2%

 in 

2018

. 

Our reported income tax expense rate for 2020 was favorably impacted by an estimated gain on the Change Healthcare JV divestiture of 

$414 million

 (pre-tax and after-tax), which was intended to generally be a tax-free split-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and unfavorably impacted by charges of 

$275 million

 (pre-tax and after-tax) to remeasure the carrying value of assets and liabilities held for sale related to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint venture within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Refer to Financial 

Note 2

,“

Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture

” and 

Note 3

,“

Held for Sale

,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for more information. 

Our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by charges of 

$1.8 billion

 (pre-tax and after-tax) to impair the carrying value of goodwill for our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes. The reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was unfavorably impacted by the goodwill impairment charges of 

$1.7 billion

 (pre-tax and after-tax), given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes. Refer to Financial 

Note 14

, “

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. As a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the 2018 income tax benefit rate included a tax benefit of 

$1.3 billion

 from the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate, partially offset by a tax expense of 

$457 million

 representing the one-time tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries. 

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada and the U.K., we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

 

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, was a loss of 

$6 million

 for the year ended 

March 31, 2020

 and income of 

$1 million

 and 

$5 million

 for the years ended 

March 31, 2019

 and 

2018

.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC and the accrual of the annual recurring compensation amount of 

€0.83

 per McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) share that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”). Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial 

Note 9

, “

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests

Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation

 

Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was 

$900 million

, 

$34 million

 and 

$67 million

 for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation was 

$4.95

, 

$0.17

 and 

$0.32

 for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

. Additionally, our 

2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

 diluted earnings per share reflect the cumulative effects of share repurchases. 

Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares

 

Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 

182 million

, 

197 million

 and 

209 million

 for the years ended 

March 31, 2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is impacted by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and the cumulative effect of share repurchases, including the impact of shares exchanged as part of the split-off from our investment in Change Healthcare JV, as discussed above.

Foreign Operations

Our foreign operations represented approximately 

17%

 of our consolidated revenues in 

2020

 and approximately 

18%

 in each of 

2019

 and 

2018

. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency effect”, which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In computing foreign currency effect, we translate our current year results in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial

Fiscal 

2021

 Outlook

Information regarding the Company’s fiscal 

2021

 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 20, 2020. That Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in Item 7 - Trends and Uncertainties, and the cautionary statements in Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial 

Note 1

, “

Significant Accounting Policies

,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: 

We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.

In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. 

Sales to the Company’s 

ten

 largest customers, including GPOs, accounted for approximately 

51%

 of total consolidated revenues in 

2020

 and comprised approximately 

37%

 of total trade accounts receivable at 

March 31, 2020

. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 

20%

 of our total consolidated revenues in 

2020

 and comprised approximately 

20%

 of total trade accounts receivable 

March 31, 2020

. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 

Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. With many of our customers anticipating extended declines in their businesses due to COVID-19, we are monitoring closely for trends that may impact their timing or ability to pay amounts owed to us. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 

2020

 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed, as well as assessment of trends currently available.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Inventories:

 Inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. Prior to 2018, we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Effective in the first quarter of 2018, we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the last-in, last-out (“LIFO”) method which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under LIFO approximates market. The majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and weighted average purchase prices. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. 

At March 31, 

2020

 and 

2019

, total inventories, net were 

$16.7 billion

 on our consolidated balance sheets. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 

60%

 and 

62%

 of our inventories at March 31, 

2020

 and 

2019

. If we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately 

$444 million

 and 

$696 million

 higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 

2020

 and 

2019

. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We recognized LIFO credits of 

$252 million

, 

$210 million

 and 

$99 million

 in 

2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

 in our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. 

We believe that moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of 

March 31, 2020

 and 

2019

, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. 

In determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. 

Business Combinations: 

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that the Company obtains control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.

Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a method that is a form or variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life. Refer to Financial 

Note 5

, “

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures

,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. 

Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets: 

As a result of acquiring businesses, we have 

$9.4 billion

 of goodwill at March 31, 

2020

 and 

2019

, and 

$3.2 billion

 and 

$3.7 billion

 of intangible assets, net at March 31, 

2020

 and 

2019

. On October 1, 2019, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge. Refer to 

Note 14

, “

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.

In 2018, we elected to early adopt, on a prospective basis, the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test. The one-step impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, if any, up to the amount of goodwill the entity has recorded. 

To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.

Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Under the market approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit. Under the income approach, significant estimates and assumptions also includes the determination of discount rates. The discount rates represent the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing, which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure. Included in the estimate of the weighted average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections. An increase in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate.

Based on the 2019 annual goodwill impairment tests, the estimated fair values of our reporting units excluding the Retail Pharmacy (formerly, Consumer Solutions) and Pharmaceutical Distribution (formerly, Pharmacy Solutions) reporting units in our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment exceeded their carrying values. However, other risks, expenses and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods. The estimated fair value of our McKesson Canada reporting unit within Other exceeded the carrying value of this reporting unit by 

11%

 in 2020. The goodwill balance of this reporting unit was 

$1.4 billion

 at 

March 31, 2020

 or approximately 

15%

 of the consolidated goodwill balance. Generally, a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of 

12%

 or an increase in the discount rate in excess of 

1%

 could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods. Refer to Financial 

Note 14

, “

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Currently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 

38

 years. We review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial 

Note 4

, “

Restructuring, Impairment and Related Charges

” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Equity Method Investments:

 We evaluate our investments for other-than-temporary impairments when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost; the financial condition of the investees, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value. Management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to: identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary, expectations about the business operations of investees, as well as industry, financial and market factors. Any significant changes in assumptions or judgments in assessing impairments could result in an impairment charge.

Restructuring Charges: 

We have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exit-related costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred. In connection with these restructuring actions, we also assess the recoverability of long-lived assets used in the business, and as a result, we may recognize accelerated depreciation reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets.

Income Taxes: 

Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties and include those used to conclude on the tax-free nature of the separation of the Change Healthcare JV. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.

Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. 

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.

We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Loss Contingencies: 

We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.

We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. In conjunction with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements, we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party. While we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, consolidated financial position, cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Financial 

Note 21

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. As described within “Trends and Uncertainties” above, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly. We continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business, as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility. Additionally, long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, have remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are signs of stress in both markets, we do not have an immediate need to access these markets and could use our revolving credit facility to meet any near-term liquidity needs. We have seen some improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the Federal Reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets. We believe we have the ability to meet the covenants of our credit agreements.

Share Repurchase Plans

The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, ASR programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.

In 2018, we repurchased 3.5 million of our shares through open market transactions and 6.7 million of our shares through ASR programs. We received an additional 1.0 million shares in the first quarter of 2019 under the March 2018 ASR program. In 2019, we repurchased 10.4 million of our shares through open market transactions and 2.1 million of our shares through the December 2018 ASR program.

In 2019, we retired 5.0 million or $542 million of the Company’s treasury shares previously repurchased. Under the applicable state law, these shares resume the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. In accordance with our accounting policy, we allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Accordingly, our retained earnings and additional paid-in capital were reduced by $472 million and $70 million during 2019.

In 2020, we repurchased 

9.2 million

 of the Company’s shares for 

$1.3 billion

 through open market transactions at an average price per share of 

$144.68

. We also entered into an ASR program with a third-party financial institution to repurchase 

$600 million

 of the Company’s common stock. The total number of shares repurchased under this ASR program was 

4.7 million

 shares at an average price per share of 

$127.68

.

On March 9, 2020, we completed the Split-off of our interest in the Change Healthcare JV. In connection with the Split-off, we distributed all 

176.0 million

 outstanding shares of SpinCo common stock, which held all of the Company’s interests in the Change Healthcare JV, to participating holders of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 

15.4 million

 shares of McKesson stock, which are now held as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheet. Following consummation of the exchange offer, on March 10, 2020, SpinCo merged with and into Change with each share of SpinCo common stock converted into

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. As described within “Trends and Uncertainties” above, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly. We continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business, as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.

Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA-rated U.S. government money market funds and overnight deposits with financial institutions. Deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollars. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of 

March 31, 2020

 and 

2019

 included approximately 

$1.7 billion

 and 

$1.5 billion

 of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the repatriation of cash to the United States is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes. 

Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and other current liabilities. We require a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to increase the variations in our working capital, which we will continue to monitor closely.

Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable and an increase in the current portion of long-term debt for term notes due in 2021, partially offset by an increase in receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories and a decrease in current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable. 

Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2020 primarily due to decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by the Split-off of our interest in Change Healthcare JV and share repurchases. Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2019 primarily due to a decrease in stockholder’s equity driven by share repurchases.

In July 2019, we raised our quarterly dividend from 

$0.39

 to 

$0.41

 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were 

$1.62

 per share in 

2020

, 

$1.51

 per share in 

2019

 and 

$1.30

 per share in 

2018

. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 

2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

, we paid total cash dividends of 

$294 million

, 

$292 million

 and $

262 million

. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe.

(6)

Includes agreements under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory and our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions.

The contractual obligations table above excludes the following obligations:

At 

March 31, 2020

, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately 

$784 million

. The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.

Our banks and insurance companies have issued 

$170 million

 of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at 

March 31, 2020

. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.

The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to McKesson Europe was 

$1.4 billion

 at 

March 31, 2020

, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of 

$1.2 billion

. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe received a put right that enables them to put their McKesson Europe shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”). The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. The Domination Agreement does not expire, but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six month’s advance notice.
