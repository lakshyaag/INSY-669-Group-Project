ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET AND BUSINESS RISKS

 

Foreign 

Currency Market Risk 

 

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies. We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian dollar. We have significant foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities and international sales operations.  We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows.  The goal of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures predominantly denominated in euros, Australian dollars and Singapore dollars.  Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments.  We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in Other assets current, Other assets non-current, Accrued expenses and Other liabilities non-current. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within Other income, net, on our consolidated statements of income.
