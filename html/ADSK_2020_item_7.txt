ITEM 7A. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

Our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations. We utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. In addition, we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. As of 

January 31, 2020

 and 

2019

, we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements generally within one to twelve months. Contracts were primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, British pounds, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Swiss francs, Swedish krona, and Czech koruna. We do not enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The notional amount of our option and forward contracts was $

1.72 billion

 and $

1.38 billion

 at 

January 31, 2020

 and 

2019

, respectively.

We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions. A sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of 

January 31, 2020

, indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at 

January 31, 2020

 and 

2019

, would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 

$158.8 million

 and 

$123.4 million

, respectively. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at 

January 31, 2020

 and 

2019

, would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $

119.2 million

 and $

98.3 million

, respectively.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short-term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities. At 

January 31, 2020

, we had 

$1.25 billion

 of cash equivalents and marketable securities, including 

$69.0 million

 classified as short-term marketable securities. If interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a twelve-month period, the market value change of our marketable securities would not have a material impact on our results of operations. 

OTHER MARKET RISK

From time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. Privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky. The technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. See 

Part II

,

Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Business

Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk” or the “Company”) is a world leading design software and services company, offering customers productive business solutions through powerful technology products and services. The Company serves customers in the architecture, engineering, and construction; manufacturing; and digital media, consumer, and entertainment industries. The Company’s sophisticated software products, offered through a hybrid of desktop and cloud functionality, enable its customers to experience their ideas before they are real by allowing them to imagine, design, and create their ideas and to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance early in the design process by creating digital prototypes. These capabilities allow Autodesk’s customers to foster innovation, optimize and improve their designs, help save time and money, improve quality, and collaborate with others. Autodesk software products are sold globally, both directly to customers and through a network of resellers and distributors. 

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Autodesk and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

 

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in Autodesk’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. On a regular basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Examples of significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve revenue recognition for product subscriptions and EBAs, the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, goodwill, financial instruments including strategic investments, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, and the fair value of stock awards. The Company also makes assumptions, judgments, and estimates in determining the liabilities for uncertain tax positions, variable compensation, partner incentive programs, product returns reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, asset retirement obligations, legal contingencies and operating lease liabilities.

Table of Contents 

Segments

Autodesk operates in 

one

 operating segment and accordingly, all required financial segment information is included in the consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers ("CODM") in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Autodesk reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company's CODM allocates resources and assesses the operating performance of the Company as a whole.

Revenue Recognition

Autodesk’s revenue is divided into 

three

 categories: subscription revenue, maintenance revenue, and other revenue.  Subscription revenue consists of our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business arrangements.  Maintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license. Under our maintenance plan, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades, when and if available, and technical support.  Other revenue consists of revenue from consulting, training and other services.  Other revenue also includes software license revenue from the sale of certain products which do not incorporate substantial cloud functionalities.  Revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.

Autodesk's contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether the products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. Judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between individual components of desktop software applications and cloud functionalities. This determination influences whether the desktop software is considered distinct and accounted for separately as a license performance obligation recognized at the time of delivery, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud functionalities as a single subscription performance obligation recognized over time.

For product subscriptions and flexible enterprise business agreement ("EBA") subscriptions in which the desktop software and related cloud functionalities are highly interrelated, the combined performance obligation is recognized ratably over the contract term as the subscription is delivered. For contracts involving distinct desktop software licenses, the license performance obligation is satisfied when delivered to our customers. For standalone maintenance subscriptions, cloud subscriptions, and technical support services, the performance obligation is satisfied ratably over the contract term as those services are delivered. For consulting services, the performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time as those services are delivered.

When an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations which are concurrently delivered and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (the services transfer to the customer over the contract period), we account for those performance obligations as a single performance obligation.

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. See
