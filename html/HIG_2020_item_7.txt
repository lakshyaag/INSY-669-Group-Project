KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND RATIOS

The Company considers the measures and ratios in the following discussion to be key performance indicators for its businesses. Management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the underlying trends in The Hartford’s businesses. However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the results presented in the segment discussions that follow in this MD&A. These ratios and measures may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company’s competitors.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Other Measures and Ratios

Assets Under Management (“AUM”)-

 Include mutual fund and ETP assets. AUM is a measure used by the Company's Hartford Funds segment because a significant portion of the Company’s mutual fund and ETP revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.

Book Value per Diluted Share (excluding AOCI)- 

This is a non-GAAP per share measure that i

s

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

calculated by dividing (a) common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes that excluding AOCI from the numerator is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.

 

Combined Ratio-

 The sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting losses.

Core Earnings- 

The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the Company’s operating performance. The Hartford believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Company’s ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain items. Therefore, the following items are excluded from core earnings: 

•

Certain realized capital gains and losses -  Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income.

•

Restructuring and other costs - Costs incurred as part of a restructuring plan are not a recurring operating expense of the business.

•

Loss on extinguishment of debt - Largely consisting of make-whole payments or tender premiums upon paying debt off before maturity, these losses are not a recurring operating expense of the business.

•

Gains and losses on reinsurance transactions - Gains or losses on reinsurance, such as those entered into upon sale of 

a business or to reinsure loss reserves, are not a recurring operating expense of the business.

•

Integration and transaction costs in connection with an acquired business - As transaction costs are incurred upon acquisition of a business and integration costs are completed within a short period after an acquisition, they do not represent ongoing costs of the business. 

•

Change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business - These changes in loss reserves are excluded from core earnings because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition. 

•

Deferred gain resulting from retroactive reinsurance and subsequent changes in the deferred gain - Retroactive reinsurance agreements economically transfer risk to the reinsurers and including the full benefit from retroactive reinsurance in core earnings provides greater insight into the economics of the business.

•

Change in valuation allowance on deferred taxes related to non-core components of pre-tax income - These changes in valuation allowances are excluded from core earnings because they relate to non-core components of pre-tax income, such as tax attributes like capital loss carryforwards. 

•

Results of discontinued operations - These results are excluded from core earnings for businesses sold or held for sale because such results could obscure the ability to compare period over period results for our ongoing businesses.

In addition to the above components of net income available to common stockholders that are excluded from core earnings, preferred stock dividends declared, which are excluded from net income available to common stockholders, are included in the determination of core earnings. Preferred stock dividends are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding. 

Net income (loss) and net income (loss) available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to core earnings. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or net income (loss) available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, and core earnings when reviewing the Company's performance.

Core Earnings Margin-

 The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it is an important measure of, the Group Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income margin, calculated by dividing net income by revenues, is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of Group Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses) as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. Core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Group Benefits. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Group Benefits.

Current Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio-

 A component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current accident year (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums. For U.S. events, a catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers, as defined by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk. For international events, the Company's approach is similar, informed, in part, by how Lloyd's defines catastrophes. Lloyd's is an insurance market-place operating worldwide. Lloyd's does not underwrite risks. The Company accepts risks as the sole member of its Lloyd's Syndicate. The current accident year catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums.

Expense Ratio- 

For the underwriting segments of Commercial Lines and Personal Lines is the ratio of underwriting expenses less fee income, to earned premiums. Underwriting expenses include the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and insurance operating costs and expenses, including certain centralized services costs and bad debt expense. DAC include commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other incremental direct underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.

The expense ratio for Group Benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses including amortization of intangibles and amortization of DAC, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums.

The expense ratio for Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits does not include integration and other transaction costs associated with an acquired business.

Fee Income- 

Is largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of assets under management in our Hartford Funds business. These fees are generally earned on a daily basis. Therefore, the growth in assets under management either through positive net flows or favorable market performance will have a favorable impact on fee income. Conversely, either negative net flows or unfavorable market performance will reduce fee income.

Gross New Business Premium- 

Represents the amount of premiums charged, before ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Gross new business premium plus gross renewal written premium less ceded reinsurance equals total written premium. 

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio-

 A measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for both the current and prior 

40

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

accident years. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the Company to achieve its targeted ROE fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company’s practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the rate-making process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage.

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio before Catastrophes and Prior Accident Year Development- 

A measure of the cost of non-catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. Management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development.

Loss Ratio, excluding Buyouts- 

Utilized for the Group Benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, excluding those related to buyout premiums, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. Since Group Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the profitability of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. Buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts.

Mutual Fund and Exchange-Traded Product Assets- 

Are owned by the shareholders of those products and not by the Company and, therefore, are not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements except in instances where the Company seeds new investment products and holds an investment in the fund for a period of time. Mutual fund and ETP assets are a measure used by the Company primarily because a significant portion of the Company’s Hartford Funds segment revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.

Net New Business Premium-

 Represents the amount of premiums charged, after ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Net new business premium plus renewal written premium equals total written premium.

Policies in Force-

 Represents the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. The number of 

policies in force is a growth measure used for Personal Lines and standard commercial lines (small commercial and middle market lines within middle & large commercial) within Commercial Lines and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention.

Premium Retention- 

Represents renewal premium written in the current period divided by total premium written in the prior period.

Policy Count Retention-

 Represents the ratio of the number of policies renewed during the period divided by the number of policies available to renew. The number of policies available to renew represents the number of policies, net of any cancellations, written in the previous policy term. Policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by competitors.

Policyholder Dividend Ratio-

 The ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium.

Prior Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio-

 Represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums.

Reinstatement Premiums-

 Represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of the Company ceding losses to reinsurers.

Renewal Earned Price Increase (Decrease)- 

Written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain Personal Lines automobile business and twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company’s Property and Casualty business. Since the Company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months.

Renewal Written Price Increase (Decrease)-

For Commercial Lines, represents the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure on commercial lines policies that renewed. For Personal Lines, renewal written price increases represent the total change in premium per policy since the prior year on those policies that renewed and includes the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and other changes in exposure. For Personal Lines, other changes in exposure include, but are not limited to, the effect of changes in number of drivers, vehicles and incidents, as well as changes in customer policy elections, such as deductibles and limits. The rate component represents the change in rate filed with and approved by state regulators during the period and the amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for automobiles, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers’ compensation. A number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including 

41

Table of Contents

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

expected loss costs as projected by the Company’s pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company’s underwriters and marketplace competition. Renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. Renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved.

Return on Assets ("ROA"), Core Earnings-

 The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the Hartford Funds segment’s operating performance. ROA, core earnings is calculated by dividing annualized core earnings by a daily average AUM. ROA is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that ROA, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Hartford Funds segment because it reveals trends in our business that may be obscured by the effect of items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. ROA, core earnings, should not be considered as a substitute for ROA and does not reflect the overall profitability of our Hartford Funds business. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both ROA, and ROA, core earnings when reviewing the Hartford Funds segment performance. A reconciliation of ROA to ROA, core earnings is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Hartford Funds.

Underlying Combined Ratio-

This non-GAAP financial measure of underwriting results represents the combined ratio before catastrophes, prior accident year development and current accident year change in loss reserves upon acquisition of 

a business. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The underlying combined ratio represents the combined ratio for the current accident year, excluding the impact of current accident year catastrophes and current accident year change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business. The Company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development. The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are excluded from underlying combined ratio because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our investors' ability to assess the Company's financial performance. A reconciliation of combined ratio to underlying combined ratio is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Commercial Lines and Personal Lines.

Underwriting Gain (Loss)-

 The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Commercial and Personal Lines segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax non-GAAP measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that the measure underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the Company's investing activities.

Written and Earned Premiums- 

Written premium represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results principally on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Management believes that written premium is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company’s sale of property and casualty insurance products. Written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded reinsurance premium.

Traditional life and disability insurance type products, such as those sold by Group Benefits, collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. These premiums, together with net investment income earned, are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts. Two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. Sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, customer demand for the Company’s product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the 

Company’s reputation and ratings. Persistency refers to the percentage of premium remaining in-force from year-to-year.

THE HARTFORD'S OPERATIONS

The Hartford conducts business principally in five reporting segments including Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Property & Casualty Other Operations, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. The Company includes in the Corporate category reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, restructuring costs, capital raising activities (including equity financing, debt financing and related interest expense), transaction expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition, purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill, and other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments. Corporate also includes investment management fees and expenses related to managing third party business, including management of the invested assets of Talcott Resolution Life, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Talcott Resolution"). 

43

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Talcott Resolution is the holding company of the life and annuity business that was sold in May 2018. In addition, Corporate includes a 9.7% ownership interest in the legal entity that acquired the life and annuity business sold.

The Company derives its revenues principally from: (a) premiums earned for insurance coverage provided to insureds; (b) management fees on mutual fund and ETP assets; (c) net investment income; (d) fees earned for services provided to third parties; and (e) net realized capital gains and losses. Premiums charged for insurance coverage are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in-force.

The profitability of the Company's property and casualty insurance businesses over time is greatly influenced by the Company’s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance, the size of its in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company’s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments and the Lloyd's Syndicate's ability to write business is subject to Lloyd's approval for its premium capacity each year. Most of Personal Lines written premium is associated with our exclusive licensing agreement with AARP. This agreement provides an important competitive advantage given the size of the 50 plus population and the strength of the AARP brand. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company extended this agreement through December 31, 2032.

Similar to property and casualty, profitability of the group benefits business depends, in large part, on the ability to evaluate and price risks appropriately and make reliable estimates of mortality, morbidity, disability and longevity. To manage the pricing risk, Group Benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy terms in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, loss costs, declining interest rates and other factors. However, as policies are typically sold with rate guarantees of up to three years, pricing for the Company’s products could prove to be inadequate if loss and expense trends emerge adversely during the rate guarantee period or if investment returns are lower than expected at the time the products were sold. For some of its products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments. New and renewal business for group benefits business, particularly for long-term disability, are priced using an assumption about expected investment yields over time. While the Company employs asset-liability duration matching strategies to mitigate risk and may use interest-rate sensitive derivatives to hedge its 

exposure in the Group Benefits investment portfolio, cash flow patterns related to the payment of benefits and claims are uncertain and actual investment yields could differ significantly from expected investment yields, affecting profitability of the business. In addition to appropriately evaluating and pricing risks, the profitability of the Group Benefits business depends on other factors, including the Company’s response to pricing decisions and other actions taken by competitors, its ability to offer voluntary products and self-service capabilities, the persistency of its sold business and its ability to manage its expenses which it seeks to achieve through economies of scale and operating efficiencies.

The financial results of the Company’s mutual fund and ETP businesses depend largely on the amount of assets under management and the level of fees charged based, in part, on asset share class and product type. Changes in assets under management are driven by the two main factors of net flows and the market return of the funds, which are heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity and bond markets. Net flows are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund and ETP shareholders. Financial results are highly correlated to the growth in assets under management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis.

The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company’s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses are paid. Due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations, the majority of the Company’s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale securities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient net of tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

Impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity

Impact to revenues

Earned premiums

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the economy of the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Due to government restrictions that have prevented some businesses from offering goods and services to their customers and due to shelter-in-place guidelines that have reduced business activity, many of our customers, especially small businesses, have had to curtail their operations or have found they are unable to meet cash flow needs due to declining business volume, causing some to lay off workers. As one of the largest providers of small business insurance in the U.S., in 2020, we experienced a 3% year over year decline in our small commercial written premium although trends improved in the second half of 2020. In addition 

44

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

to the expected decline in small commercial written and earned premium, other business lines in Commercial Lines have also been negatively affected due to government-mandated restrictions and stay-at-home guidelines reducing business activity and due to consumers having less disposable income or less willingness to spend on the products and services that our commercial lines policyholders sell. Excluding the effect of the Navigators acquisition, Commercial Lines written premium declined $290, or 4%, year over year driven by lower new business and due to endorsements or other changes to in-force policies that decrease premiums to reflect reduced exposures. 

Within Commercial Lines, workers’ compensation written premium declined year over year, partly due to declining payrolls as a result of the economic effects of COVID-19. 

Contributing to a 6% decline in Personal Lines written premium in 2020 was the effect of increased shopping behaviors, and lower new business levels arising out of the competitive marketplace. In addition, The Hartford provided a 15 percent refund on policyholders’ April, May and June personal automobile insurance premiums which reduced Personal Lines written and earned premiums by $81 in the second quarter of 2020. In Group Benefits, fully insured ongoing premium decreased 2% in 2020 resulting primarily from lower insured exposure on in-force policies. Because of the economic stress caused by COVID-19, we also experienced a higher amount of uncollectible premiums receivable in 2020. As a result, to reflect our higher expectation of credit losses, The Hartford increased its allowance for credit losses ("ACL") on premiums receivable by $40 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.

Net investment income and realized capital gains (losses)

Total net investment income decreased in 2020 primarily due to a lower yield on fixed maturity investments resulting from lower reinvestment rates and lower yields on floating rate securities, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets, due in part to the acquisition of Navigators Group. In an effort to stimulate the economy, central banks have reduced benchmark interest rates to near zero, impacting our yields on floating rate securities and reinvestment rates. From late March to mid-May, 2020, the Company temporarily reinvested receipts of interest and proceeds from maturing fixed maturity investments in liquid, short-term investments. While the Company resumed investing in fixed maturities in May, 2020, lower interest rates since the pandemic began have generally resulted in lower investment yields on newly invested funds. A prolonged period of lower interest rates could depress the Company's net investment income such that to earn the same level of return on equity we may have to charge higher premiums for the insurance products we sell unless loss costs similarly lessen.

Net realized capital gains (losses) on equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $(214) before tax, consisting of unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses) on equity securities held and net realized gains (losses) on equity securities sold, net of realized gains on equity derivative hedges. While equity markets in the last nine months of 2020 increased more than the value they lost during the first quarter, economic conditions remain uncertain and if equity markets were to experience similar declines as occurred in the first quarter of 2020, we may incur more net realized capital losses in future periods.

Net realized capital losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 also included $47 of increases in the allowance for credit losses, partially offset by reversals of the allowance due to improvements in market value or sales, and $5 of intent-to-sell impairments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses in the twelve month period included increases of $28 on available for sale fixed maturities and increases of $19 on commercial mortgage loans. If it takes a prolonged period for the economy to recover or if the impacts of the economic downturn are deeper than anticipated, we could experience further credit losses and intent-to-sell impairments, particularly with highly leveraged companies and issuers in the energy, commercial real estate, and travel and leisure sectors, resulting in further net realized capital losses.

Impact to direct benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses from COVID-19 claims

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded direct COVID-19 incurred losses in P&C of $278, reflecting management’s best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling COVID-19 claims incurred, including $141 for property claims, $66 for workers’ compensation, net of favorable frequency on other workers' compensation claims, and $71 of incurred losses largely concentrated in financial lines such as D&O and E&O and in surety and marine. 

Nearly all of our property insurance policies require direct physical loss or damage to property and contain standard exclusions that we believe preclude coverage for COVID-19 related claims, and the vast majority of such policies contain exclusions for virus-related losses. Included in the $141 of COVID-19 property incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the twelve month period were $101 of losses arising from a small number of property policies that do not require direct physical loss or damage and from policies intended to cover specific business needs, including crisis management and performance disruption, as well as a reserve of $40 for legal defense costs. Given the significant business disruptions that have occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced increased property claims, resulting in increased litigation activity and legal expenses. Within Property & Casualty, we incur COVID-19 workers’ compensation losses when it is determined that workers were exposed to COVID-19 out of and in the course of their employment and in other cases where states have passed laws providing for the presumption of coverage for certain industry classes, including health care and other essential workers. While current accident year losses for workers’ compensation for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $180 due to COVID-19 claims, this has been partially offset by lower claim frequency of non-COVID-19 related workers’ compensation claims due to reduced business activity, resulting in a net increase in incurred losses of $66. Favorable non-COVID-19 workers’ compensation claim frequency could continue through 2021 though possibly to a lesser extent if more business activity resumes. The Company could incur additional COVID-19 direct incurred losses in P&C through much of 2021, particularly for workers’ compensation and financial lines. 

Within Group Benefits, the Company experienced excess mortality in its group life business of $239 in 2020, primarily caused by direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19. Within the group disability business, in 2020 the Company recognized $29 of 

45

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

COVID-19 direct losses from short-term disability claims, more than offset by $38 of favorable frequency on other short-term disability claims.

Other impacts from COVID-19 and resulting economic downturn

Apart from impacts on the investment portfolio, net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses), in 2020, the Company incurred a number of other insurance business impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn as follows:

•

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an estimated decrease in current accident incurred losses in Personal Lines automobile of $218 due to a significant reduction in miles driven since the pandemic began, though miles driven has begun to increase again. In the second quarter of 2020, Personal Lines written and earned premiums were reduced by $81 due to providing automobile policyholders with premium refunds or credits in recognition of the decrease in miles driven.

•

The Company experienced the impacts of lower premium retention, including the impact of a lower exposure base on workers' compensation premium.

•

From April through approximately July of 2020, the Company waived late payment fees for a period of time for business and personal insurance customers and temporarily suspended the policy cancellation process for policyholders of our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits segments with the period of policy cancellations for non-payment varying by state.

•

Because of the economic stress caused by COVID-19 and partly due to the extension of billing terms, we expect a higher amount of uncollectible premiums receivable. As a result, to reflect our higher expectation of credit losses, The Hartford increased its ACL on premiums receivable by $40 in the year ended December 31, 2020. 

•

Apart from the increase in the premiums receivable allowance, we have experienced a decline in insurance operating costs and other expenses partly due to lower travel and employee benefits costs and lower operating costs associated with lower earned premium volumes.

Considering the impacts of COVID-19, the Company evaluated the impact of market factors on the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and determined the estimated fair values do not indicate a goodwill impairment for any reporting unit. The annual goodwill assessment for the reporting units was completed as of October 31, 2020, and resulted in no write-downs of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For information about additional resources the Company has to manage capital and liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn, refer to the Capital Resources & Liquidity section of MD&A.

For additional information about the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn, see the risk factor "The pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19 has disrupted our operations and may have a material adverse impact 

on our business results, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity" in Item 1A of Part I.

Common stockholders’ equity

Apart from the direct loss and premium impacts of COVID-19 on net income, we could also experience a reduction in AOCI within common stockholders’ equity. The net unrealized gain position on our portfolio of fixed maturities, AFS increased by $1.4 billion from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, due to an increase in valuations resulting from a decline in interest rates. If credit spreads widen going forward or if interest rates increase from the level they were at as of December 31, 2020, we would recognize a decline in the fair value of fixed maturities, AFS in future periods through a reduction of AOCI within common stockholders’ equity.

In December 2020, the Company announced a $1.5 billion equity repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors which is effective from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022. Any future repurchase of shares is dependent on market conditions and other factors including the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For further information, see Note 16 - Equity of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operational Transformation and Cost Reduction Plan

In recognition of the need to become more cost efficient and competitive along with enhancing the experience we provide to agents and customers, on July 30, 2020, the Company announced an operational transformation and cost reduction plan it refers to as Hartford Next. Through reduction of its headcount, IT investments to further enhance our capabilities, and other activities, relative to 2019, the Company expects to achieve a reduction in annual insurance operating costs and other expenses of approximately $500 by 2022. The Hartford Next program will contribute to our goal of reducing the 2022 P&C expense ratio by about 2.0 to 2.5 points, reducing the 2022 Group Benefits expense ratio by about 1.5 to 2.0 points and reducing our 2022 claim expense ratio by approximately 0.5 point.

To achieve those expected savings, we expect to incur approximately $410, with $153 expensed over the last six months of 2020, and expected expenses of $110 in 2021, $77 in 2022 and $70 after 2022, with the expenses after 2022 consisting mostly of amortization of internal use software and capitalized real estate costs. The estimated costs of approximately $410 includes an expected $54 in capitalized development costs for internal use software to be amortized over the useful life of the software, typically 3 years, and approximately $23 of capitalized real estate assets to be amortized over their useful lives. Included in the estimated costs of $410, we expect to incur restructuring costs of approximately $158, including $73 of employee severance, and approximately $85 of other costs, including consulting expenses and the cost to retire certain IT applications.

Restructuring costs are reported as a charge to net income but not in core earnings. All other costs of the Hartford Next program will be included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Relative to 2019 full year actual expenses, the Company recognized a net increase in insurance operating costs and other expenses of approximately 

46

Table of Contents

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

$47 over the last six months of 2020 and expects a net expense reduction of approximately $240 in 2021 and approximately $423 in 2022.

The following table presents Hartford Next program costs incurred, including restructuring costs, and expense savings realized in 2020 from the inception of the program on July 30, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and expected costs and expense savings in each year through the expected completion of the program on December 31, 2022:

Revenue

Earned Premiums

[1]

For the years ended 2020 and 2019, the total includes $9 and $10, respectively, recorded in Corporate other revenue.

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019

Earned premiums 

increased primarily due to:

•

An increase in Property and Casualty reflecting a 7% increase in Commercial Lines driven by the Navigators Group acquisition, partially offset by a 6% decline in Personal Lines. Driving part of the decrease in Personal Lines earned premiums was the impact of the Company offering a 15 percent credit on policyholders’ April, May and June personal automobile insurance premiums totaling $81.

•

A 1% decrease in Group Benefits, principally driven by a decline in group life due to lower insured exposure on in-force policies.

Fee income

 decreased due to:

•

Lower fee income in Hartford Funds largely due to a shift in mix of assets to lower fee generating funds, lower installment fee income in P&C and lower fee income on administrative services only business in Group Benefits.

Other revenues

 decreased primarily due to a decrease in income generated from the Talcott Resolution investment and less transition services revenue received related to the sale of the life and annuity business in 2018.

Net Investment Income

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019

Net investment income 

decreased primarily due to:

•

Lower yield on fixed maturity investments resulting from lower reinvestment rates and lower yields on floating rate securities, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets, due in part to the acquisition of Navigators Group.

Net realized capital gains (losses)

 decreased from net gains in the 2019 period to net losses in the 2020 period, primarily driven by:

•

Depreciation in the value of equity securities due to the significant decline in equity market levels in the first quarter of 2020 as well as realized losses upon sales of equity securities, partially offset by net realized gains upon termination of derivatives used to hedge against a decline in equity market levels.

•

A loss of $48, before tax, on sale of the Company’s Continental Europe Operations, which the Company agreed to sell in September of 2020, net credit losses recognized on fixed maturities and an increase in the ACL on mortgage loans, partially offset by slightly higher net gains on sales of fixed maturity securities.

Benefits, losses and expenses

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019

Losses and LAE Incurred for P&C

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses

 increased due to:

•

An increase in incurred losses for Property & Casualty which was driven by an increase in Commercial Lines, partially offset by a decrease in Personal Lines, and was attributable to:

–

An increase in Property & Casualty current accident year ("CAY") loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes due to the effect on incurred losses of earned premium from the Navigators Group acquisition and COVID-19 incurred losses of $278 which is net of favorable frequency of workers’ compensation claims due to reduced business activity and lower payrolls. Partially offsetting the increase were lower weather-related non-COVID-19 non-catastrophe property claims and lower claim frequency in personal automobile due to shelter-in-place guidelines reducing miles driven. 

–

An increase in current accident year catastrophe losses of $143 before tax. Current accident year catastrophe losses for 2020 were primarily from civil unrest, a number of hurricanes and tropical storms, Pacific Coast wildfires and Northeast windstorms as well as tornado, wind and hail events in the South, Midwest and Central Plains. Catastrophe losses in the 2019 period were primarily from tornado, wind and hail events in the South, Midwest and Mountain West and winter storms across the country as well as from hurricanes and tropical storms in the Southeast. For additional information, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property & Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.

–

Partially offset by more favorable Property & Casualty net prior accident year reserve development of $71, before tax. Prior accident year reserve development in the 2020 period was a favorable $136 before tax, with $529 of reserve reductions related to catastrophes, including decreases in estimated losses arising from wind and hail events in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and from the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires, including a $289 before tax subrogation benefit from PG&E. Reserve development in 2020 also included a $254 before tax increase in reserves for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims, a $208 before tax increase in A&E reserves and a $102 before tax increase in reserves on Navigators related to 2018 and prior accident years. While $220 of A&E and $102 of Navigators’ reserve development has been economically ceded to NICO, the Company recognized a $312 deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting with $10 of the $220 ceded A&E losses recognized as a benefit to income in 2020. Prior accident year development in 2019 primarily included reserve decreases for workers’ compensation, small commercial package business, catastrophes, personal lines automobile liability, and uncollectible reinsurance, partially offset by increases in general liability and professional liability, including increases in Navigators Group reserves upon acquisition of the business, and commercial lines automobile liability. For further discussion, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property & Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.

Losses and LAE Incurred for Group Benefits

 

•

Losses and LAE increased in Group Benefits driven by higher mortality on group life claims, primarily caused by direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by the impact of a lower group disability loss ratio driven by lower claim incidence and increased favorable prior incurral year development.

For further discussion of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the impact of COVID-19 on our financial

condition, results of operations and liquidity section of this MD&A

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 

increased from the prior year period primarily due to an increase in Commercial Lines mainly attributable to the impact of the Navigators Group acquisition, partially offset by decreases in Personal Lines and Group Benefits consistent with the decline in earned premium in those segments.

Insurance operating costs and other expenses

 decreased due to:

•

A reduction in incentive compensation and employee travel and benefits costs, a reduction in contingent consideration of $12 before tax in Hartford Funds associated with the acquisition of Lattice, and expense reductions from the Company’s Hartford Next operational and transformation cost reduction plan.

•

Partially offsetting the decrease in expenses were a $40 before tax increase in the ACL on uncollectible premiums receivable in 2020 due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 and higher information technology costs within 

Group Benefits and middle & large commercial, partially offset by Personal Lines technology expenses incurred in 2019. In addition, 2020 included a full year of operating costs incurred due to the Navigators Group acquisition in May of 2019, partially offset by lower integration and transaction costs in 2020.

Restructuring and other costs 

are due to the Company's Hartford Next operational transformation and cost reduction plan which includes $73 of incurred severance costs.

For further discussion of impacts resulting from the Hartford Next initiative, see MD&A - The Hartford's Operations, Operational Transformation and Cost Reduction Plan and Note 23 - Restructuring and Other Costs of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income tax expense 

decreased primarily due to a decline in income before tax.

For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 17 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Total net investment income

 decreased primarily due to a lower yield on fixed maturity investments resulting from lower reinvestment rates and lower yields on floating rate securities, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets, due in part to the acquisition of Navigators Group.

Annualized net investment income yield, 

excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments and non-routine items on fixed maturities, which primarily include make-whole payments and prepayment fees, partially offset by paydowns, was down primarily due to lower reinvestment and short-term rates.

Average reinvestment rate, 

on fixed maturities and mortgage loans, excluding certain U.S. Treasury securities, for the 

year-ended December 31, 2020, was 2.5% which was below the average yield of sales and maturities of 3.4% for the same period. The average reinvestment rate for the year-ended December 31, 2019 was 3.4% which was below the average yield of sales and maturities of 4.0%.

For the 2021 calendar year, we expect the annualized net investment income yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments and non-routine items on fixed maturities, to be lower than the portfolio yield earned for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a lower yield on short-term investments and lower reinvestment rates. The estimated impact on net investment income yield is subject to change due to evolving market conditions and active portfolio management.

Year ended December 31, 2020

Gross gains and losses on sales 

were primarily driven by issuer-specific sales of corporate securities and tax-exempt municipal bonds, rebalancing within the foreign government sector, and sales of U.S. treasury securities for duration and/or liquidity management.

Equity securities 

net losses were driven by mark-to-market losses due to the decline in equity market levels in the first quarter and losses incurred on sales across multiple issuers as the Company reduced its exposure to equity securities, partially offset by mark-to-market equity gains given recent equity market performance and tighter credit spreads, which resulted in price appreciation of preferred equities.

Other, net

 gains are primarily due to $75 of realized gains on terminated derivatives used to hedge against a decline in equity market levels and $21 of gains on interest rate derivatives due to a decline in interest rates. These gains were partially offset by a loss of $48, before tax, on the sale of the Company’s Continental Europe Operations which the Company agreed to sell in September of 2020.

Year ended December 31, 2019

Gross gains and losses on sales 

were primarily driven by issuer-specific selling of corporate securities, continued reduction of tax-exempt municipal bonds and sales of U.S. treasuries for duration management.

Equity securities 

net gains were primarily driven by appreciation of equity securities due to higher equity market levels. 

Other, net

 losses includes losses on interest rate derivatives of $34 due to higher rates, losses on equity derivatives of $17 due 

to an increase in domestic equity markets, and losses of $9 due to foreign currency revaluation. These losses were partially offset by gains on credit derivatives of $27 due to credit spread tightening.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.

The Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:

•

property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance;

•

group benefit long-term disability ("LTD") reserves, net of reinsurance;

•

evaluation of goodwill for impairment;

•

valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and ACL on mortgage loans; and

•

contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.

54

Table of Contents

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements.

Overview of Reserving for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims

It typically takes many months or years to pay claims incurred under a property and casualty insurance product; accordingly, the Company must establish reserves at the time the loss is incurred. Most of the Company’s policies provide for occurrence-based 

55

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

coverage where the loss is incurred when a claim event happens like an automobile accident, house or building fire or injury to an employee under a workers’ compensation policy. Some of the Company's policies, mostly for directors and officers insurance and errors and omissions insurance, are claims-made policies where the loss is incurred in the period the claim event is reported to the Company even if the loss event itself occurred in an earlier period.

Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves provide for the estimated ultimate costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company, less amounts paid to date. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims and the actual loss and loss adjustment expenses reported to the Company by claimants (“reported losses”). Reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims. For most lines, Company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (IBNR and case reserves) on an accident year basis. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported. For certain lines acquired from the Navigators Group book of business, total reserves are evaluated on a policy year basis and then converted to accident year. A policy year is the calendar year in which a policy incepts. 

Factors that Change Reserve Estimates- 

Reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment. Inflation in claim costs, such as with medical care, hospital care, automobile parts, wages and home and building repair, would cause claims to settle for more than they are initially reserved. Changes in the economy can cause an increase or decrease in the number of reported claims (claim frequency). For example, an improving economy could result in more automobile miles driven and a higher number of automobile reported claims, or a change in economic conditions can lead to more or less workers’ compensation reported claims. An increase in the number or percentage of claims litigated can increase the average settlement amount per claim (claim severity). Changes in the judicial environment can affect interpretations of damages and how policy coverage applies which could increase or decrease claim severity. Over time, judges or juries in certain jurisdictions may be more inclined to determine liability and award damages. New legislation can also change how damages are defined or change the statutes of limitations for the filing of civil suits, resulting in greater claim frequency or severity. In addition, new types of injuries may arise from exposures not contemplated when the policies were written. Past examples include pharmaceutical products, silica, lead paint, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and construction defects.

Reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal Company operations. A delay or acceleration in handling claims may signal a need to increase or reduce reserves from what was initially estimated. New lines of business may have loss development patterns that are not well established. Changes in the geographic mix of business, changes in the mix of business 

by industry and changes in the mix of business by policy limit or deductible can increase the risk that losses will ultimately develop differently than the loss development patterns assumed in our reserving. In addition, changes in the quality of risk selection in underwriting and changes in interpretations of policy language could increase or decrease ultimate losses from what was assumed in establishing the reserves.

In the case of assumed reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. The Company assumes property and casualty risks from other insurance companies as part of its Global Re business acquired from Navigators Group and from certain pools and associations. Global Re, which is a part of the global specialty business, mostly assumes property, casualty, surety, agriculture, and marine risks and, until recently, assumed accident and health insurance risks. Changes in the case reserving and reporting patterns of insurance companies ceding to The Hartford can create additional uncertainty in estimating the reserves. Due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates of direct and assumed reserves, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future.

Reinsurance Recoverables- 

Through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks it has underwritten to other insurance companies. The Company records reinsurance recoverables for loss and loss adjustment expenses ceded to its reinsurers representing the anticipated recovery from reinsurers of unpaid claims, including IBNR. 

The Company estimates the portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses to be ceded based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of IBNR for losses that will ultimately be ceded.

The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. The ACL primarily considers the credit quality of the Company's reinsurers while the allowance for disputes considers recent outcomes in arbitration and litigation in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and recent commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants that may signal how the Company’s own reinsurance claims may settle. Where its reinsurance contracts permit, the Company secures funding of future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $105 as of December 31, 2020, comprised of $44 related to Commercial Lines, $1 related to Personal Lines and $60 related to Property & Casualty Other Operations.

The Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for direct and assumed exposures.

Review of Reserve Adequacy- 

The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business or more detailed level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. 

56

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

For Property & Casualty Other Operations, asbestos and environmental (“Run-off A&E”) reserves are reviewed by type of event rather than by line of business. 

Reserve adjustments, which may be material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. In the judgment of management, information currently available has been properly considered in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and in recording the reinsurance recoverables for ceded unpaid losses.

Reserving Methodology

The following is a discussion of the reserving methods used for the Company's property and casualty lines of business other than asbestos and environmental.

Reserves are set by line of business within the operating segments. A single line of business may be written in more than one segment. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest-tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property, marine and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability, professional liability and assumed reinsurance. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.

Use of Actuarial Methods and Judgments- 

The Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. New methods may be added for specific lines over time to inform these selections where appropriate. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. Most reserves are reviewed fully each quarter, including loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for homeowners, commercial property, marine, automobile physical damage, automobile liability, package property business, and workers’ compensation. Other reserves, including most general liability and professional liability lines, are reviewed semi-annually. Certain additional reserves are also reviewed semi-annually or annually, including reserves for losses incurred in accident years older than twelve years for Personal Lines and older than twenty years for Commercial Lines, as well as reserves for bond, assumed reinsurance, latent exposures such as construction defects, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses. For reserves that are reviewed semi-annually or annually, management monitors the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters and, if necessary, performs a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change.

An expected loss ratio is used in initially recording the reserves for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business. This expected loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of 

recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period.

As losses emerge or develop in periods subsequent to a given accident year, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more influence vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates representing a range of actuarial indications.

Reserve Discounting- 

Most of the Company’s property and casualty insurance product reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted a portion of workers’ compensation reserves that have a fixed and determinable payment stream. For further discussion of these discounted liabilities, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Differences Between GAAP and Statutory Basis Reserves- 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, U.S. property and casualty insurance product reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables, reported under U.S. GAAP were lower than net reserves reported on a statutory basis, primarily due to reinsurance recoverables on two ceded retroactive reinsurance agreements that are recorded as a reduction of other liabilities under statutory accounting. One of the retroactive reinsurance agreements covers substantially all adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves subsequent to 2016 and the other covers adverse development on Navigators Insurers' existing net loss and allocated loss adjustment reserves as of December 31, 2018. Under both agreements, the Company cedes to NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire").

Reserving Methods by Line of Business- 

Apart from Run-off A&E which is discussed in the following section on Property & Casualty Other Operations, below is a general discussion of which reserving methods are preferred by line of business. Because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business (e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), other methods than those described for the line of business may also be employed for a coverage and accident year within a line of business. Also, as circumstances change, the methods that are given more influence will change.

57

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Preferred Reserving Methods by Line of Business

Commercial property, homeowners and automobile physical damage

These short-tailed lines are fast-developing and paid and reported development techniques are used as these methods use historical data to develop paid and reported loss development patterns, which are then applied to cumulative paid and reported losses by accident period to estimate ultimate losses. In addition to paid and reported development methods, for the most immature accident months, the Company uses frequency and severity techniques and the initial expected loss ratio. The advantage of frequency/severity techniques is that frequency estimates are generally easier to predict and external information can be used to supplement internal data in estimating average severity.

Personal automobile liability

For personal automobile liability, and bodily injury in particular, in addition to traditional paid and reported development methods, the Company relies on frequency/severity techniques and Berquist-Sherman techniques. Because the paid development technique is affected by changes in claim closure patterns and the reported development method is affected by changes in case reserving practices, the Company uses Berquist-Sherman techniques which adjust these patterns to reflect current settlement rates and case reserving practices. The Company generally uses the reported development method for older accident years and a combination of reported development, frequency/severity and Berquist-Sherman methods for more recent accident years. For older accident periods, reported losses are a good indicator of ultimate losses given the high percentage of ultimate losses reported to date. For more recent periods, the frequency/severity techniques are not affected as much by changes in case reserve practices and changing disposal rates and the Berquist-Sherman techniques specifically adjust for these changes. 

Commercial automobile liability

The Company performs a variety of techniques, including the paid and reported development methods and frequency/severity techniques. For older, more mature accident years, the Company primarily uses reported development techniques. For more recent accident years, the Company relies on several methods that incorporate expected loss ratios, reported loss development, paid loss development, frequency/severity, case reserve adequacy, and claim settlement rates.

Professional liability

Reported and paid loss development patterns for this line tend to be volatile. Therefore, the Company typically relies on frequency and severity techniques.

General liability, bond and large deductible workers’ compensation

For these long-tailed lines of business, the Company generally relies on the expected loss ratio and reported development techniques. The Company generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the expected loss ratio method at early ages of development and shifting more weight onto the reported development method as an accident year matures. For certain general liability lines the Company uses a Berquist-Sherman technique to adjust for changes in claim reserving patterns. The Company also uses various frequency/severity methods aimed at capturing large loss development.

Workers’ compensation

Workers’ compensation is the Company’s single largest reserve line of business and a wide range of methods are used. Due to the long-tailed nature of workers' compensation, the selection of methods is driven by expected loss ratio methods ("ELR") at early evaluations with emphasis shifting first to Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, then to paid and reported development methods (with more reliance placed on paid methods), and finally to methods that are responsive to the inventory of open claims. Across these techniques, there are adjustments related to changes in emergence patterns across years, projections of future cost inflation, outlier claims, and analysis of larger states.

Marine

For marine liability, the Company generally relies on the expected loss ratio, Berquist-Sherman, and reported development techniques. The Company generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the expected loss ratio method at early ages of development and then shifts towards Berquist-Sherman and then more towards the reported development method as an accident year matures. For marine property segments, the Company relies on a Berquist-Sherman method for early development ages then shifts to reported development techniques.

Assumed reinsurance and all other

Standard methods, such as expected loss ratio, Berquist-Sherman and reported development techniques are applied. These methods and analyses are informed by underlying treaty by treaty analyses supporting the expected loss ratios, and cedant data will often inform the loss development patterns. In some instances, reserve indications may also be influenced by information gained from claims and underwriting audits. For the A&H business where the reporting is quick and treaties are not written evenly throughout the year, policy quarter analyses are performed to avoid potential distortions. Policy quarter and policy year loss reserve estimates are then converted to an accident year basis.

Allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE")

For some lines of business (e.g., professional liability, assumed reinsurance, and the acquired Navigators Group book of business), ALAE and losses are analyzed together. For most lines of business, however, ALAE is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and a ratio of paid ALAE to paid loss is applied to loss reserves to estimate unpaid ALAE.

Unallocated loss adjustment expenses ("ULAE")

ULAE is analyzed separately from loss and ALAE. For most lines of business, future ULAE costs to be paid are projected based on an expected claim handling cost per claim year, the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ULAE to paid loss is applied to estimated unpaid losses. For some lines, a simplified paid-to-paid approach is used.

In the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident 

year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to the prior periods. The Company also considers the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the Company determines the appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. In general, adjustments are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Such adjustments of reserves are referred to as “prior accident year development”. Increases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either an increase in prior accident year reserves or as unfavorable reserve development. Decreases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either a decrease in prior accident year reserves or as favorable reserve development. Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results. 

For a discussion of changes to reserve estimates recorded in 2020, see Note 12 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Current Trends Contributing to Reserve Uncertainty

The Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty insurance business. The Hartford is, therefore, subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from changes in loss trends and other conditions which could become material at any point in time. As market conditions and loss trends develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend that should result in a reserving action (i.e., increasing or decreasing the reserve).

General liability- 

Within Commercial Lines, including the acquired Navigators Group book of business, and Property & Casualty Other Operations, the Company has exposure to general liability claims, including from bodily injury, property damage and product liability. Reserves for these exposures can be particularly difficult to estimate due to the long development pattern and uncertainty about how cases will settle. In particular, the Company has exposure to bodily injury claims that is the result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances. Examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries and lead paint. The Company also has exposure to claims from construction defects, where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. In addition, the Company has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions, and other organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America, relating to sexual molestation and sexual abuse. State “reviver” statutes, extending statutes of limitations for certain sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims, could result in additional litigation or could result in unexpected sexual molestation and sexual abuse losses. Such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods, which can raise complex coverage issues with significant effects on the ultimate scope of coverage. Such exposures may also be impacted by insured bankruptcies. These factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. With regard to these exposures, the Company monitors trends in litigation, the external environment including legislation, the similarities to other mass torts and the potential impact on the Company’s reserves. Additionally, uncertainty in estimated claim severity causes reserve variability, particularly with respect to changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices.

Workers’ compensation-

 Included in both small commercial and in middle & large commercial, workers’ compensation is the Company’s single biggest line of business and the property and casualty line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. To the extent that patterns in the frequency of settlement payments deviate from historical patterns, loss reserve estimates would be less reliable. Medical costs make up approximately 50% of workers’ compensation payments. As such, reserve estimates for workers’ compensation are particularly sensitive to changes in medical inflation, the changing use of medical care procedures and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments. In addition, a deteriorating economic environment can reduce the ability of an injured worker to return to work and lengthen the time a worker receives disability benefits. In National Accounts, reserves for large deductible workers’ compensation insurance require estimating losses attributable to the deductible amount that will be paid by the insured; if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the Company is contractually liable. 

Commercial Lines automobile- 

Uncertainty in estimated claim severity causes reserve variability for commercial automobile losses including reserve variability due to changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as due to changes in the external environment. 

Directors' and officers' insurance- 

Uncertainty regarding the number and severity of class action suits can result in reserve volatility for both directors' and officers' insurance claims. Additionally, the Company’s exposure to losses under directors’ and officers’ insurance policies, both domestically and internationally, is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex. 

Personal Lines automobile- 

While claims emerge over relatively shorter periods, estimates can still vary due to a number of factors, including uncertain estimates of frequency and severity trends. Severity trends are affected by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as by changes in the external environment. Changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. Severity trends have increased in recent accident years, in part driven by more expensive parts associated with new automobile technology, causing additional uncertainty about the reliability of past patterns. In addition, the introduction of new products and class plans has led to a different mix of business by type of insured than the Company experienced in the past. Such changes in mix increase the uncertainty of the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the new business.

Assumed reinsurance- 

While the pricing and reserving processes can be challenging and idiosyncratic for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of setting prices and estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer. This is primarily due to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of claims to the reinsurer, the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing pricing and reserving practices among ceding companies. In addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or impact liability

development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future. As a result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the expected estimates.

International business-

 In addition to several of the line-specific trends listed above, the International business acquired through the Navigators Group book of business may have additional uncertainty due to geopolitical, foreign currency, and trade dispute risks. 

COVID-19 impacts- 

As further explained under "Impacts of COVID-19" within The Hartford's Operations section of MD&A, through December 31, 2020, the Company incurred $278 of COVID-19 claims in P&C, including in workers' compensation, property and financial lines. Under workers’ compensation, we could experience a continuation of COVID-19 incurred losses, particularly due to laws or directives in certain states that require coverage of COVID-19 claims for health care and other essential workers based on a presumption that they contracted the virus while working. We could also incur losses on general liability policies if claimants can successfully assert that insureds were negligent from protecting employees, customers and others from exposure though we do not expect this exposure to be significant. Under commercial property policies, we have reserved for business interruption claims that pertain to policies in middle & large commercial and in global specialty which do not require direct physical loss or property damage. We have also experienced an increase in COVID-19 related claims under director's and officer's insurance policies. In other cases, particularly in small commercial, where there are policy exclusions and the requirement that there be direct physical loss or damage to the property, we have not recorded loss reserves as there is no coverage though we have recorded a reserve for legal defense costs.

In addition to the direct impacts of COVID-19 mentioned above, we are monitoring for indirect impacts as well. In our commercial surety lines there continues to be the potential for elevated frequency and severity due to an increase in the number of bankruptcies, especially in small businesses and impacted industries such as hospitality, entertainment and transportation. In construction surety, there is the potential for elevated losses from contractors who experience project shutdowns or payment delays, which negatively impact their cash flows, or result in disruptions in their supply chains, labor shortages or inflation in the cost of materials. 

Reserve estimates for COVID-19 claims are difficult to estimate. In establishing reserves for COVID-19 incurred claims through December 31, 2020, we have provided IBNR at a higher percentage of ultimate estimated incurred losses than usual as we expect longer claim reporting patterns given the economic effects of COVID-19. For example, we expect longer delays than usual between the time a worker is treated and the date the claim is eventually submitted for workers' compensation coverage. Reserve estimates for D&O, E&O and employment practices liability are subject to significant uncertainty given that estimates must be made of the expected ultimate severity of claims that have recently been reported. Several lines have experienced a decline in frequency during the pandemic months; however, uncertainty remains with respect to severity given the pandemic's potential impact on economic activity, driving behaviors, and the healthcare and legal systems. Changes in the legal environment and litigation process, including but not limited 

to court delays and closings, may also have potential impacts on development patterns for liability lines.

Impact of Key Assumptions on Reserves 

As stated above, the Company’s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements within its reserve estimation process. The Company does not consistently use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges.

Across most lines of business, the most important reserve assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. The trend in loss cost frequency and severity is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.

The following discussion discloses possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key indicators of potential losses. For automobile liability lines in both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines, the key indicator is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. For workers’ compensation and general liability, loss development patterns are a key indicator, particularly for more mature accident years. For workers’ compensation, paid loss development patterns have been impacted by medical cost inflation and other changes in loss cost trends. For general liability, incurred loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., construction defect claims) and a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims. 

Each of the impacts described below is estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key indicators or among lines of business. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company’s reserves in total. For any one reserving line of business, the estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key indicators is a reasonable estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. The variation discussed is not meant to be a worst-case scenario, and, therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than the amounts discussed below.

Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims

How A&E Reserves are Set-

 The process for establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims first involves estimating the required reserves gross of ceded reinsurance and then estimating reinsurance recoverables.

In establishing reserves for gross asbestos claims, the Company evaluates its insureds’ estimated liabilities for such claims by examining exposures for individual insureds and assessing how coverage applies. The Company considers a variety of factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and anticipated future claim activity, the level of plaintiff demands, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.

Similarly, the Company reviews exposures to establish gross environmental reserves. The Company considers several factors in estimating environmental liabilities, including historical values of similar claims, the number of sites involved, the insureds’ alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, the appropriateness and cost of remediation, the nature of governmental enforcement activities or mandated remediation efforts and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.

After evaluating its insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the Company evaluates the insurance coverage in place for such claims. The Company considers its insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the Company. The Company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language, the nature of how policy limits are enforced on multi-year policies and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.

The estimated liabilities of insureds and the Company’s exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This analysis is conducted by the Company’s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.

For both asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company also analyzes its historical paid and reported losses and expenses year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity. The historical losses and expenses are analyzed on both a direct basis and net of reinsurance. 

Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined for its insureds by each policy year, the Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company’s experience with reinsurance collections. See the section that follows entitled A&E Adverse Development Cover that discusses the impact the reinsurance agreement with NICO may have on future adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves, if any.

Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of A&E Reserves- 

A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment, resolution of coverage disputes with our policyholders and the expense to indemnity ratio. Reserve estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to greater variability than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures. 

The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. Future developments could continue to cause the Company to change its estimates of its gross asbestos and environmental reserves. Losses ceded under the adverse development cover ("A&E ADC") with NICO in excess of the ceded premium paid of $650 have resulted in a deferred gain resulting in a timing difference between when gross reserves are increased and when reinsurance recoveries are recognized. This timing difference results in a charge to net income until such periods when the recoveries are recognized. Consistent with past practice, the Company will continue to monitor its reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations regularly, including its annual reviews of asbestos liabilities, reinsurance recoverables, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, and environmental liabilities. Where future developments indicate, we will make appropriate adjustments to the reserves at that time. 

Total P&C Insurance Product Reserves Development

In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2020 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves, it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims 

61

may change in the future and that the required adjustment to currently recorded reserves could be material to the Company’s results of operations and liquidity.

In December, 2019, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy of PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (together, “PG&E”) approved an $11 billion settlement of insurance subrogation claims to resolve all such claims arising 

from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp wildfire. That settlement was contingent upon, among other things, the judge entering an order confirming PG&E’s chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (“PG&E Plan”) incorporating the settlement

agreement. On June 20, 2020, the bankruptcy court judge approved the PG&E Plan and PG&E subsequently transferred the $11 billion settlement amount to a trust designed to allocate and distribute the settlement among subrogation holders, including certain of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an estimated $289 

subrogation benefit though the ultimate amount it collects will depend on how the Company’s ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation compare to other insurers’ ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation. In 2020, the Company received distributions, net of attorney costs, of $227.

Property & Casualty Other Operations 

Net reserves and reserve activity in Property & Casualty Other Operations are categorized and reported as asbestos, environmental, and “all other”. The “all other” category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, head injuries, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and other long-tail liabilities. In addition to various insurance and assumed reinsurance exposures, "all other" includes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. "All other" also includes the Company’s allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. When the Company commutes a ceded reinsurance contract or settles a ceded reinsurance dispute, net reserves for the related cause of loss (including asbestos, environmental or all other) are increased for the portion of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance attributable to that commutation or settlement. 

P&C Other Operations

 Total Reserves, Net of Reinsurance 

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

The vast majority of the Company's exposure to A&E relates to policy coverages provided prior to 1986, reported within the P&C Other Operations segment (“Run-off A&E”). In addition, since 1986, the Company has written asbestos and environmental exposures under general liability policies and pollution liability under homeowners policies, which are reported in the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments.

A&E Adverse Development Cover

Effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an A&E ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire, to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development. Under the A&E ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves 

as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion, including both Run-off A&E and A&E reserves in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed in a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The A&E ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.

Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid have been recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid have resulted in a deferred gain. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has incurred a cumulative $860 in adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO, including $898 for Run-off A&E reserves and ($38) for A&E reserves in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. As such, $640 of coverage is available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. As a result, the Company has recorded a $210 deferred gain within other liabilities, representing the difference between the reinsurance recoverable of $860 and ceded premium paid of $650. The deferred gain is recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims will result in charges against earnings, which may be significant. 

Net and Gross Survival Ratios

Net and gross survival ratios are a measure of the quotient of the carried reserves divided by average annual payments (net of reinsurance and on a gross basis) and is an indication of the number of years that carried reserves would last (i.e. survive) if future annual payments were consistent with the calculated historical average.

Since December 31, 2016, asbestos and environmental net reserves have been declining since all adverse development has been ceded to NICO, up to a limit of $1.5 billion and the deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance has been recorded within other liabilities rather than in net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Recoveries from NICO will not be collected until the Company has cumulative loss payments of more than the $1.7 billion carrying value of net reserves as of December 31, 2016. Accordingly, the payment of losses without any current collection of recoveries from NICO has reduced the Company’s net loss reserves which decreases the net survival ratios such that, unadjusted, the net survival ratios would not be representative of the true number of years of average loss payments covered by the reserves. Therefore, the net survival ratios presented in the table below are calculated before considering the effect of the A&E ADC reinsurance agreement but net of other reinsurance in place.

Annual Reserve Reviews

Review of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

The Company performs its regular comprehensive annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves in the fourth quarter, including both Run-off A&E (P&C Other Operations) and asbestos and environmental reserves included in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. As part of the evaluation of asbestos and environmental reserves in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos and environmental liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts. 

2020 comprehensive annual reviews

As a result of the 2020 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated asbestos reserves before NICO reinsurance in P&C Other Operations by $130, primarily due to an increase in the rate of asbestos claims settlements for both mesothelioma 

and non-mesothelioma claims. In addition, average settlement values and defense costs were higher than anticipated, driven by elevated plaintiff demands. Overall, the number of claim filings in the period covered by the 2020 study was roughly flat with the 2019 study, driven by an increase in non-mesothelioma claim filings, while the number of mesothelioma claim filings decreased as expected. The increase in asbestos reserves was offset by $132 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty, recognizing ($2) in reserve releases not subject to the NICO treaty.

As a result of the 2020 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated environmental reserves before NICO reinsurance in P&C Other Operations by $106, primarily due to an increasing number of claims and suits alleging contamination from or exposure to per & polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"). In addition, higher than anticipated remediation costs and legal defense costs also contributed to the reserve increase. The increase in environmental reserves was offset by a $106 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.

The total $236 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves in P&C Other Operations was offset by a $238 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty, with a ($2) release in asbestos reserves not subject to the NICO treaty. Including a reduction of asbestos and environmental reserves in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines, the net increase in A&E reserves ceded to the A&E ADC in 2020 was $220 offset by a $220 increase in reinsurance recoverables under the NICO treaty. However, since cumulative losses ceded to the A&E ADC of $860 exceed the $650 of ceded premium paid, the Company recognized a $210 increase in deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance, resulting in the Company recording a charge to earnings of $208 in 2020, consisting of the $210 deferred gain net of the $2 of favorable development on A&E reserves not subject to the NICO treaty.

2019 comprehensive annual reviews

During the 2019 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated asbestos reserves before NICO reinsurance in P&C Other Operations by $76, primarily due to an increase in average settlement values, most notably from mesothelioma claims, driven by elevated plaintiff demands. In addition, cost-sharing agreements and settlements with certain insureds reduced the uncertainty of the Company’s asbestos liability but resulted in a reserve increase. Partially offsetting the adverse development was a decrease in the number of claim filings, most notably from mesothelioma claims. The increase in reserves was offset by a $76 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.

As a result of the 2019 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated environmental reserves before NICO reinsurance in P&C Other Operations by $56, primarily due to regulatory remediation requirements that changed in 2019 for certain sites polluted by coal ash and resulted in more costly and extensive remediation plans, a higher than anticipated number of claims associated with PFAS, and increased defense and cleanup costs associated with Superfund sites. The increase in environmental reserves was offset by a $56 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.

The total $132 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves in P&C Other Operations was offset by a $132 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty. Including a reduction of asbestos and environmental reserves in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines, the net increase in A&E reserves in 2019 was $117 offset by a $117 increase in reinsurance recoverables under the NICO treaty.

Major Categories of Asbestos Accounts

Direct asbestos exposures include both Known and Unallocated Direct Accounts.

•

Known Direct Accounts-

 includes both Major Asbestos Defendants and Non-Major Accounts, and represent approximately 71% of the Company's total Direct gross asbestos reserves as of December 31, 2020 compared to approximately 73% as of December 31, 2019. Major Asbestos Defendants have been defined as the “Top 70” accounts in Tillinghast's published Tiers 1 and 2 and Wellington accounts, while Non-Major accounts are comprised of all other direct asbestos accounts and largely represent smaller and more peripheral defendants. Major Asbestos Defendants have the fewest number of asbestos accounts.

•

Unallocated Direct Accounts-

 includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the Company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. These exposures represent approximately 29% of the Company's Direct gross asbestos reserves as of December 31, 2020 compared to approximately 27% as of December 31, 2019.

Review of "All Other" Reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations

Prior year development on all other reserves resulted in increases of $50, $21 and $65, respectively for calendar years 2020, 2019 and 2018. Included in the 2020 adverse reserve development was a $35 increase in reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses ("ULAE"), primarily due to an increase in expected aggregate claim handling costs associated with asbestos and environmental claims, as well as higher than anticipated unallocated loss adjustment expenses in recent years, prompting an increase in the projected run rate expense. In addition, elevated claim activity related to certain mass torts and assumed residual value policies contributed to the overall reserve increases, offset by favorable development from previously disputed or potentially uncollectible reinsurance.

The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best estimate of 

reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. In performing its assessment, the Company evaluates the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in Property & Casualty Other Operations. In conducting these evaluations, the company used its most recent detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment. The Company analyzed the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers, and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. As of 2020, 2019, and 2018 the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for Property & Casualty Other Operations totaled $60, $71 and $105, respectively. Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, particularly for older, long-term casualty liabilities, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required. 

Impact of Re-estimates on Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves

Estimating property and casualty insurance product reserves uses a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. Ultimate losses may vary materially from the current estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels. Prior accident year reserve development is generally due to the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and/or due to changes in interpretations of information and trends.

The table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the past ten years. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves, net of reinsurance. The ranges presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last ten years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability. For further discussion of the potential for variability in recorded loss reserves, see Preferred Reserving Methods by Line of Business and Impact of Key Assumptions on Reserves sections.

For calendar years before 2017, the 2010 and prior accident year development includes adverse development for A&E reserves. Beginning with the 2017 calendar year, A&E reserve development has been ceded to NICO.

The commentary below explains, by accident year, the total prior accident year development recognized over the past 10 years.

Accident years 2010 and Prior

The net increases in estimates of ultimate losses for accident years 2010 and prior are driven mostly by increased reserves for asbestos and environmental reserves, and also by increased estimates for customs bonds, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and other mass torts claims.

Partially offsetting these reserve increases was favorable development in general liability and personal automobile liability.

Accident year 2011

Unfavorable changes in estimates of ultimate losses on accident year 2011 were primarily related to workers' compensation and commercial automobile liability. Workers' compensation loss cost trends were higher than initially expected as an increase in frequency outpaced a moderation of severity trends. Unfavorable commercial automobile liability reserve re-estimates were driven by higher frequency of large loss bodily injury claims.

Accident years 2012 and 2013

Estimates of ultimate losses were decreased for accident years 2012 and 2013 due to favorable frequency and/or medical severity trends for workers’ compensation and favorable professional liability claim emergence. Favorable emergence of property lines of business, including catastrophes, for the 2013 accident year, is partially offset by increased reserves in automobile liability due to increased severity of large claims.

Accident years 2014 and 2015

Changes in estimates of ultimate losses for accident years 2014 and 2015 were largely driven by unfavorable frequency and severity trends for personal and commercial automobile liability, increased severity of liability claims on package business and increased estimated severity on the acquired Navigators Group book of business related to U.S. construction, premises liability, products liability and excess casualty offset by favorable frequency and medical severity trends for workers' compensation.

Accident year 2016

Estimates of ultimate losses were decreased for the 2016 accident year largely due to reserve decreases on short-tail lines of business, where results emerge more quickly, and workers’ compensation due to lower estimated claim severity, somewhat offset by unfavorable reserve estimates for higher hazard general liability exposures due to increased frequency and severity trends, higher estimated severity in middle & large commercial and on the acquired Navigators Group book of business related to U.S. construction, premises liability, products liability and excess casualty.

Accident year 2017

Ultimate loss estimates were decreased for the 2017 accident year mainly due to release of reserves related to catastrophes, lower reserve estimates in personal automobile liability due to emergence of lower estimated severity and lower reserve estimates for workers’ compensation related to lower than previously estimated claim severity , somewhat offset by 

71

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

increases in estimates of ultimate losses in general liability and bond. Partially offsetting was an increase to general liability reserves that was related to high hazard exposures which experienced increased frequency and severity trends. In addition, unfavorable bond reserve re-estimates were driven by large claims. On the Navigators Group book of business, reserve increases for professional liability were related to large syndicate D&O losses.

Accident year 2018

Ultimate loss estimates were decreased for the 2018 accident year mainly due to reduction in estimated catastrophe reserves for California wildfires and for various wind and hail events. Reserve estimates were also reduced, to a lesser extent, for personal automobile liability which decreased due to lower than previously expected claim severity. These reserve decreases were slightly offset by increases in commercial automobile liability, professional liability and general liability. Commercial automobile liability reserve increases were related to higher estimated severity on middle & large commercial. Increases in general liability reserves for middle market and complex liability claims were also largely due to higher than previously expected severity. On the Navigators Group book of business, reserve increases for professional liability were related to large loss activity and increased estimated severity on directors and officers reserves.

Accident year 2019

Ultimate loss estimates were decreased for the 2019 accident year mainly due to favorable emergence of property lines of business, mainly related to catastrophes, slightly offset by increases in commercial automobile liability reserves due to higher than expected large losses in middle & large commercial.

Group Benefit LTD Reserves, Net of Reinsurance

The Company establishes reserves for group life and accident & health contracts, including long-term disability coverage, for both reported claims and claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. As long-term disability reserves are long-tail claim liabilities, they are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The Company held $6,494 and $6,616 of LTD unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

A Disabled Life Reserve ("DLR") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all future benefit payments starting with the known monthly gross benefit which is reduced for estimates of the expected claim recovery due to return to work or claimant death, offsets from other income including offsets from Social Security benefits, and discounting where the discount rate is tied to expected investment yield at the time the claim is incurred. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the 

DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability. In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR. 

The DLR also includes a liability for potential payments to pending claimants beyond the elimination period who have not yet been approved for LTD. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. 

Estimates for incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims are made by applying completion factors to expected emerged experience by line of business. Included within IBNR are bulk reserves for claims reported but still within the waiting period until benefits are paid, typically 3 or 6 months depending on the contract. Completion factors are derived from standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The reserves include an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.

For all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and line of business, where emerged claims for an incurral year are not yet credible enough to be a basis for estimating reserves. In these cases, the ultimate loss is estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio based on pricing assumptions of claim incidence, claim severity, and earned pricing.

Impact of Key Assumptions on Reserves

The key assumptions affecting our group life and accident & health reserves including disability include:

Discount Rate - 

The discount rate is the interest rate at which expected future claim cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. A higher selected discount rate results in a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to cover the discount accretion on our claim reserves which would negatively affect our profits. For each incurral year, the discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned net of investment expenses. The incurral year is the year in which the claim is incurred and the estimated settlement pattern is determined. Once established, discount rates for each incurral year are unchanged except that LTD reserves assumed from the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business are all discounted using rates as of the November 1, 2017 acquisition date. The weighted average discount rate on LTD reserves was 3.4% in 2020 and 2019. Had the discount rate for each incurral year been 10 basis points lower at the time they were established, our LTD unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be higher by $29, pretax, as of December 31, 2020.

Claim Termination Rates (inclusive of mortality, recoveries, and expiration of benefits) - 

Claim termination rates are an estimate of the rate at which claimants will cease receiving benefits during a given calendar year. Terminations result from a number of factors, including death, recoveries and expiration of benefits. The probability that benefits will terminate in each future month

for each claim is estimated using a predictive model that uses past Company experience, contract provisions, job characteristics and other claimant-specific characteristics such as diagnosis, time since disability began, and age. Actual claim termination experience will vary from period to period. Over the past 9 years, claim termination rates for a single incurral year have generally increased and have ranged from 6% below to 7% above current assumptions over that time period. For a single recent incurral year (such as 2020), a one percent decrease in our assumption for LTD claim termination rates would increase our reserves by $9. For all incurral years combined, as of December 31, 2020, a one percent decrease in our assumption for our LTD claim termination rates would increase our Group Benefits unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by $22.

Impact of COVID-19 on 2020 Results of Operations

Within Group Benefits, the Company experienced excess mortality in its group life business of $239 in 2020, primarily caused by direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19. Within the group disability business, in 2020 the Company recognized $29 of COVID-19 direct losses from short-term disability claims, more than offset by $38 of favorable frequency on other short-term disability claims.

Current Trends Contributing to Reserve Uncertainty

We hedge our interest rate exposure over a three year period at the time we price and sell long-term disability policies and our weighted average discount rate assumption for the 2020 incurral year is up slightly from that of the 2019 incurral year.

While we have not seen a significant change in claim recovery patterns to date, in future periods, because of COVID-19, we could experience a delay in the Social Security Administration’s processing of disability claims and a delay in physicians approving a disability claimant’s ability to return to work, resulting in lower expected claim terminations or recoveries, including Social Security offsets. Also, due to the effects on the economy, including higher unemployment, we could experience an increase in claim incidence on long-term disability claims.

Evaluation of Goodwill for Impairment

Goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted updated accounting guidance on recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment, as required. The updated guidance requires recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment based on the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its estimated fair value, up to the amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. 

The estimated fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital, future business growth, earnings projections, assets under management for Hartford Funds and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in business 

growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairment.

A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated consist of Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds.

The carrying value of goodwill was $1,911 as of December 31, 2020 and was comprised of $659 for Commercial Lines, $119 for Personal Lines, $861 for Group Benefits, and $272 for Hartford Funds.

The annual goodwill assessment for the reporting units was completed as of October 31, 2020, and resulted in no write-downs of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020. All reporting units passed the annual impairment test with a significant margin. For information regarding the 2019 and 2018 impairment tests see Note 11 - Goodwill & Other Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Due to the continuing impacts in the economy because of the COVID-19 pandemic, near-term expected net cash flows over the forecast period reflect estimated COVID-19 claims and economic effects of the pandemic. Considering the impacts of COVID-19, if the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting increases significantly or if the economic downturn worsens or persists for an extended period and the Company's actual and forecasted operating results deteriorate, the Company may determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is below its carrying value, including goodwill, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments 

Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments, and Derivatives

The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing services, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. The fair value of derivative instruments are determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses ("OTC-cleared") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. For further discussion, see the Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Derivatives section in Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Evaluation of Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and ACL on Mortgage Loans

Each quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if a credit loss is present for fixed maturities, AFS or an ACL is required for mortgage loans. This evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of the accounting policies, see the Significant Investment Accounting Policies Section in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of credit losses recorded, see the Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments and ACL on Mortgage Loans sections within the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of the MD&A.

Contingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters

Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” 

or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.

The Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the Company. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Upon acquisition of Navigators Group and a review of Navigators Insurers reserves, the year ended December 31, 2019 included $68 of prior accident year reserve increases and $29 of current accident year reserve increases which were excluded for the purposes of the underlying combined ratio calculation.

2021 Outlook

The Company expects higher Commercial Lines written premiums in 2021, with growth across small commercial, middle & large commercial, and global specialty. In small commercial, policy retention is expected to remain strong with new business growth across all lines of business. Assuming the economy recovers with the rollout of vaccines, we expect an increase in insured exposures, including from higher payrolls on workers’ compensation policies. In middle & large commercial, assuming a continued economic recovery, we expect written premium 

growth in our general industries book of business driven by new business growth and an increase in insured exposures and that we will generate new business growth in specialized industries as well as with large and complex solutions. In global specialty, premium growth in 2021 is expected primarily in wholesale and financial lines benefiting from written pricing increases. 

In 2021, management expects positive renewal written pricing in all lines of business except workers' compensation, with workers' compensation pricing expected to be flat to slightly positive in middle market and down in small commercial. In small commercial

and middle & large commercial, high-single digit rate increases are expected to continue in commercial auto, general liability and property. In global specialty, in 2021, we expect written pricing increases in the high teens in international, low double-digits in wholesale and high single digits in US financial lines. Written pricing increases in 2021 in lines other than workers’ compensation are driven by a number of factors including the effects of social inflation, increased catastrophe losses due to changing weather patterns, and a prolonged low interest rate environment, that puts added pressure on the need for underwriting profits to make up for the lost investment yield. 

The Company expects the Commercial Lines combined ratio will be between approximately 93.5 and 95.5 for 2021, compared to 100.4 in 2020, primarily due to lower current accident year catastrophe losses expected in 2021 and lower COVID-19 incurred claims. The underlying combined ratio is expected to be lower as fewer COVID-19 claims are expected in 2021 as we emerge from the pandemic. Apart from lower expected COVID-19 claims, earned pricing increases in excess of moderate increases in loss costs in most lines will be partially offset by continued margin compression in small commercial workers’ compensation, while the expense ratio is expected to improve by nearly a point. Current accident year catastrophes are assumed to be 3.1 points of the combined ratio in 2021 compared to 4.5 points in 2020.

Net Income 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Net income 

decreased primarily due to a change from an underwriting gain in 2019 to an underwriting loss in 2020 and a change from net realized capital gains in 2019 to net realized capital losses in 2020, partially offset by higher net investment income. Also partially offsetting the decline in net income was $91 before tax of ADC ceded premium in the prior year period. For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results.

Underwriting Gain (Loss) 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Underwriting loss 

in 2020 compared with an underwriting gain in 2019 with the underwriting loss in 2020 primarily due to COVID-19 incurred losses in property, workers’ compensation and financial and other lines, higher current accident year catastrophes, a change from net favorable prior accident year development in 2019 to net unfavorable prior accident year development in 2020 and the effect of lower earned premiums excluding the effect of the Navigators acquisition. Underwriting expenses were down slightly as a decrease in incentive compensation, benefits costs, commissions and travel costs were largely offset by the inclusion of Navigators for a full twelve months in 2020, an increase in the ACL on premiums receivable in 2020 due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 and the effect of a reduction in state taxes and assessments in 2019. In 2020, the acquisition of Navigators Group contributed to an increase in earned premiums with a corresponding increase to losses and loss adjustment expenses, amortization of DAC and underwriting expenses.

Earned Premiums

[1]

Other of $43, $42, and $45 for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, is included in the total.

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Earned premiums

 increased in 2020 with the increase in reflecting a full twelve months of premium from the acquisition of Navigators Group. Excluding Navigators, earned premiums declined in 2020, with decreases in both small commercial and in middle & large commercial.

Written premiums

 increased in 2020 with the growth attributable to the acquisition of Navigators Group. Excluding Navigators, written premiums declined in 2020 due to the economic impacts of COVID-19, including lower new business across most lines as well as reductions in estimated audit premiums and endorsements reducing premium in workers’ compensation due to a declining exposure base, partially offset by continued written pricing increases in all lines except workers' compensation.

In small commercial, renewal written price increases were slightly higher in 2020 than 2019, with mid-single digit to high single-digit rate increases in most lines, largely offset by written pricing decreases in workers’ compensation. In middle market, higher written pricing increases in 2020 were mostly due to double digit rate increases in middle market automobile and specialty excess liability lines and mid-single digit to high single-digit rate increases in most other middle market lines. In global specialty, our US wholesale book achieved an approximate 25% renewal written price increase, led by excess casualty, property and 

automobile. The international lines also achieved strong price increases, led by D&O.

New business premium decreased in 2020 in most lines driven by lower quote volume due to the economic effects of COVID-19 and a competitive pricing environment, though to a lesser extent in the second half of 2020. Also contributing to the decrease in new business in small commercial was the effect of new business from the 2018 Foremost renewal rights agreement in 2019.

•

Small commercial written premium declined in 2020 driven by a decrease in workers compensation, partially offset by growth in package business.

•

Middle & large commercial written premium decreased in 2020 driven by lower new business and premium retention across all lines, partially offset by the acquisition of Navigators Group. Middle & large commercial premium decreases in 2020 were primarily driven by declines in general industries, driven by underwriting actions to improve the profitability of that book, as well as in industry verticals and national accounts, partially offset by growth in specialty and commercial excess lines.

•

Global specialty written premium increased in 2020 with the increase driven by the acquisition of Navigators Group. Apart from Navigators Group, written premium decreased slightly in 2020 due to a decline in wholesale and bond business, partially offset by growth in professional liability.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Current Accident Year Loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes

 increased in 2020, primarily due to COVID-19 incurred losses, net of favorable non-COVID-19 workers' compensation frequency as well as a slightly higher loss ratio in small commercial workers' compensation, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe property losses and margin improvement in the Navigators book, primarily in wholesale and global re. 

2020 included COVID-19 incurred losses of $278 before tax, including losses of $141 in property, $66 in workers’ compensation, net of favorable frequency on other workers' compensation claims, and $71 in financial and other lines.

Included in the $141 of COVID-19 property incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 were $101 of losses arising from a small number of property policies that do not require direct physical loss or damage and from policies intended to cover specific business needs, including crisis management and performance disruption. In addition, we recorded a reserve of $40 for legal defense costs in 2020. Workers’ compensation COVID-19 incurred losses in 2020 were driven by claims in both states with presumptive coverage and in other states where the claimant must prove their COVID-19 illness was contracted at work. Financial lines COVID-19 claims in 2020 were primarily driven by exposures in D&O, E&O and employment practices liability and the recessionary impacts on the surety book of business.

Catastrophes and Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Accident Year Development 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 

Current accident year catastrophe losses

 

for 2020 were primarily from civil unrest, a number of hurricanes and tropical storms, Pacific Coast wildfires, and Northeast windstorms as well as tornado, wind and hail events in the South, Midwest and Central Plains. Catastrophe losses for 2019 were primarily from tornado, wind and hail events in various areas of the Midwest, Mountain West and Southeast and, to a lesser extent, winter storms in the northern plains, Midwest and Northeast.

Prior accident year development 

was a net unfavorable $44 before tax in 2020 compared to a net favorable $44 before tax in the comparable 2019 period. Net unfavorable reserve development for 2020 included reserve increases for general liability driven primarily by increases in reserves for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims, and increases in commercial automobile liability reserves, partially offset by net reserve decreases for catastrophes, workers' compensation and package business. Favorable development on prior year catastrophe reserves in 2020 was due to recognizing a $29 before tax subrogation benefit from a settlement with PG&E over certain of the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and a reduction in estimated catastrophe losses from a number of wind and hail events that occurred in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Prior accident year development in 2020 also included $102 of reserve increases related to Navigators Group on 2018 and prior accident years that was economically ceded to NICO but for which the benefit was not recognized in earnings as it has been recorded as a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance. Net reserve decreases for 2019 were primarily related to lower loss reserve estimates for workers' compensation claims, package business reserves and catastrophes, partially offset by a $68 before tax increase to Navigators Group reserves upon acquisition of the business and increases in reserves for automobile liability and general liability. The increase in Navigators Group reserves upon acquisition of the business principally related to higher reserve estimates for general liability, professional liability and marine.

2021 Outlook

Written premium is expected to be relatively flat in 2021 compared with 2020 despite $81 of premium credits issued in 2020 as non-renewal of premium more than offsets new business. While new business conversions are expected to increase, new business premium is expected to be relatively flat as the Company begins to transition from 12-month automobile policies to 6-month automobile policies for AARP members as we roll out our new automobile and homeowners products in certain states.

In 2021, the Company expects written pricing increases in 2021 to be in the low single digits for automobile and high-single digits for homeowners. Rate increases in automobile will likely continue to moderate as lower claim frequency due to shelter-in-place guidelines during the pandemic is reflected in rate filings.

 

The Company expects the combined ratio for Personal Lines will be between approximately 94.0 and 96.0 for 2021 compared to 75.5 in 2020 as 2020 benefited from lower claim frequency due to fewer miles driven as a result of the pandemic as well as from favorable prior accident year development. The underlying combined ratio for Personal Lines is expected to be higher due to an increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes in both automobile and homeowners. Current accident year catastrophes are assumed to be 7.2 points of the combined ratio in 2021 compared with 6.9 points in 2020. For automobile, we expect the underlying combined ratio to increase as automobile claim frequency rises again as we emerge from the pandemic. The underlying combined ratio for homeowners is also expected to increase in 2021, primarily driven by a return to a higher, more normal, level of non-catastrophe weather loss experience, partially offset by the effect of earned pricing increases.

Net Income (Loss) 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 

Net income 

increased by $400, primarily due to favorable prior accident year catastrophe reserve development in the 2020 period, lower non-catastrophe current accident year losses in automobile and homeowners, and lower underwriting expenses, partially offset by an increase in current accident year catastrophes, a reduction in earned premium, including the effect of $81 in premium credits given to automobile policyholders in the second quarter of 2020, a change to net realized capital losses in the 2020 period and lower net investment income.

Underwriting Gain (Loss) 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Underwriting gain 

in 2020 increased primarily due to favorable prior accident year development in the 2020 period driven by a reduction in prior year catastrophe reserves, lower current accident year losses in automobile due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a reduction in non-catastrophe weather losses in homeowners, and lower underwriting expenses, partially offset by a reduction in earned premium, including the effect of $81 in premium credits given to automobile policyholders in the second quarter of 2020.

Earned Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 

Earned premiums

 decreased in 2020, reflecting a decline in written premium over the prior twelve months in both Agency and in AARP Direct and, the effect of $81 of premium credits given to automobile policyholders in the second quarter of 2020 in recognition of shelter-in-place guidelines that have resulted in a decline in miles driven.

82

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Written premiums

 decreased in 2020 in AARP Direct and Agency. For automobile, written premium in 2020 included a reduction for the $81 of premium credits given to policyholders in the second quarter. Written premium for both automobile and homeowners declined as the amount of non-renewed premium exceeded the new business premium. New business increased slightly in automobile and declined in homeowners.

Renewal written pricing

 increases were lower in 2020 in automobile in response to moderating loss cost trends. For homeowners, while written pricing increases had moderated during the first half of 2020, written pricing increases were higher in the second half of 2020 due to the rate need arising from catastrophe and other property claims experience.

Policy count retention

 increased for both automobile and homeowners reflecting the effect of moderating renewal written price increases during all of 2020 for automobile and during the first six months of 2020 for homeowners.

Premium retention

 for automobile decreased in 2020 mostly due to the $81 of automobile premium credits given to policyholders in the second quarter of 2020. Premium retention for homeowners improved in 2020 driven by renewal rate increases, partially offset by a decline in policy count retention in the second half of 2020.

Policies in-force

 decreased in 2020 in both automobile and homeowners, driven by not generating enough new business to offset the loss of non-renewed policies.

Current Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio before Catastrophes

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Current accident year loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes

 decreased in 2020 in both automobile and homeowners. For automobile, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio benefited from earned pricing increases and from lower claim frequency, primarily driven by shelter-in-place guidelines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For homeowners, the primary driver was fewer non-catastrophe weather claims.

Current Accident Year Catastrophes and Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Accident Year Development

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Current accident year catastrophe losses

 for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily from a number of hurricanes and tropical storms, Pacific Coast wildfires and Northeast windstorms as well as tornado, wind and hail events in the South, Midwest and Central Plains. Catastrophe losses for 2019 primarily included winter storms across the country and tornado, wind and hail events in the South, Midwest, and Mountain West.

Prior accident year development

 was favorable in 2020, principally due to a reduction in catastrophe loss reserves and, to a lesser extent, lower than previously expected AARP Direct automobile liability claim severity for the 2017 to 2019 accident years. The reduction in catastrophe loss reserves was 

83

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

driven by lower estimated losses for the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires, including a $260 subrogation benefit from PG&E, as well as a reduction in losses for various 2017, 2018 and 2019 wind and hail events. Prior accident year development was 

favorable in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in automobile liability reserves for the 2017 accident year.

Net Income (Loss) 

 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

 

Net loss

 in 2020 changed from net income in 2019, primarily due to an increase in net unfavorable prior accident year development, a decrease in net investment income and a change from net realized capital gains to net realized capital losses.

Unfavorable prior accident year development in 2020 primarily included a $208 charge for increases in A&E reserves and a $35 increase in ULAE reserves which was largely driven by the higher estimate for A&E claims. Before NICO reinsurance, A&E reserves were increased by $236 in P&C Other Operations, including $130 for asbestos and $106 for environmental. Cumulative adverse A&E reserve development on both ongoing operations and P&C Other Operations totaled $860 through December 31, 2020 and since this amount exceeds ceded premium paid for the A&E ADC of $650, the Company recognized a $210 deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance in 2020, all recognized within P&C Other Operations.

Asbestos Reserves 

prior accident year development in 2020 before NICO reinsurance of $130 was primarily due to a higher rate of claim settlements, particularly with certain larger, national defendants, higher than expected average settlement values and defense costs, and an increase in the Company's 

84

Table of Contents

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

estimated share of liability under pending or potential cost sharing agreements and settlements.

Environmental Reserves 

prior accident year development in 2020 before NICO reinsurance of $106 was 

primarily due to an increasing number of claims and suits alleging contamination from or exposure to per & polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"), and increased defense and cleanup costs associated with Superfund sites.

2021 Outlook

The Company expects Group Benefits fully insured ongoing premiums to increase modestly in 2021 due to modestly higher book persistency and continued strong sales which is expected to offset continued lagging employment levels as a result of the pandemic. In 2021, the segment's net income margin is expected to be between 3.5% and 4.5%, compared to a net income margin of 6.4% in 2020. The expected decrease in net income margin largely reflects downward pressure on pricing due to recent historical favorable claim incidence, an expectation of less favorable claim incidence and recoveries on long-term disability claims in 2021 and lower expected investment yields, partially offset by an expectation of lower excess mortality caused by COVID-19 though that is subject to significant uncertainty. The expected net income margin of 3.5% to 4.5% assumes excess mortality of $160 before tax, largely in the first half of 2021 with the most significant portion in the first quarter of 2021. Margins on long-term disability business are expected to decline as the favorable long-term disability loss trends begin to reverse due to economic factors and as price competition intensifies, partly driven by customer behavior to seek multiple bids for renewal. Margins on group life business in 2021 will largely depend on how long COVID-19 infections continue in 2021 pending the timing of distribution and citizen acceptance of vaccines. Management expects that the 2021 core earnings margin, which does not include the effect of net realized capital gains (losses) or integration costs associated with the acquired business, will be in the range of 3.7% to 4.7%, down from a 2020 core earnings margin of 6.4%. 

Net Income 

 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Net income 

decreased primarily due to higher mortality in group life, and, to a lesser extent, lower net investment income, and lower net realized capital gains, partially offset by modestly higher recoveries and lower claim incidence on group disability claims. The increased mortality in group life included $239 of claims deemed to be excess mortality due to direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19. Lower net investment income was primarily driven by lower reinvestment rates and, to a lesser extent, lower income from limited partnership and other alternative investments.

Insurance operating costs and other expenses 

were relatively flat in 2020 as higher information technology ("IT") and other costs related to improving the customer experience were largely offset by lower incentive compensation, employee benefits, travel costs, and lower integration costs.

Fully Insured Ongoing Premiums

 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

 

Fully insured ongoing premiums

 decreased in 2020 with a decrease in both group disability and group life with the declines resulting primarily from lower insured exposure on in-force policies. Premiums for voluntary business increased primarily due to strong sales and persistency. 

Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts

 increased in 2020 with increases in both group disability and group life.

Ratios

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

 

Total loss ratio

 increased 2.2 points in 2020 reflecting a higher group life loss ratio, partially offset by a lower group disability loss ratio. The group life loss ratio increased 8.0 points primarily due to a higher current incurral year loss ratio driven by higher mortality, including $239 of excess mortality due to the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19. Prior incurral year development for group life was more favorable due to favorable mortality emergence on the prior incurral year recognized in the three month period ended March 31, 2020, partially offset by the reserve assumption update related to late reported death claims. The group disability loss ratio decreased 1.2 points with a 0.6 point improvement in the current incurral year loss ratio and 0.3 points of more favorable prior incurral year development. The current incurral year group disability loss ratio improved 0.6 points as lower claim incidence more than offset 1.0 points ($29) of COVID-19 short-term disability and New York Paid Family Leave claims. The more favorable prior incurral year development in group disability was driven by higher claim recoveries and continued improving claim incidence, partially offset by the favorable impacts in 2019 from the long term disability reserve assumption update. 

Expense ratio

 increased 0.7 points in 2020. The expense ratio increased largely due to the decline in premiums and other considerations as higher IT and other costs related to improving the customer experience was largely offset by lower incentive compensation, employee benefits, and travel costs.

2021 Outlook

Assuming continued growth in equity markets in 2021, the Company expects net income for Hartford Funds to increase from 2020 to 2021. From its diversified lineup of mutual funds and ETFs, the Company expects strong sales, though net flows are more uncertain given market volatility and historical redemption rates.

Net Income 

 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 

Net income

 increased primarily due to lower operating costs and other expenses driven by a $12 before tax decrease in Lattice contingent consideration in 2020, a $7 before tax increase in Lattice contingent consideration in 2019 and a reduction in travel 

costs. Fee income and other revenues decreased slightly as the effect of a continued shift to lower fee generating assets was largely offset by higher daily average assets under management. See Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Lattice contingent consideration.

Hartford Funds AUM

 

December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 

Hartford Funds AUM 

increased compared to the prior

year due to an increase in market values, partially offset by net outflows, along with the continued runoff of AUM related to the Talcott Resolution life and annuity separate account AUM.

Net Income (Loss) 

 

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

 

Net loss

 increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to restructuring costs of $104 before tax, lower net investment 

income, lower transition services revenue, and lower income from the Company's retained equity interest in the former life and annuity operations, partially offset by a $90 before tax loss on extinguishment of debt in 2019, transaction costs incurred in 2019 in connection with the acquisition of Navigators Group and lower interest expense. 

Income before tax from the Company's retained equity interest in the former life and annuity operations was $42 and $66 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net investment income was lower in 2020 than 2019 primarily due to a lower yield on short-term investments as well as lower asset levels.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company’s Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in our Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of the Company’s risks.

The Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee (“ERCC”) oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. As illustrated below, a number of functional committees sit underneath the ERCC, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ERCC. 

ERCC Members

CEO (Chair)

President

Chief Financial Officer

Chief Investment Officer

Chief Risk Officer

Chief Underwriting Officer

General Counsel

Others as deemed necessary by the Committee Chair

ERCC

Asset Liability Committee

Underwriting Risk Committee

Emerging Risk Steering Committee

Operational Risk Committee

Economic Capital Executive Committee

Model Oversight Committee

The Company's enterprise risk management ("ERM") function supports the ERCC and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:

•

risk identification and assessment;

•

the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits;

•

risk monitoring; and

•

internal and external risk reporting.

The Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk, each of which is described in more detail below.

Insurance Risk

Insurance risk is the risk of losses of both a catastrophic and non-catastrophic nature on the P&C and Group Benefits products the Company has sold. Catastrophe insurance risk is the exposure arising from both natural (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, pandemics) and man-made catastrophes (e.g., terrorism, cyber-attacks) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios.

91

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Sources of Insurance Risk 

Non-catastrophe insurance risks exist within each of the Company's segments except Hartford Funds and include:

•

Property-

 Risk of loss to personal or commercial property from automobile related accidents, weather, explosions, smoke, shaking, fire, theft, vandalism, inadequate installation, faulty equipment, collisions and falling objects, and/or machinery mechanical breakdown resulting in physical damage and other covered perils.

•

Liability-

 Risk of loss from automobile related accidents, uninsured and underinsured drivers, lawsuits from accidents, defective products, breach of warranty, negligent acts by professional practitioners, environmental claims, latent exposures, fraud, coercion, forgery, failure to fulfill obligations per contract surety, liability from errors and omissions, losses from political and credit coverages, losses from derivative lawsuits, and other securities actions and covered perils.

•

Mortality-

 Risk of loss from unexpected trends in insured deaths impacting timing of payouts from group life insurance, personal or commercial automobile related accidents, and death of employees or executives during the course of employment, while on disability, or while collecting workers compensation benefits.

•

Morbidity-

 Risk of loss to an insured from illness incurred during the course of employment or illness from other covered perils.

•

Disability-

 Risk of loss incurred from personal or commercial automobile related losses, accidents arising outside of the workplace, injuries or accidents incurred during the course of employment, or from equipment, with each loss resulting in short term or long-term disability payments.

•

Longevity-

 Risk of loss from increased life expectancy trends among policyholders receiving long-term benefit payments.

•

Cyber Insurance

- Risk of loss to property, breach of data and business interruption from various types of cyber-attacks. 

Catastrophe risk primarily arises in the property, automobile, workers' compensation, casualty, group life, and group disability lines of business. Not all insurance losses arising from catastrophe 

risk are categorized as catastrophe losses within the segment operating results. For example, losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic were not categorized as catastrophe losses within either the P&C or Group Benefits segments as the pandemic was not identified as a catastrophe event by the Property Claim Service in the U.S. See the term Current Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio within the Key Performance Measures section of MD&A for an explanation of how the Company defines catastrophe losses in its financial reporting.

Impact 

Non-catastrophe insurance risk can arise from unexpected loss experience, underpriced business and/or underestimation of loss reserves and can have significant effects on the Company’s earnings. Catastrophe insurance risk can arise from various unpredictable events and can have significant effects on the Company's earnings and may result in losses that could constrain its liquidity.

Management 

The Company's policies and procedures for managing these risks include disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk-based pricing, risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. The Company has established underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and risks in the aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. The Company uses both internal and third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the Company's financial position and results of operations across its businesses. 

In addition, certain insurance products offered by The Hartford provide coverage for losses incurred due to cyber events and the Company has assessed and modeled how those products would respond to different events in order to manage its aggregate exposure to losses incurred under the insurance policies we sell. The Company models numerous deterministic scenarios including losses caused by malware, data breach, distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of cloud environments and attacks of power grids. 

Among specific risk tolerances set by the Company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk.

Risk

Definition

Details and Company Limits

Natural catastrophe

Exposure arising from natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, etc.) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios and the inherent volatility of weather or climate pattern changes. 

The Company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss as a result of natural catastrophes for property & casualty exposures from a single 250-year event to less than 30% of the reported capital and surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to reinsurance and to less than 15% of the reported capital and surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries after reinsurance. From time to time the estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures or statutory surplus. [2]

 - The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum loss from earthquake events is estimated to be $1.2 billion before reinsurance and $0.6 billion net of reinsurance. [1]

 - The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum losses from hurricane events are estimated to be $1.8 billion before reinsurance and $0.9 billion net of reinsurance. [1]

Terrorism

The risk of losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by single-site and multi-site conventional attacks, as well as the potential for attacks using nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons (“NBCR”). 

Enterprise limits for terrorism apply to aggregations of risk across property-casualty, group benefits and specific asset portfolios and are defined based on a deterministic, single-site conventional terrorism attack scenario. The Company manages its potential estimated loss from a conventional terrorism loss scenario, up to $2.0 billion net of reinsurance and $2.5 billion gross of reinsurance, before coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program established under “TRIPRA”. In addition, the Company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline. Our modeled exposures to conventional terrorist attacks around landmark locations may fluctuate above and below our stated limits.

Pandemic

The exposure to loss arising from widespread influenza or other pathogens or bacterial infections that create an aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios. 

The Company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss from a single 250 year pandemic event to less than 18% of the aggregate reported capital and surplus of the property and casualty and group benefits insurance subsidiaries. In evaluating these scenarios, the Company assesses the impact on group life, short-term disability, long-term disability and property & casualty claims. While ERM has a process to track and manage these limits, from time to time, the estimated loss for pandemics may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus. In addition, the Company assesses losses in the investment portfolio associated with market declines in the event of a widespread pandemic. [2]

[1]

The loss estimates represent total property losses for hurricane events and property and workers compensation losses for earthquake events resulting from a single event. The estimates provided are based on 250-year return period loss estimates that have a 0.4% likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. The net loss estimates provided assume that the Company is able to recover all losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. The Company also manages natural catastrophe risk for group life and group disability, which in combination with property and workers compensation loss estimates are subject to separate enterprise risk management net aggregate loss limits as a percent of enterprise surplus.

[2]

For U.S. insurance subsidiaries, reported capital and surplus is equal to actual U.S. statutory capital and surplus. For Navigators Insurers in non-U.S. jurisdictions, reported capital and surplus is equal to U.S. GAAP equity of those subsidiaries less certain assets such as goodwill and intangible assets.

Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy

The Company uses reinsurance to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company's risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that reinsure property and workers' compensation exposures, and individual risk (including facultative reinsurance) or quota share arrangements, that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The Company has no significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (“TRIPRA”) and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.

Reinsurance for Catastrophes-

 

The Company utilizes various reinsurance programs to mitigate catastrophe losses including excess of loss occurrence-based treaties covering property and workers’ compensation, and an aggregate property catastrophe treaty. The aggregate property catastrophe treaty covers the 

aggregate of catastrophe events designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk and, for international business, net losses arising from two or more risks involved in the same loss occurrence totaling at least $500 thousand, in excess of a $700 retention. The occurrence-based property catastrophe treaties respond in excess of $100 per occurrence for all perils other than named storm and earthquake (subject to a $50 annual aggregate deductible). Our per occurrence property catastrophe treaties and workers’ compensation catastrophe treaty incepting January 1, 2020 did not exclude pandemic losses from coverage and did not require a pandemic to be designated as a catastrophe event by PCS for coverage. Accordingly, we would have the opportunity for recovery if COVID-19 related losses were to exceed the retentions and fall within the terms and conditions of the contracts, including that losses are sustained by the Company during a defined period of time, commonly referred to as an hours clause. Based on current estimates of ultimate incurred losses from the pandemic, we have not booked a recovery under our per occurrence property or workers’ compensation catastrophe treaties. Our aggregate property catastrophe program requires a PCS catastrophe designation for events in the U.S. and since the pandemic has not been designated a PCS event, COVID-19 losses would not be covered by the aggregate program. In addition to 

93

Table of Contents

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

catastrophe reinsurance, the Company has per risk and quota share reinsurance that would respond to certain COVID-19 related losses. The reinsurance market has shifted to require communicable disease exclusions and, as such, our per occurrence property catastrophe treaty and workers’ compensation catastrophe treaty incepting January 1, 2021 do not cover pandemic losses. The Company has reinsurance in place to cover individual group life losses in excess of $1 per person. With respect to civil unrest, losses relating to civil unrest that in 

2020 was designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk as a catastrophe event will cede to our property catastrophe aggregate cover. Such losses are not expected to be covered by the property catastrophe occurrence treaties because the unrest occurred in non-contiguous areas though the Company has property per risk and property quota share reinsurance that would cover certain losses related to the civil unrest. For our property catastrophe treaty incepting January 1, 2021, losses from most cyber events are not covered.

 These treaties do not cover the assumed reinsurance business which purchases its own retrocessional coverage.

[2]

In addition to the Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty, for Florida wind events, The Hartford has purchased the mandatory FHCF reinsurance for the annual period starting at June 1, 2020. Retention and coverage varies by writing company. The writing company with the largest coverage under FHCF is Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest, with coverage estimated at approximately $55 of per event losses in excess of a $24 retention (estimates are based on best available information at this time and are periodically updated as information is made available by Florida). 

[3]

Portions of this layer of coverage extend beyond a traditional one year term.

[4]

The aggregate treaty is not limited to a single event; rather, it is designed to provide reinsurance protection for the aggregate of all catastrophe events (up to $350 per event), either designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk or, for international business, net losses arising from two or more risks involved in the same loss occurrence totaling at least $500 thousand. All catastrophe losses apply toward satisfying the $700 attachment point under the aggregate treaty.

[5]

In addition to the limits shown, the workers' compensation reinsurance includes a non-catastrophe, industrial accident layer, providing coverage for 80% of $30 in per event losses in excess of a $20 retention.

[6]

Named hurricanes and tropical storms are defined as any storm or storm system declared to be a hurricane or tropical storm by the US National Hurricane Center, US Weather Prediction Center, or their successor organizations (being divisions of the US National Weather Service).

 

In addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the Company has other reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses. The Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty, and Workers' Compensation Catastrophe Treaty include a provision to reinstate one limit in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties. 

Reinsurance for Terrorism-

 For the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As such, the Company's principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA to the end of 2027.

TRIPRA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism”, which is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, for losses that exceed a threshold of industry losses of $200. Under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government will pay a percentage of losses incurred from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer's losses exceed 20% of the Company's eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. The percentage of losses paid by the federal government is 80% . The Company's estimated deductible under the program is $1.6 billion for 2021. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.

Reinsurance for A&E and Navigators Group Reserve Development -

 The Company has two adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. One agreement covers substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years (the “A&E ADC”) and the other covers substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance 

Company and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (“Navigators ADC”). For more information on the A&E ADC and the Navigators ADC, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reinsurance Recoverables

Property and Casualty insurance product reinsurance

 

recoverables represent loss and loss adjustment expense recoverables from a number of entities, including reinsurers and pools. A portion of the total gross reinsurance recoverables balance relates to the Company’s participation in various mandatory (assigned) and involuntary risk pools and the value of annuity contracts held under structured settlement agreements.

Group Benefits and Corporate reinsurance recoverables

 

represent reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other policyholder funds and benefits payable that are recoverable from a number of reinsurers. 

The table below shows the gross and net reinsurance recoverables reported in the Property and Casualty and Group Benefits reporting segments as well as Corporate. 

To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer.

In placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating. Where its 

contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral or other credit enhancement, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. For further discussion on reinsurance recoverables, including details of recoverables by AM Best credit rating, see Note 9 – Reinsurance of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Annually, the Company completes evaluations of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Property & Casualty Other Operations and Group Benefits reporting segments as well as recoverables in Corporate, and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reported in the Commercial Lines reporting segment. For a discussion regarding the results of these evaluations, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance and Group Benefit LTD Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-related Assessments

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company regularly monitors the financial strength of other insurers and, in particular, activity by insurance regulators and various state guaranty associations in the U.S. relating to troubled insurers. In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events.

Sources of Operational Risk

 

Operational risk is inherent in the Company's business and functional areas. Operational risks include: compliance with laws and regulation, cybersecurity, business disruption, technology failure, inadequate execution or process management, reliance on model and data analytics, internal fraud, external fraud, third party dependency and attraction and retention of talent.

Impact

 Operational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.

Management

 Responsibility for day-to-day management of operational risk lies within each business unit and functional area. ERM provides an enterprise-wide view of the Company's operational risk on an aggregate basis. ERM is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the Company's operational risk management program. Operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

•

Establishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;

•

Conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;

•

Validating existing crisis management protocols;

•

Identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and

•

Purchasing insurance coverage.

In response to COVID-19 the Company has implemented a number of mitigation strategies to address potential operational impacts, including:

•

Activated our cross-functional Crisis Management Team ("CMT") comprising representatives from areas such as the Business Resiliency Office, IT, Corporate Health & Well-being, Employee Relations, Security, Facilities and Communications ;

•

Enabled the vast majority of employees to work from home with no material impacts to operations; for employees in the office, various protocols have been implemented to promote employee health and safety including, but not limited to, the use of personal protective equipment, practicing social distancing and enhanced cleaning;

•

Strengthened technology infrastructure and expanded policies for accessing the Company’s network remotely; 

•

Actively worked with sourcing partners to ensure they were implementing their business continuity plans; and

•

Provided support to employees through our Corporate, Health & Well-being team composed of healthcare professionals to identify and isolate employees with potential COVID-19 exposure.

Cybersecurity Risk

The Hartford has implemented an information protection program with established governance routines that promote an adaptive approach for assessing and managing risks. The Hartford employs a ‘defense-in-depth’ strategy that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of the Company's information assets. This ‘defense-in-depth’ strategy aligns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective and responsive measures that collectively protects the Company. Various cyber assurance methods, including security metrics, third party security assessments, external penetration testing, red team exercises, and cyber war game exercises are used to test the effectiveness of the overall cybersecurity control environment.

The Hartford, like many other large financial services companies, blocks attempted cyber intrusions on a daily basis. In the event of a cyber intrusion, the Company invokes its Cyber Incident Response Program (the "Program") commensurate with the nature of the intrusion. While the actual methods employed differ based on the event, our approach uses internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts and requires elevation of issues, as necessary, to senior management. In addition, we have procedures to ensure timely notification of critical cybersecurity incidents pursuant to the Program to help identify employees who may have material non-public information and to implement blackout restrictions on 

trading the Company's securities during the investigation and assessment of such cybersecurity incidents.

From a governance perspective, senior members of our Enterprise Risk Management, Information Protection and Internal Audit functions provided detailed, regular reports on cybersecurity matters in 2020 to the Board, including the Finance, Investment, and Risk Management Committee ("FIRMCo"), a committee consisting of all directors and the Audit Committee, which oversees controls for the Company's major risk exposures, and has principal responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk. The topics covered by these updates include the Company's activities, policies and procedures to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned from cybersecurity incidents and internal and external testing of our cyber defenses.

Financial Risk

Financial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives from events that impact financial market conditions and the value of financial assets. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's invested assets. 

Consistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored and managed, with risks mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including limiting aggregation of risk, portfolio re-balancing and hedging with over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives are utilized to achieve the following Company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; and engaging in income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management. The Company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity and foreign currency exchange.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due.

Sources of Liquidity Risk 

Sources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.

Impact

 

Inadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management

 The Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquid assets among legal entities. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact operating cash flows or liquid assets. The liquidity requirements of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("HFSG Holding Company") have been and will continue to be met by the HFSG Holding Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from its subsidiaries, principally its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities as needed. The Company maintains multiple sources of contingent liquidity including a revolving credit facility, an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates, and access to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ("FHLBB") for certain affiliates. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.

Refer to the Capital Resources & Liquidity section of MD&A for the discussion of what the Company is doing to manage liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk

Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spreads.

Sources of Credit Risk

 

The majority of the Company’s credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings and use of derivatives, but it is also present in the Company’s ceded reinsurance activities and various insurance products.

Impact

 A decline in creditworthiness is typically reflected as an increase in an investment’s credit spread and an associated decline in the investment's fair value, potentially resulting in recording an ACL and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. In certain instances, counterparties may default on their obligations and the Company may realize a loss on default. Premiums receivable, including premiums for retrospectively rated plans, reinsurance recoverable and deductible losses recoverable are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty’s unwillingness or inability to pay.

For a discussion of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity section of this MD&A.

Management

 The objective of the Company’s enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk in aggregate and to limit potential losses in accordance with the Company's credit risk management policy. The Company manages its credit risk by managing aggregations of risk, holding a diversified mix of issuers and counterparties 

across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios and limiting exposure to any specific reinsurer or counterparty. Potential credit losses can be mitigated through diversification (e.g., geographic regions, asset types, industry sectors), hedging and the use of collateral to reduce net credit exposure.

The Company manages credit risk through the use of various surveillance, analyses and governance processes. The investment, derivatives and reinsurance areas have formal policies and procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish criteria defining minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability for eligible counterparties. Potential investments are subject to underwriting reviews and private securities are also subject to management approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:

•

Investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities; 

•

Selling investments subject to credit risk;

•

Hedging through use of credit default swaps;

•

Clearing derivative transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;

•

Entering into derivative and reinsurance contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions

•

Requiring collateral; and

•

Non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.

The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives. 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Credit Risk

Investments

 

Essentially all of the Company's invested assets are subject to credit risk. In 2020, net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and the increase (decrease) in ACL on mortgage loans were $28 and $19 respectively. In 2019. credit related impairments were $3 and there were no mortgage loans that had a valuation allowance. (See the Investment Portfolio Risk section of Financial Risk Management under “Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments" and "ACL on Mortgage Loans”).

Reinsurance recoverables

 

Reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, were $6,011 and $5,527 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. (See the Enterprise Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy.”)

Premiums receivable and agents' balances

 

Premiums receivable and agents’ balances, net of an ACL, were $4,268 and $4,384, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For a discussion regarding collectibility of these balances, see Note 8 - Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Risk of Derivatives

The Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.

Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company’s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require additional collateralization before entering into any new trades.

Managing the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments

The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company’s policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management.

The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International 

Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. 

The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. Credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s net fair value, including income accruals, of all derivative positions transacted with a single counterparty for each separate legal entity. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. The Company enters into collateral arrangements in connection with its derivatives positions and collateral is pledged to or held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the exposure is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds or negotiated thresholds, if applicable. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual requirements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of Credit Derivatives

The Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.

Credit Risk Reduced Through Credit Derivatives

The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $6 and $124, respectively, while the fair value was less than $(1) and $(3), respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.

Credit Risk Assumed Through Credit Derivatives

The Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. These swaps primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers and indexes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $675 and $500, respectively, while the fair value was $21 and $13, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.

For further information on credit derivatives, see Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Risk of Business Operations

A portion of the Company's Commercial Lines business is written with large deductibles or under retrospectively-rated plans. Under some commercial insurance contracts with a large deductible, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim and the Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. As such, the Company is subject to credit risk until reimbursement is made. Retrospectively-rated policies are utilized primarily for 

98

Table of Contents

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

workers' compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is adjusted based on actual losses incurred. Although the premium adjustment feature of a retrospectively-rated policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it presents credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such policyholders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the amount of additional premium owed under retrospectively-rated policies. The Company manages these credit risks through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and regular monitoring. For more information, see Note 8- Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads. 

Sources of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from its fixed maturity investments, commercial mortgage loans we invest in as well as debt securities, preferred stock and similar securities issued by the Company and discount rate assumptions associated with the Company’s claim reserves and pension and other post retirement benefit obligations as well as from assets that support the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 

Impact 

Changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the Company.

For a discussion of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity section of this MD&A.

Management

 The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that seek 

to protect the firm from the economic impact associated with changes in interest rates by setting portfolio duration targets that are aligned with the duration of the liabilities that they support. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flow simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and the associated liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration. 

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or to hedge liabilities. Interest rate caps, floors, swaps, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flows of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $10.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, and primarily relate to hedging invested assets. The fair value of these derivatives was $(69) and $(59) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Interest Rate Risk

Fixed income investments

 The fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $52.8 billion and $49.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 4.9 years and 5.0 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of fixed maturities due to changes in interest rates are reflected as a component of AOCI.

Long-term debt obligations

 The Company's variable rate debt obligations will generally result in increased interest expense as a result of higher interest rates; the inverse is true during a declining interest rate environment. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

99

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Group life and disability product liabilities

 The cash outflows associated with contracts issued by the Company's Group Benefits segment, primarily group life and short and long-term disability policy liabilities, are not interest rate sensitive but vary based on timing. Though the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable, these products rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $8,653 and $8,667, respectively of reserves for group life and disability contracts. Changes in the value of the liabilities as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations

 The Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations are exposed to interest rate risk based upon the sensitivity of present value obligations to changes in liability discount rates as well as the sensitivity of the fair value of investments in the plan portfolios to changes in interest rates. The discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve that reflects high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. The Company is exposed to the risk of having to make additional plan contributions if the plans’ investment returns, including from investments in fixed maturities, are lower than expected. (For further discussion of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, refer to Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $669 and $732, respectively, of unfunded liabilities for pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recorded within Other Liabilities in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Group Life and Disability Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them

Included in the following table is the before tax change in the net economic value of contracts issued by the Company’s Group Benefits segment, primarily group life and disability, for which fixed valuation discount rate assumptions are established based upon investment returns assumed in pricing, along with the corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of other insurance products such as automobile, property, workers' compensation and general liability insurance. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.

The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ 

materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. The Company’s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

Long-term Debt

A 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would result in an increase in the fair value of long-term debt by $670 and $607 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term debt by $551 and $499 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will not impact the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plan Obligations

A 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would impact both the value of the underlying pension assets and the value of the liabilities, resulting in an increase in the unfunded liabilities for pension and other post-retirement plan obligations of $196 and $185 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would have the inverse effect and result in a decrease in the unfunded liabilities for pension and other post-retirement plan obligations of $148 and $138 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gains or losses due to changes in interest rates on the pension and post-retirement plan obligations are recorded within AOCI and are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold.

Discontinuation of LIBOR 

In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that by the end of 2021 it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to report information used to set LIBOR, which could result in LIBOR no longer being published after 2021 or a determination by regulators that LIBOR is no longer representative of its underlying market. The Company continues to monitor the potential impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR, which is used as a benchmark or reference rate for certain investments and derivatives the Company owns and floating rate debt the Company has issued. In December 2020, based on feedback from the banks that report information used to set LIBOR, Intercontinental Exchange ("ICE") Benchmark Administration released a consultation on the potential for banks to continue to publish U.S. dollar LIBOR rates until the end of June 2023. Subject to the results of the consultation, it is possible that some U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will continue to be available for a limited period beyond the end of 2021. 

The Company has identified three principal types of outstanding contracts that may be affected by the discontinuation of or transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including floating rate fixed maturity investments the Company holds in its investment portfolio; derivative instruments that hedge interest rate risk; and two classes of junior subordinated debentures that the Company has issued and are currently outstanding.

Using our best estimate of expected future cash flows including prepayments and maturities, the book value of LIBOR referenced floating rate fixed maturities that the Company owns as of December 31, 2020 and that the Company expects to be outstanding at the end of 2021 is approximately $3.6 billion. The Company has performed a review of the LIBOR replacement language on these assets and believes that greater than 85% have language that supports a transition to a new standard benchmark rate. The 

Company will continue to assess the remaining holdings and work with counterparties, as appropriate, to determine LIBOR replacement language or manage the assets in other ways, such as through asset sales.

•

The notional amount of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2020 with a floating rate component that references LIBOR that the Company expects to be outstanding at the end of 2021, considering maturities, is $9.6 billion, with $9.4 billion being cleared through an exchange or clearinghouse. The Company anticipates that substantially all existing derivatives referencing LIBOR, whether or not cleared through an exchange or clearing house, will transition from LIBOR to SOFR or other market alternative rates in line with new market standards currently being developed and adopted.

•

The Company has issued $1.1 billion of junior subordinated debentures that mature after 2021 with LIBOR referenced floating interest rates. The Company is assessing options to manage the risk associated with the transition away from LIBOR related to these outstanding securities. 

The uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR, including the timing of such transition, could reduce the value of some of our floating rate fixed maturity investments and increase the interest the Company pays on the junior subordinated debentures. 

There is also a risk that certain derivatives may no longer qualify for hedge accounting if reference rates change on derivative contracts but the reference interest rate of the instruments being hedged do not change in a substantially similar manner, particularly for cash flow hedges of floating rate investments the Company owns and junior subordinated debentures the Company has issued. The loss of hedge accounting could result in the recognition of gains or losses on derivatives in the income statement rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company has adopted the FASB's temporary guidance which allows The Hartford to account for contract modifications made solely due to rate reform (such as replacing LIBOR with another reference rate) as continuations of existing contracts and to maintain hedge accounting when the hedging effectiveness between the financial instrument and its hedge is only affected by the change to a replacement rate. The guidance expires for contract modifications made and hedge relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, after which, there is uncertainty whether certain outstanding derivative contracts will continue to qualify for hedge accounting either because the replacement rate of the financial instrument being hedged is not sufficiently matched to the reference rate of the derivative contract or because replacement rate language for the hedged instrument has not been determined.

 

Equity Risk

Equity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices. 

Sources of Equity Risk

 The Company has exposure to equity risk from invested assets, assets that support the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, and fee income derived from Hartford Funds assets under management. In addition, the Company has equity exposure through its 9.7% ownership interest in the limited partnership, Hopmeadow Holdings LP, that owns the life and annuity business

Impact 

The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, which could negatively impact the Company's reported earnings. In addition, investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments generally have a level of correlation to domestic equity market levels and can expose the Company to losses in earnings if valuations decline; however, earnings impacts are recognized on a lag as results from private equity investments and other funds are generally reported on a three-month delay. For assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. Hartford Funds earnings are also significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of average daily assets under management and the amount of fee income generated from those assets. Increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact. 

For a discussion of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity section of this MD&A.

Management

 The Company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, and, at times, hedging of changes in equity indices. For assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Equity Risk 

Investment portfolio

 The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, and certain alternative assets and limited partnerships. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of these types of investments and could negatively impact the Company’s earnings while increases in equity will have the inverse impact. For equity securities, the changes in fair value are reported in net realized capital gains and losses. For 

alternative assets and limited partnerships, the Company's share of earnings for the period is recorded in net investment income, though typically on a delay based on the availability of the underlying financial statements. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.

Assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans

 The Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below. 

Declines in value are recognized as unrealized losses in AOCI. Increases in equity markets are recognized as unrealized gains in AOCI. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold. For further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets under management

 Assets under management in Hartford Funds may decrease in value during equity market declines, which would result in lower earnings because fee income is earned based upon the value of assets under management.

Equity Sensitivity

Investment portfolio and the assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans

Included in the following tables are the estimated before tax change in the economic value of the Company’s invested assets and assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans with sensitivity to equity risk. The calculation of the hypothetical change in economic value below assumes a 20% upward and downward shock to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). For limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the movement in economic value is calculated using a beta analysis largely derived from historical experience relative to the S&P 500.

The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. These calculations do not capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations.

the estimated before tax impact on reported earnings for that one year period is approximately $60 as of December 31, 2020.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.

Sources of Currency Risk 

The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities, and derivative instruments. In addition, the Company has non-U.S. subsidiaries, some with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar, and which transact business in multiple currencies resulting in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

Impact 

Changes in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities. The impact on the fair value of fixed maturities, AFS due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, is reported in unrealized gains or losses as part of other comprehensive income. The realization of gains or losses resulting from investment sales or from changes in investments that record changes in fair value through the income statement due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is reflected through net realized capital gains and losses.

In regards to insurance and reinsurance contracts that the Company enters into for which we are obligated to pay losses in a foreign currency, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities related to these contracts is reflected through net realized capital gains and losses. These assets or liabilities include, but are not limited to, cash and cash equivalents, premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables, and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Additionally, the Company translates the assets, liabilities, and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities into U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.

Management 

The Company manages its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through asset-liability matching and through the use of derivative instruments. However, legal entity 

capital is invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations. The foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using foreign currency swaps and forwards.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Investment portfolio

 The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk affecting non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities and derivative instruments. Changes in relative values between currencies can positively or negatively impact net realized capital gains and losses or unrealized gains (losses) as part of other comprehensive income.

Assets supporting pension plan 

Changes in relative values between currencies can positively or negatively impact unrealized gains and losses in AOCI. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had pension plan assets of $95 and $83, respectively, of non-U.S. dollar investments in multiple currencies. These amounts are excluded from the sensitivity analysis below. 

Insurance contract related assets and liabilities 

The Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated insurance contracts and associated premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, that are exposed to foreign exchange risk. For contracts that are within U.S, dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can positively or negatively impact net realized capital gains and losses. For contracts within non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can positively or negatively impact other comprehensive income.

Foreign Currency Sensitivity

For the Company’s primary currencies that create foreign exchange risk, the following table provides the estimated impact of a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. The amounts presented are in U.S. dollars and before-tax.

Financial Risk on U.S. Statutory Capital

U.S. Statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:

•

A decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening or a decline in equity market levels, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

•

A decline in interest rates may reduce our net investment income, which may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

•

Decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

•

Non-market factors can also impact the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

Most of these factors are outside of the Company’s control. Among other factors, rating agencies consider the level of statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as 

well as the level of a measure of GAAP capital held by the Company in determining the Company’s financial strength and credit ratings. Rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.

Investment Portfolio Risk

The following table presents the Company’s fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality. The credit ratings referenced throughout this section are based on availability and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used. Accrued interest receivable related to fixed maturities are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not included in the amortized cost or fair value of the fixed maturities. For further information refer to Note 6 - Investments.

Represents the ACL recorded following the adoption of accounting guidance for credit losses on January 1, 2020. For further information refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

[2]

Includes securities with pools of loans issued by the Small Business Administration which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

The fair value of fixed maturities, AFS increased as compared with December 31, 2019, primarily due to net additions of corporate securities and an increase in valuations as a result of a decline in interest rates. The Company increased holdings in consumer cyclical and non-cyclical, financial services and technology/communication corporate bonds as well as in CLOs and taxable municipal bonds, while reducing holdings in tax-exempt municipal bonds, RMBS, and foreign government/government agencies.

Energy Exposure

Oil prices came under significant pressure during the first half of 

2020, particularly during March and April, largely due to the unprecedented reduction in demand stemming from the global pandemic as well as a decision by Saudi Arabia to raise production despite declining demand. The uncertain outlook caused credit spreads to widen for corporate and sovereign issuers that participate in the exploration, production, transportation and refining of oil and gas. Subsequently, OPEC Plus' agreement to reduce production in combination with recovering demand from economic re-openings has contributed to a strong recovery in oil prices to average levels for the post 2014 cycle. With the stabilization of oil prices, credit spreads have recovered

meaningfully. Ultimately, the impact of price volatility in the Company’s energy sector investments will be determined by the durability of the recovery in energy prices and the ability of issuers to maintain liquidity, manage indebtedness, and navigate changing regulations and growing consolidation trends within the industry. 

The Company's direct exposure within its investment portfolio to 

the energy sector totals approximately 3% of invested assets as of December 31, 2020 and is primarily comprised of investment grade corporate debt. These investments are diversified by issuer and different sub-sectors of the energy market, with the highest exposure to the midstream industry and the lowest to refining services. The following table summarizes the Company's exposure to the energy sector by security type and credit quality.

The Company manages the credit risk associated with the energy sector within the investment portfolio on an on-going basis using macroeconomic analysis and issuer credit analysis. The Company considers alternate scenarios including oil prices remaining at low levels for an extended period and/or declining significantly below current levels. For additional details regarding the Company’s management of credit risks, see the Credit Risk Section of this MD&A. The Company has evaluated available-for-sale securities with exposure to energy for a potential ACL as of December 31, 2020 and concluded that for all but one of the securities in an unrealized loss position, it is more likely than not that the Company will recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities. In addition, no other securities in the table above have been identified as intent-to-sell, nor is the Company required to sell. For additional details regarding the Company’s credit loss assessment process, see the Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments section below.

[1]Includes securities with pools of loans issued by the Small Business Administration which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

The Company also has exposure to commercial mortgage loans. These loans are collateralized by real estate properties that are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These commercial loans are originated by the Company as high quality whole loans, and the Company may sell participation interests in one or more loans to third parties. A loan participation interest represents a pro-rata share in interest and principal payments generated by the participated loan, and the relationship between the Company as loan originator, lead participant and servicer and the third party as a participant are governed by a participation agreement.

As of December 31, 2020, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $4.5 billion and carrying value of $4.5 billion, with an ACL of $38. As of December 31, 2019, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $4.2 billion and carrying value of $4.2 billion with no valuation allowance. The increase in the allowance is attributable 

to both the recognition of an ACL in connection with the adoption of accounting guidance for credit losses on January 1, 2020 and the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the economic forecasts, as well as lower estimated property values and operating income as compared to the prior year. For further information refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company funded $647 of commercial mortgage loans with a weighted average loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 59% and a weighted average yield of 3.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The Company continues to originate commercial mortgage loans in high growth markets across the country focusing primarily on institutional-quality industrial and multi-family properties with strong LTV ratios. There were no

Pre-refunded bonds are bonds for which an irrevocable trust containing sufficient U.S. treasury, agency, or other securities has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest.

[2]

Leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.

As of December 31, 2020, the largest issuer concentrations were the New York Dormitory Authority, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. As of December 31, 2019, the largest issuer concentrations were the New York Dormitory Authority, the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. In total, municipal bonds make up 17% of the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio. While COVID-19 has had an impact on many municipal issuers, the average credit quality of the Company’s holdings is AA-, and the Company believes the issuers in which it invests have multiple levers to maintain the strength of their credit profile.

Limited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments

The following table presents the Company’s investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds. Real estate funds consist of investments primarily in real estate joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, equity funds. Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential, and 

strong owner sponsorship, as well as limited exposure to public markets.

Income or losses on investments in limited partnerships and alternative investments are recognized on a lag as results from private equity investments and other funds are generally reported on a three-month delay.

Fixed Maturities, AFS — Unrealized Loss Aging 

The total gross unrealized losses were $63 as of December 31, 2020, and have increased $8 from December 31, 2019, primarily due to wider credit spreads within higher yielding corporates and CMBS. As of December 31, 2020, $49 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed less than 20% of amortized cost. The remaining $14 of gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed greater than 20%. The fixed maturities, AFS depressed more than 20% were primarily related to one variable-rate coupon corporate issuer with a long-dated maturity date as well as commercial real estate securities that were purchased at tighter credit spreads.

As part of the Company’s ongoing investment monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these fixed maturities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the investments approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position where an ACL has not been recorded, the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the investment. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these investments. For further information regarding the Company’s ACL analysis, see the Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments section below.

Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments

For the year ended December 31, 2020

The Company recorded net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS of $28. The losses were primarily attributable to corporate fixed maturities, mainly one private regional and commercial aircraft lessor and to a lesser extent, one tax-exempt municipal bond impacted by COVID-19. Unrealized losses on securities with ACL recognized in other comprehensive income were $1. For further information, refer to Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Intent-to-sell impairments of $5 were primarily related to one corporate issuer in the energy sector and one issuer with exposure to India.

The Company incorporates its best estimate of future performance using internal assumptions and judgments that are informed by economic and industry specific trends, as well as our expectations with respect to security specific developments.

Future intent-to-sell impairments or credit losses may develop as the result of changes in our intent to sell specific securities that are in an unrealized loss position or if modeling assumptions, such as macroeconomic factors or security specific developments, change unfavorably from our current modeling assumptions, resulting in lower cash flow expectations. For a discussion of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity section of this MD&A.

For the year ended December 31, 2019

Impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of credit impairments of $3 primarily related to two corporate securities experiencing issuer-specific financial difficulties. 

Non-credit impairments recognized in other comprehensive income were $3.

ACL on Mortgage Loans

The Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to estimate the ACL with changes in the ACL recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. Apart from an ACL recorded on 

individual mortgage loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company records an ACL on the pool of mortgage loans based on lifetime expected credit losses. For further information, refer to Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

For the year-ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an increase in the ACL on mortgage loans of $19. The increase in the allowance was due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the economic forecasts, as well as lower estimated property values and operating income as compared to the prior year. The Company did not record an ACL on any individual mortgage loans.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The following section discusses the overall financial strength of The Hartford and its insurance operations including their ability to generate cash flows from each of their business segments, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs over the next twelve months.

SUMMARY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

2021 expected dividends and other sources of capital:

The future payment of dividends from our subsidiaries is dependent on several factors including the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity

•

P&C - 

The Company's U.S. property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have dividend capacity of $1.7 billion for 2021, with $850 to $900 of net dividends expected in 2021.

•

Group Benefits -

 HLA has dividend capacity of $295 in 2021 with $250 to $295 of dividends expected in 2021. 

•

Hartford Funds

 - HFSG Holding Company expects to receive $125 to $150 in dividends from Hartford Funds in 2021. 

Expected liquidity requirements for the next twelve months as of December 31, 2020:

•

$215 of interest on debt.

•

$21 dividends on preferred stock, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

•

$500 of common stockholders' dividends, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and before share repurchases.

Equity repurchase program:

In December, 2020, the Company announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors, which is effective from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022. The Company’s 2019 share repurchase program expired on December 31, 2020.

Liquidity Requirements and Sources of Capital

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("HFSG Holding Company")

The liquidity requirements of the holding company of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. will primarily be met by HFSG Holding Company’s fixed maturities; short-term investments and cash; and dividends, principally from its subsidiaries.

The Company maintains sufficient liquidity and has a variety of contingent liquidity resources to manage liquidity across a range of economic scenarios. To date, the impact of the pandemic and resulting economic downturn on net operating cash flows have been relatively modest. The amount of such impacts will ultimately depend on the length and severity of the pandemic and its effects on the economy. We continue to expect to successfully manage our liquidity throughout the pandemic.

In parts of the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company waived late payment fees for a period of time for business and personal insurance customers and temporarily suspended the 

policy cancellation process for policyholders of our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits segments. Due to those actions and the economic effects of the pandemic, we experienced an increase in uncollectible premiums receivable and, accordingly, increased our current expected credit loss allowance on premiums receivable by $40 before tax for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The HFSG Holding Company expects to continue to receive dividends from its operating subsidiaries in the future and manages capital in its operating subsidiaries to be sufficient under significant economic stress scenarios . Dividends from subsidiaries and other sources of funds at the holding company may be used to repurchase shares under the authorized share repurchase program at the discretion of management.

Under significant economic stress scenarios that could arise due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has the ability to meet short-term cash requirements, if needed, by borrowing under its revolving credit facility or by having its insurance subsidiaries take collateralized advances under a facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”). The Company could also choose to have its insurance subsidiaries sell certain highly liquid, high quality fixed maturities or the Company could issue debt in the public markets under its shelf registration. No borrowings or advances have occurred to date.

During the second quarter of 2020, fixed maturities, with a value of $63 as of December 31, 2020, were deposited by Hartford Fire Insurance Company into a Lloyd’s trust account to provide required capital to The Hartford’s Lloyd’s Syndicate. During the fourth quarter of 2020, additional fixed maturities, with a value of $112 as of December 31, 2020, were deposited by Hartford Fire Insurance Company into this trust account. This transaction provided required capital to The Hartford's Lloyd's syndicate, by which we reduced the amount of letters of credit under the Lloyd's Letter of Credit Facility supporting Lloyd's capital requirements. This was in accordance with the Lloyd's requirements reducing the maximum amount of letters of credit permitted to support Lloyd's capital requirements as of the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, a total of $175 of fixed maturities were held by Hartford Fire Insurance Company in this trust account.

In July 2020, the Company contributed €18 million to Navigators Holdings (Europe) N.V., a Belgium holding company.

In September 2020, the Company received a $30 dividend from its retained equity interest in the legal entity that acquired the life and annuity business sold in May 2018.

Through December 30, 2020, HFSG Holding Company received cash tax receipts of $533, including realization of net operating losses and refunds of prior period AMT credits.

Debt

On March 30, 2020, The Hartford repaid at maturity the $500 principal amount of its 5.5% senior notes.

For additional information on Debt, see Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Equity

In December, 2020, the Company announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors which is effective from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

During the period from January 1, 2021 through February 18, 2021, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares for $56. The timing of any future repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the market price of the Company's securities, the Company's capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company's financial strength or credit ratings, and other considerations.

Under the previous $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization that was effective through December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 2.7 million and 3.4 million shares for $150 and $200 during the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s 2019 share repurchase program expired on December 31, 2020.

There are no current restrictions on HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. 

For a discussion of restrictions on dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries, see the following "Dividends from Subsidiaries" discussion. For a discussion of potential restrictions on the HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1A, — Risk Factors for the risk factor "Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations."

Dividends from Subsidiaries

Dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. Upon the acquisition of Navigators Group, the Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium.

The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under 

statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. 

Property casualty insurers domiciled in New York, including Navigators Insurance Company ("NIC") and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company ("NSIC"), generally may not, without notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner, pay dividends out of earned surplus in any twelve‑month period that exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the most recent financial statement on file, or (ii) 100% of its adjusted net investment income, as defined, for the same twelve month period. As part of the New York state insurance commissioner's approval of the Navigators Group acquisition, and as is common practice, any dividend from NIC and NSIC before May 2021 will require prior approval from the state insurance commissioner. 

The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.

Corporate members of Lloyd's Syndicates may pay dividends to its parent to the extent of available profits that have been distributed from the syndicate in excess of the Funds at Lloyd's ("FAL") capital requirement. The FAL is determined based on the syndicate’s solvency capital requirement under the Solvency II capital adequacy model, the current regulatory framework governing UK domiciled insurers, plus a Lloyd’s specific economic capital assessment. 

Insurers domiciled in the United Kingdom may pay dividends to their parent out of their statutory profits subject to restrictions imposed under U.K. Company law and Solvency II. Belgium domiciled insurers may only pay dividends if, at the end of their previous fiscal year, the total amount of their assets, as reduced by its provisions and debts, are in excess of certain minimum capital thresholds calculated under Belgian law. 

In 2020, HFSG Holding Company received $350 of dividends from HLA and $127 from Hartford Funds. In addition, HFSG Holding Company received $900 of net dividends from P&C subsidiaries in 2020 which excludes $50 of P&C dividends that were subsequently contributed to a run-off P&C subsidiary and $78 of P&C dividends related to interest payments on an intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. ("HHI") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company.

Other Sources of Capital for the HFSG Holding Company

The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the "Ratings" section below for further discussion), and stockholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of debt, common equity, preferred stock, equity-related debt or 

112

Index to MD&A

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. The issuance of debt, common equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of stockholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense.

Shelf Registrations

The Hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("the SEC") on May 17, 2019 that permits it to offer and sell debt and equity securities during the three-year life of the registration statement.

For further information regarding Shelf Registrations, see Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revolving Credit Facilities

The Company has a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") that provides up to $750 of unsecured credit through March 29, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding, no letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

Commercial Paper

On December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors terminated the HFSG Holding Company's commercial paper program, under which the maximum borrowings available were $750. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity and continues to have a variety of other contingent liquidity resources to meet its short-term liquidity requirements.

Intercompany Liquidity Agreements

The Company has $2.0 billion available under an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Department of Insurance ("CTDOI") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes.

As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding at the HFSG Holding Company.

Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston

The Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and HLA, are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. Advances may be used to support general corporate purposes, which would be presented as short- or long-term debt, or to earn incremental investment income, which would be presented in other liabilities consistent with other collateralized financing transactions. As of December 31, 2020, there were no advances outstanding. The Connecticut Department of Insurance permits Hartford Fire and HLA to pledge up to $1.2 billion and $0.6 billion in qualifying assets, respectively, without prior approval, to secure FHLBB advances in 2021. For further information regarding the Company's collateralized advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, see Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Lloyd's Letter of Credit Facilities

 

As a result of the acquisition of Navigators Group, The Hartford had two letter of credit facility agreements: the Club Facility and the Bilateral Facility, which were used to provide a portion of the capital requirements at Lloyd's. As of September 30, 2020, uncollateralized letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $165 and £60 million, or $78, were outstanding under the Club Facility and £18 million, or $23, was outstanding under the $25 Bilateral Facility. These agreements terminated on November 5, 2020.

On November 5, 2020, The Hartford entered into a new committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the “Club Facility”). The Club Facility has two tranches with one tranche extending a $104 commitment and the other tranche extending a £85 million ($116 as of December 31, 2020) commitment. In addition, on November 5, 2020, The Hartford entered into a new non-committed $25 credit facility with a lender (the “Bilateral Facility”). The term of both of these facilities is two years. The purpose of these facilities is to issue letters of credit to provide Funds at Lloyd’s to support underwriting capacity provided by the Navigators Corporate Underwriters Limited to the Lloyd’s Syndicate for the 2021 and 2022 underwriting years of account (and prior open years). As of December 31, 2020, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $104 and £85 million, or $116, were outstanding under the Club Facility and no letters of credit were outstanding under the Bilateral Facility.

Among other covenants, the Club Facility and Bilateral Facility contain financial covenants regarding The Hartford’s consolidated net worth and financial leverage and that limit the amount of letters of credit that can support Funds at Lloyd’s, consistent with Lloyd’s requirements. As of December 31, 2020, The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants of both facilities.

Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

While the Company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum contributions are mandated in certain circumstances pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21) and Internal Revenue Code regulations. The Company made contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately $70, $70 and $101 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company’s 2020, 2019 and 2018 required minimum funding contributions were immaterial. The Company does not have a 2021 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2021 to make this determination.

Derivative Commitments

Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. For further information, refer to Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2020, no derivative positions would be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings. This could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.

Insurance Operations

While subject to variability period to period, underwriting and investment cash flows continue to provide sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. For information about the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's cash flows see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion and tabular presentation of the Company’s current contractual obligations by period, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations within the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A.

The principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from assets under management and investment income, while investing cash flows primarily originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting and insurance operating costs, to pay taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the HFSG Holding Company.

The Company’s insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as “Property & Casualty Operations”) and Group Benefits.

The Company's insurance operations hold fixed maturity securities including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase) to meet liquidity needs. Liquidity requirements that are 

unable to be funded by the Company's insurance operations' short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating funds, including premiums or investing cash flows, which includes proceeds received through the sale of invested assets. A sale of invested assets could result in significant realized capital losses.

The following tables represent the fixed maturity holdings, including the aforementioned cash and short-term investments available to meet liquidity needs, for each of the Company’s insurance operations.

[1]

The following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations (gross of reinsurance) under property and casualty contracts:

•

Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include IBNR and case reserves. While payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the Company, the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and IBNR is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future.

•

In estimating the timing of future payments by year, the Company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue. However, the actual timing of future payments could vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims. In addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that may be used, in part, to fund loss payments.

•

Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is only permitted to discount reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. For the Company, these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants. As of December 31, 2020, the total property and casualty reserves in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $367.

•

Amounts shown do not consider $5.7 billion of reinsurance and other recoverables the Company expects to collect related to property and casualty obligations.

[2]

 Estimated group life and disability obligations are based on assumptions comparable with the Company’s historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results. As of December 31, 2020, the total group life and disability obligations in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $1.4 billion. 

[3]

Includes undiscounted lease payments on operating lease agreements, including leases that have not yet commenced. See Note 21 - Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on lease commitments.

[4]

 Long-term debt obligations include payments of contractual principal and interest through final maturity. Contractual interest payments are based on stated rates for fixed rate notes and based on prevailing rates at December 31, 2020 for the period of time the Company’s junior subordinated debentures have floating rates. Interest payments do not consider the impact of future rate movements. Payments exclude amounts associated with an interest rate swap of the Company’s $500 junior subordinated debenture. See Note 14 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.

[5]

Includes $1.1 billion in commitments to purchase investments including approximately $804 of limited partnership and other alternative investments, $79 of private debt and equity securities, and $236 of mortgage loans. Of the $1.1 billion in commitments to purchase investments, $149 are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally. Outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be reliably estimated. In addition, $904 relates to commitments to purchase investments which are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining balance relates to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, and information technology in the normal course of business, as well as unfunded tax credit investments. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancellable without penalty or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.

[6]

Includes cash collateral of $30 which the Company has accepted in connection with the Company’s derivative instruments. Since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year.

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019

Net cash provided by operating activities 

increased as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the inclusion of Navigators Group for the full year in 2020, subrogation benefit distributions collected of $227 arising from the PG&E settlement agreement, a decrease in claims paid for Group Benefits and P&C excluding Navigators, lower operating expenses paid and the deferral of paying payroll taxes as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, partially offset by lower P&C premiums received excluding Navigators and a lower refund of AMT credits.

Cash used for investing activities

 decreased primarily due to the acquisition of Navigators Group for $1.9 billion in 2019, an increase in net proceeds from equity securities, and a decrease in net payments from mortgage loans, partially offset by a change from net proceeds to net payments from short-term investments, and an increase in net purchases of partnerships and fixed maturities.

Cash used for financing activities

 increased primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from issuing debt and a larger net decrease in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt.

Operating cash flows

 for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.

Equity Markets

For a discussion of the potential impact of the equity markets on capital and liquidity, see the Financial Risk on Statutory Capital and Liquidity Risk section in this MD&A.

Ratings

Ratings are an important factor in establishing a competitive position in the insurance marketplace and impact the Company's ability to access financing and its cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue for any given period of time, or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings are downgraded, the Company’s competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted. 

On June 19, 2020, A.M. Best raised its financial strength rating on Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA") to A+ from A. The upgrade is reflective of the support provided by The Hartford, as well as the group benefits business' growing contribution to consolidated revenue and earnings and the overall diversification it provides.

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of The Hartford’s securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. The system and the number of rating categories can vary across rating agencies.

Among other factors, rating agencies consider the level of statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as well as the level of a measure of GAAP capital held by the Company in determining the Company's financial strength and credit ratings. Rating agencies may implement changes to their capital formulas that have the effect of increasing the amount of capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt.”

Stat to GAAP Differences

Significant differences between U.S. GAAP stockholders’ equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with U.S. STAT include the following:

•

U.S. STAT excludes equity of non-insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries not held by U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

•

Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under U.S. STAT.

•

Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while these amounts are then subject to further admissibility tests under U.S. STAT.

•

The assumptions used in the determination of Group Benefits reserves (i.e. for Group Benefits contracts) are prescribed under U.S. STAT, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company’s best estimates. 

•

The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while, under U.S. STAT, most investments are carried at amortized cost with only certain securities carried at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.

•

U.S. STAT for life insurance companies like HLA establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the Asset Valuation Reserve), while U.S. GAAP does not. Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.

•

Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for U.S. GAAP, while under U.S. STAT goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.

•

The deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance for losses ceded to the Navigators and A&E ADC agreements is recognized within a special category of surplus under U.S. STAT but is recognized within other liabilities under U.S. GAAP.

 

In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.

Risk-Based Capital

The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose RBC requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's U.S. operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.

Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries expect to maintain capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Sensitivity

In any particular period, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on these factors, see

MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management, Financial Risk on Statutory Capital.

Statutory capital at the insurance subsidiaries has been maintained at capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired RBC ratios and ratings from rating agencies. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting insurance results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments

COVID-19 Global Pandemic

State and federal retroactive business interruption coverage and other insurance regulatory relief initiatives - 

State and federal lawmakers are continuing to consider legislation and regulation in response to COVID-19. There have been proposals to impose retroactive coverage of COVID-19 claims under existing business interruption coverage provisions. If such proposals were enacted, they could represent a material exposure for the Company. Further, some states have adopted, or are considering incorporating, a presumption that if certain workers become infected with COVID-19, such infection would constitute an occupational disease triggering workers’ compensation coverage. In addition, state insurance regulators, including California, New Jersey and New York, have encouraged (and in some cases required) insurers to offer immediate relief to policyholders including refunding and offering discounts for drivers, incorporating flexible payment solutions for families, individuals, and businesses, providing additional time to make payments, waiving insurance premium late fees, pausing cancellation of coverage for personal and commercial policies due to non-payment and policy expiration, and suspending personal automobile exclusions for restaurant employees who are transitioning to meal delivery services using their personal automobile policy as coverage. The Hartford has offered consumer financial relief including a 15 percent refund on policyholders’ April and May 2020 personal automobile insurance premiums, waived late payments fees for a period of time for business and personal insurance customers and temporarily suspended policy cancellations for policyholders of our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits segments. As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues, regulators may require us to or we may elect to provide additional consumer and/or business financial relief. The duration and scope of such regulatory/Company actions are uncertain, and the impacts of 

such actions could adversely affect the Company’s insurance business. 

Federal pandemic risk insurance - 

Congress is considering possible action for future pandemic risk insurance coverage through a risk sharing mechanism between insurers and the federal government. Timing for any Congressional action with respect to these efforts is uncertain at this time. If such a program were to be enacted, it could represent a significant obligation for the company in terms of deductible and co-share obligations.

Federal emergency leave legislation - 

On March 18, 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act ("FFCRA") was signed into law by the President, and was effective from April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. This legislation included a number of funding provisions and worker protections including mandated emergency paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave programs. For private employers with fewer than 500 employees, and most public employers, new programs were put in place to guarantee individuals 10 days of paid sick leave, and up to 10 weeks of paid family and medical leave to deal directly with COVID-19. Eligible employers have access to a tax credit to reimburse for costs related to the emergency leave programs. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed into law and included a bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill. Although the mandatory paid leave provisions from the FFCRA expired on December 31, 2020, the new law extends FFCRA tax credits through March 31, 2021, for covered employers that voluntarily continue to offer paid leave under the FFCRA framework. The Hartford is providing support for the administration of the family and medical leave component of the FFCRA for our Group Benefits customers. Congress also approved a $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act. The bill, signed into law on March 27, 2020, focused on providing financial support for small businesses, individuals, emergency workers, airlines and other industries of national security. The CARES Act included several technical corrections to the emergency leave programs and created advance refunding credits, which allow the U.S. Treasury to develop regulations or guidance to permit advancement of the tax credit for both the emergency paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave. While any further Congressional action could trigger a significant increase in claims volume and compliance requirements for Group Benefits, the timing of additional legislation is unclear at this time.

Federal tax legislation - 

In response to the COVID-19 Global Pandemic, Congress, various states and other global jurisdictions have passed various pieces of legislation which contain various changes to the tax laws in order to aid impacted businesses and individuals, as well as provide economic stimulus. The Company deferred the employer’s portion of the Social Security tax on wages from March 27, 2020 to year-end 2020. Such deferred amounts would be due and payable over a two-year period, 50% by December 31, 2021 and 50% by December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the impact of these new tax laws on the Company. The U.S. Treasury and IRS continue to develop guidance implementing these new tax law provisions, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to these laws. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "Affordable Care Act")

 It is unclear whether the Administration, Congress or the courts will seek to reverse, amend or alter the ongoing operation of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"). If such actions were to occur, they may have an impact on various aspects of our business, including our insurance businesses. It is unclear what an amended ACA would entail, and to what extent there may be a transition period for the phase out of the ACA. The impact to The Hartford as an employer would be consistent with other large employers. The Hartford’s core business does not involve the issuance of health insurance, and we have not observed any material impacts on the Company’s workers’ compensation business or group benefits business from the enactment of the ACA. We will continue to monitor the impact of the ACA and any reforms on consumer, broker and medical provider behavior for leading indicators of changes in medical costs or loss payments primarily on the Company's workers' compensation and disability liabilities.

Tax Reform 

At the end of 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") was enacted. The TCJA made significant reforms to the U.S. tax code. The major areas of interest to the Company included the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the refunding of AMT credits. The U.S. Treasury and IRS continue to develop guidance implementing TCJA, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to the law. In addition, President Biden has indicated he will propose to 

increase the corporate tax rate to as high as 28% and revisit other aspects of TCJA. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. For additional information on risks to the Company related to TCJA, see the risk factor entitled "Changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity" under "Risk Factors" in Part I.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

The Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2020.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Hartford's management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most employees of the Company and of our vendors have had to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic though we will continue to assess the impact on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls.

Attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm

The Hartford's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.

Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion 

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

Equity Compensation Plan Information

 

The following table provides information as of December 31, 2020 about the securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans. The Company maintains The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2010 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2010 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2014 Stock Plan"), the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2020 Stock Plan") (collectively the "Stock Plans") and The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). 

On May 20, 2020, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2020 Stock Plan, which superseded the earlier plans. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2020 Stock Plan, no additional shares may be issued from the 2014 Stock Plan. To the extent that any awards under the 2005 Stock Plan, the 2010 Stock Plan and the 2014 Stock Plan are forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expire unexercised or are settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number of shares subject to the award, the shares subject to such awards (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for award under the 2020 Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the total number of shares available under the 2020 Stock Plan.

The amount shown in this column includes 6,693,188 outstanding options awarded under the 2005 Stock Plan, the 2010 Stock Plan, the 2014 Stock Plan and the 2020 Stock Plan. The amount shown in this column includes 3,866,452 outstanding restricted stock units and 789,237 outstanding performance shares at 100% of target (which excludes 276,434 shares that vested on December 27, 2020, related to the 2018-2020 performance period) as of December 31, 2020 under the 2014 Stock Plan and the 2020 Stock Plan. The maximum number of performance shares that could be awarded is 1,578,474 (200% of target) if the Company achieved the highest performance level. Under the 2014 and 2020 Stock Plans, no more than 500,000 shares in the aggregate can be earned by an individual employee with respect to restricted stock unit and performance share awards made in a single calendar year. As a result, the number of shares ultimately distributed to an employee with respect to awards made in the same year will be reduced, if necessary, so that the number does not exceed this limit.

The weighted-average exercise price reflects outstanding options and does not reflect outstanding restricted stock units or performance shares because they do not have exercise prices.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex audit judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description

For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. 

Given the subjectivity of estimating the ultimate cost to settle the liabilities for reported and unreported claims due to uncertainties caused by various factors including frequency and severity of claims as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2020, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included the following, among others: 

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses,

 

including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company's estimation processes.

•

We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s analysis, including historical claims.

•

With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses by:

•

Comparing the Company’s prior year assumptions of expected development of ultimate loss to actual losses incurred during the current year to identify potential management bias in the determination of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

•

Assessing the reasonableness of the Company’s analysis, and for selected reserving lines, developing independent estimates of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and comparing such estimates to the Company’s estimates.

 

Investments in Fixed Maturities Classified as Available-for-Sale - Refer to Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

Investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value in the financial statements. The investments without readily determinable fair values were valued using significant unobservable inputs, such as credit spreads and interest rates beyond the observable curve, that involved considerable judgment by the Company. 

Given the Company used models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, performing audit procedures to evaluate these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the models and unobservable inputs used by the Company to estimate the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company’s estimation processes. 

•

On a sample basis, we tested the accuracy and completeness of the investments owned as of December 31, 2020, and the relevant security attributes used in the determination of their fair values.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, for a sample of investments, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the fair value calculation and developed independent estimates of the fair value and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates. In addition to developing independent estimates, we obtained an understanding of the models and inputs used by the Company and assessed those models and inputs for reasonableness. Such assessment included comparing inputs to external sources or developing independent inputs.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

1.

 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty insurance, group life and disability products and mutual funds and exchange-traded products to individual and business customers in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and other international locations (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”).

On September 30, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the issued and outstanding equity of Navigators Holdings (Europe) N.V., a Belgium holding company, and its subsidiaries, Bracht, Deckers & Mackelbert N.V. (“BDM”) and Assurances Contintales Contintale Verzekeringen N.V. (“ASCO”), (collectively referred to as "Continental Europe Operations"). For further discussion of this transaction, see Note 22 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations.

On May 23, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of The Navigators Group, Inc. ("Navigators Group"), a global specialty underwriter, for $

70

 a share, or $

2.137

 billion in cash, including transaction expenses.

On May 31, 2018, Hartford Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of the issued and outstanding equity of Hartford Life, Inc. (“HLI”), a holding company, for its life and annuity operating subsidiaries.

For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 2 - Business Acquisitions and Note 22 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which differ materially from the accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.

 

Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but does not control are reported using the equity method. Intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated.

Discontinued Operations

The results of operations of a component of the Company are reported in discontinued operations when certain criteria are met as of the date of disposal, or earlier if classified as held-for-sale. When a component is identified for discontinued operations reporting, amounts for prior periods are retrospectively reclassified as discontinued operations. Components are identified as discontinued operations if they are a major part of an entity's operations and financial results such as a separate major 

line of business or a separate major geographical area of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty and group long-term disability insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; evaluation of goodwill for impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.

The novel strain of coronavirus, specifically identified as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect a global pandemic of this scale may have. As a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic, the duration and severity of the economic downturn and the degree to which federal, state and local government actions to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 are effective. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions related to COVID-19 could ultimately differ over time.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Reclassification of Effect of Tax Rate Change from AOCI to Retained Earnings

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") new guidance for the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform") enacted on December 22, 2017. Tax Reform reduced the federal tax rate applied to the Company’s deferred tax balances from 35% to 21% on enactment. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company recorded the total effect of the change in enacted tax rates on 

133

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

deferred tax balances as a charge to income tax expense within net income during the fourth quarter of 2017, including the change in deferred tax balances related to components of AOCI. The new accounting guidance permitted the Company to reclassify the “stranded” tax effects out of AOCI and into retained earnings that resulted from recording the tax effects of unrealized investment gains, unrecognized actuarial losses on pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and cumulative translation adjustments at a 35% tax rate because the 14 point reduction in tax rate was recognized in net income instead of other comprehensive income. On adoption, the Company recorded a reclassification of $

88

 from AOCI to retained earnings. As a result of the reclassification, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company reduced the estimated loss on sale recorded in income from discontinued operations by $

193

, net of tax, for the increase in AOCI related to the assets held for sale. The reduction in the loss on sale resulted in a corresponding increase in assets held for sale and AOCI as of January 1, 2018 and the AOCI associated with assets held for sale was removed from the balance sheet when the sale closed on May 31, 2018. Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, the Company reclassified $

105

 of stranded tax effects related to continuing operations which reduced AOCI and increased retained earnings. 

Financial Instruments- Recognition and Measurement

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted updated guidance issued by the FASB for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balances of retained earnings and AOCI. The new guidance requires investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income except for investments that are consolidated or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The new guidance also requires a deferred tax asset resulting from net unrealized losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale that are recognized in AOCI to be evaluated for recoverability in combination with the Company’s other deferred tax assets. Under prior guidance, the Company reported equity securities, available-for-sale ("AFS"), at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income. As of January 1, 2018, the Company reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings net unrealized gains of $

83

, after tax, related to equity securities having a fair value of $

1.0

 billion. In addition, $

10

 of net unrealized gains net of shadow DAC related to discontinued operations were reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings of the life and annuity business held for sale, which increased the estimated loss on sale in 2018 by the same amount. Beginning in 2018, the Company reports equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.

Revenue Recognition

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the FASB’s updated guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers, which excludes insurance contracts and financial instruments. Revenue subject to the guidance is recognized when, or as, goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity is expected to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For all but certain revenues associated with our Hartford Funds business, the updated guidance is consistent with previous guidance for the Company’s 

transactions and did not have an effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or net income. The updated guidance also updated criteria for determining when the Company acts as a principal or an agent.

Qualitative information about the nature, timing of recognition and cash flows for the Company’s revenues subject to the updated guidance is disclosed below under Significant Accounting Policies-Revenue Recognition and quantitative information is disclosed in Note 4 - Segment Information.

Hedging Activities

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB's updated guidance for hedge accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment of less than $

1

 to reclassify cumulative ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges from retained earnings to AOCI. The updates allow hedge accounting for new types of interest rate hedges of financial instruments and simplify documentation requirements to qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, any gain or loss from hedge ineffectiveness is reported in the same income statement line with the effective hedge results and the hedged transaction. For cash flow hedges, the ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings only when the hedged transaction affects earnings; otherwise, the ineffectiveness gains or losses remain in AOCI. Under previous accounting, total hedge ineffectiveness was reported separately in realized capital gains and losses apart from the hedged transaction. The adoption did not affect the Company’s financial position or cash flows or have a material effect on net income. 

Leases

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB’s updated lease guidance. Under the updated guidance, lessees with operating leases are required to recognize a liability for the present value of future minimum lease payments with a corresponding asset for the right of use of the property. Prior to the new guidance, future minimum lease payments on operating leases were commitments that were not recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. Leases are classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as a financing lease and the Company recognizes amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease is an operating lease and the lease cost is recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less are also expensed over the lease term but not recognized on the balance sheet. On adoption, The Hartford recorded a lease payment obligation of $

160

 for outstanding leases and a right of use asset of $

150

, which is net of $

10

 in lease incentives received, with no change to comparative periods. As permitted by the new guidance, as of the implementation date, the Company did not reassess whether expired or existing contracts are leases or contain leases, did not change the classification of expired or existing operating leases, and did not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases to determine if deferred costs should be written-off or recorded on adoption. The adoption did not impact net income or cash flows.

Goodwill

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the FASB's updated guidance on testing goodwill for impairment with 

no

 effect at adoption. The updated guidance requires impairment of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the estimated fair value, with the amount of the impairment not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. Under the updated guidance, changes in market-based factors are more likely to result in a goodwill impairment than under the prior accounting guidance, whether a reporting unit's fair value is estimated using an income approach or a market approach. For example, changes in the weighted average cost of capital that is used to discount expected cash flows under the income approach or changes in market-based factors such as peer company price to earnings multiples or price to book multiples under a market approach can significantly affect changes to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and such changes could result in impairments that have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the FASB’s updated guidance for recognition and measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for recognizing credit losses for financial instruments carried at other than fair value. Under the new model, for financial instruments carried at other than fair value, such as mortgage loans, reinsurance recoverables and receivables, an allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is recognized which is an estimate of credit losses expected over the life of financial instruments. Under the prior accounting model an ACL was recognized using an incurred loss approach. The new guidance also requires that we estimate a liability for credit losses ("LCL") on off balance sheet credit exposures such as financial guarantees and mortgage loan commitments that the Company cannot unconditionally cancel.

Credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS carried at fair value continue to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows compared to amortized cost; however, the losses are now recognized through an ACL and no longer as an adjustment to the amortized cost. Recoveries of credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS are now recognized as reversals of the ACL and no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to the investment yield. The ACL on fixed maturities, AFS cannot cause the net carrying value to be below fair value and, therefore, it is possible that future increases in fair value due to decreases in market interest rates could cause the reversal of the ACL and increase net income. The new guidance also requires purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance to be recorded based on contractual amounts due and an initial allowance recorded at the date of purchase. 

The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment that decreased retained earnings by $

18

, representing a net increase to the ACL and LCL, after tax. No ACL was recognized at adoption for fixed maturities, AFS; rather, these investments are evaluated for an ACL prospectively. The Company does not have any purchased 

financial assets with a more than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance.

Reference Rate Reform

On March 12, 2020, the Company adopted the FASB’s temporary guidance, which allows The Hartford to account for contract modifications made solely due to rate reform (such as replacing LIBOR with another reference rate) as continuations of existing contracts and to maintain hedge accounting when the hedging effectiveness between a financial instrument and its hedge is only affected by the change to a replacement rate. As a result, The Hartford will not recognize gains and losses during the transition period of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate that would otherwise have arisen from accounting assessments and remeasurements. The guidance expires for contract modifications made and hedge relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. The Company is not required to measure the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

effect of adoption on its financial position, cash flows or net income because the guidance provides relief from accounting for the effects of the change to a replacement rate. 

Mortgage Loan Modification

In 2020, The Hartford adopted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) Section 4013, which allows financial institutions the option to suspend the requirement to disclose and account for loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic occurring between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the end of the national emergency or January 1, 2022. The Company’s adoption of Section 4013 of the CARES Act had 

no

 impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows because The Hartford has not granted significant concessions to borrowers on its mortgage loans that would have been disclosed and accounted for as troubled debt restructurings.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Reserve for Future Policy Benefits 

The FASB issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts. The Company’s long-duration insurance contracts include paid-up life insurance and whole-life insurance policies resulting from conversion from group life policies and run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities with total future policy benefit reserves of $

638

 as of December 31, 2020. Under existing guidance, a reserve for future policy benefits is calculated as the present value of future benefits and related expenses less the present value of any future premiums using assumptions “locked in” at the time the policies were issued, including discount rate, lapse rate, mortality, and expense assumptions. Under existing guidance, assumptions are only updated if there is an expected premium deficiency. The new guidance will require that underlying cash flow assumptions (such as for lapse rate, mortality and expenses) be reviewed and updated at least annually in the same quarter each year. The new guidance also requires that the discount rate assumption be updated each quarter and be based on an upper-medium grade (low-credit-risk) fixed-income investment yield. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating cash flow assumptions will be recognized in net income. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating the discount rate assumption will be recognized in other comprehensive income. Because reserves will be based on updated assumptions and no longer locked in at contract inception, there will no longer be a test for premium deficiency. The new guidance will be effective January 1, 2023, and will be applied to balances in place as of the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet determined the method or timing for adoption or estimated the effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

The Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:

Revenue Recognition

Premium Revenue from Direct Insurance and Assumed Reinsurance

Property and casualty premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us, as well as ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. We estimate the amount of premium not yet reported based on current and historical trends of the business being written. Such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year's results. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force, or period of risk. 

Group life, disability and accident premiums are generally due from policyholders and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.

An estimated ACL is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds and considering historical credit loss information, adjusted for current economic conditions and effective January 1, 2020, reasonable and supportable forecasts when appropriate . The Company records total credit loss expenses related to premiums receivable in insurance operating costs and other expenses. Write-offs of premiums receivable and agents' balances and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Refer to Note 8 - Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances for further discussion regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances.

Revenue from Non-Insurance Contracts with Customers

Installment fees are charged on property and casualty insurance contracts for billing the insurance customer in installments over the policy term. These fees are recognized in fee income as earned on collection.

Insurance servicing revenues within Personal Lines consist of up-front commissions earned for collecting premiums and processing claims on insurance policies for which The Hartford does not assume underwriting risk, predominantly related to the National Flood Insurance Plan program. These insurance servicing revenues are recognized over the period of the flood program's policy terms.

Group Benefits earns fee income from employers for the administration of underwriting, implementation and claims processing for employer self-funded plans and for leave management services. Fees are recognized as services are provided and collected monthly.

Hartford Funds provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded products. The Company assesses investment advisory, distribution and other asset management fees primarily based on the average daily net asset values from mutual funds and exchange-traded products, which are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected monthly.

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Fluctuations in domestic and international markets and related investment performance, volume and mix of sales and redemptions of mutual funds or exchange-traded products, and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.

Hartford Funds other fees primarily include transfer agent fees, generally assessed as a charge per account, and are recognized as fee income in the period in which the services are provided with payments collected monthly.

Corporate investment management and other fees are primarily for managing third party invested assets, including management of the invested assets of The Hartford’s former life and annuity business. These fees, calculated based on the average quarterly net asset values, are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected quarterly. Fluctuations in markets and interest rates and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.

Corporate transition service revenues consist of operational services provided to The Hartford’s former life and annuity business that are provided for a limited period following sale. The transition service revenues are recognized as other revenues in the period in which the services are provided with payments collected monthly.

Dividends to Policyholders

Policyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.

Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented 

7

%, 

9

% and 

10

% of total net written premiums for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Participating dividends to property and casualty policyholders were $

, $

30

 and $

23

 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

There were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.

Investments

Overview

The Company’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, structured securities, redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper. Most of these investments are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Effective January 1, 2018, equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement discussion above. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of an ACL. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the 

Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of investments of consolidated investment funds for which the Company has provided seed money and reports the underlying investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements for investment companies. Also included in other investments are derivative instruments which are carried at fair value, overseas deposits which are measured at fair value using the net asset value as a practical expedient and equity fund investments.

Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses

Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result from fair value changes in equity securities and derivatives contracts that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes. Prior to January 1, 2020, impairments of fixed maturities and changes in mortgage loan valuation allowances were recognized as net realized capital losses as discussed in Note 6 -Investments. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company records net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and changes in the ACL on mortgage loans as a component of net realized capital gains and losses. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Credit Losses discussion above.

Net Investment Income

Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on the estimated timing of cash flows. Most premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized to the maturity date. Premiums on callable bonds may be amortized to call dates based on call prices. For securitized financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method. For certain other asset-backed securities, including securities that previously had an ACL and interest only securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings. Prior to January 1, 2020, for impaired fixed maturities, the Company accreted the new amortized cost to the estimated future cash flows over the expected remaining life of the investment by prospectively adjusting the effective yield, if necessary. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company no longer records credit losses as adjustments to the amortized cost of the fixed maturity but rather records an ACL. Future changes in the ACL resulting from improvements in expected future cash flows are not recorded as adjustments to yield through net investment income but are recorded through net realized capital gains (losses). For fixed maturities with an ACL, net investment income is recognized at the original effective rate and accretion of the

ACL is recognized through net realized capital gains (losses). For further information, see Financial Instruments - Credit Losses discussion above. The Company’s non-income producing investments were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Derivative Instruments

Overview

The Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, derivatives cleared through central clearing houses ("OTC-cleared") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to engage in income generation covered call transactions and replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve the following Company-approved objectives: 

•

to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rates or volatility; 

•

to manage liquidity; 

•

to control transaction costs;

•

to enter into income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions.

Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.

The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which are reflected in realized capital gains and losses or, if characterized as interest, in net investment income. 

Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.

Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.

Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which 

grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.

Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.

The Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance departments.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty or under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.

On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.

Cash Flow Hedges - 

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - 

The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk 

138

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.

When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.

In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.

Embedded Derivatives

The Company purchases investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.

Credit Risk of Derivative Instruments

Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the 

derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require 

daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. The Co

mpany also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.

Cash and Restricted Cash

Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Restrictions on cash primarily relate to funds that are held to support regulatory and contractual obligations.

Reinsurance

The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.

Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e. risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as financing transactions.

Premiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are

reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its reinsurance recoverable assets and establishes an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The Company records credit losses related to reinsurance recoverables in benefits losses and loss adjustment expenses. Write-offs of reinsurance recoverables and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries are included in the estimate of the ACL. 

Retroactive reinsurance agreements, including adverse development covers, are reinsurance agreements under which our reinsurer agrees to reimburse us as a result of past insurable events. For these agreements, the consideration paid in excess of the estimated ultimate losses recoverable under the agreement at inception is recognized as a loss on reinsurance transaction. The benefit of subsequent adverse development ceded up to the total consideration paid is recognized as ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses. The excess of the estimated amounts ultimately recoverable under the agreement over the consideration paid is recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the period the ceded losses are recovered in cash from the reinsurer. The amount of the deferred gain liability is recalculated each period based on cumulative recoveries not yet collected relative to the latest estimate of ultimate losses recoverable. Ceded loss reserves under retroactive agreements were $

1.1

 billion and $

747

, and the deferred gain liability reported in other liabilities was $

328

 and $

16

, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In any given period, the change in deferred gain included in net income includes amortization of the deferred gain based on the percentage of ultimate ceded losses collected plus any change in the deferred gain liability due to changes in the estimated ultimate losses recoverable. The effect on income from change in the deferred gain was a charge to earnings of $

312

 and $

16

 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was 

no

 deferred gain in 2018.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

DAC represents costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts and incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or in compensation to employees. Such costs primarily include commissions, premium taxes, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully issued contracts.

For property and casualty insurance products and group life, disability and accident contracts, costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of DAC.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax provision is recorded for the tax effects of differences between the Company's current taxable income and its income before tax under generally accepted accounting principles in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. Prior to January 1, 2020, the goodwill impairment test followed a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit was compared to its carrying value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated consist of Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Group Benefits, and Hartford Funds. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the impairment test was performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss was recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Effective January 1, 2020, the goodwill impairment test is based on the first step only and, as such, goodwill is impaired up to the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. For further information, see Adoption of New Accounting Standards - Goodwill discussion above.

Management’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections, the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting and, for the Hartford Funds segment, assets under management. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.

Intangible Assets

Acquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer relationship and agency or other distribution rights and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from 

1

 to 

15

 years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. Finite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Impaired intangible assets are written down to fair value.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment, which includes capitalized software, is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is recognized principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $

2.1

 billion and $

1.9

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Depreciation expense was $

313

, $

283

, and $

232

 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance and assumed reinsurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. A number of complex factors influence the uncertainties involved with the reserving process including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by reserve line within the various 

reporting segments. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Most of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted to present value certain reserves for indemnity payments that are due to claimants under workers’ compensation policies because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rate is based on the risk free rate for the expected claim duration as determined in the year the claims were incurred. The Company also has discounted liabilities for structured settlement agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. These structured settlements include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants. These structured settlement liabilities are discounted to present value using the rate implicit in the purchased annuities and the purchased annuities are accounted for within reinsurance recoverables.

Group life and disability contracts with long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned on the cash flows net of investment expenses and expected credit losses. The Company establishes discount rates for these reserves in the year the claims are incurred (the incurral year) which is when the estimated settlement pattern is determined. The discount rate for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business were based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017.

For further information about how unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established, see Note 12 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.

Foreign Currency

Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies; however, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 ("Lloyd's Syndicate"), the Lloyd's Syndicate for which the Company is the sole corporate member, in the U.K. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings in realized capital gains (losses) in the period in which they occur

The value of in-force contracts represents the estimated profits relating to the unexpired contracts in force net of related prepaid reinsurance at the acquisition date through expiry of the contracts. The value of distribution relationships was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from the renewals of in-force contracts and new business sold through existing distribution partners less costs to service the related policies. The value of the trade name was estimated using an assumed cost of a market-based royalty fee applied to net cash flows expected to come from business marketed as Navigators, a brand of The Hartford. Lloyd's of London is an insurance market-place operating worldwide ("Lloyd's"). Lloyd's does not underwrite risks. Corporate members accept underwriting risks through the syndicates that they form. The Company accepts risks as the sole corporate member of Lloyd's Syndicate. The value of the capacity of Lloyd’s Syndicate was estimated using net cash flows attributable to Navigators Group's right to underwrite business up to an approved level of premium in the Lloyd’s market. The values for in-force contracts, the distribution relationships, trade name and the capacity of the Lloyd's Syndicate were estimated using a discounted cash flow method. Significant inputs to the valuation models include estimates of expected new business, premium retention rates, investment returns, claim costs, expenses and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital. The value of licenses to write insurance in over 50 U.S. jurisdictions was estimated based on recent transactions for shell companies.

Property and equipment includes real estate owned and right of use assets under leases that were valued based on current values and market rental rates, software that was valued based on estimated replacement cost and furniture and equipment. These will be amortized over periods consistent with the Company’s policy.

The fair value of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses net of related reinsurance recoverables was estimated based on the present value of expected future net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments discounted using a risk-free interest rate as of the acquisition date plus a risk margin. The discount and risk margin amounts substantially offset.

Debt assumed in the transaction was valued based on the principal and interest payments discounted at the current market 

yield. This debt was paid off in August 2019. For further discussion of this transaction, see Note 14 - Debt.

The $

621

 of goodwill recognized is largely attributable to the acquired employee workforce and underwriting talent, leverageable operating platform, improved investment yield and economies of scale. Goodwill is allocated to the Company's Commercial Lines reporting segment.

Immediately after closing on the acquisition of Navigators Group, effective May 23, 2019, the Company purchased an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering adverse reserve development (“Navigators ADC”) from National Indemnity Company ("NICO") on behalf of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Navigators Insurers”). Under the Navigators ADC, the Navigators Insurers paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $

91

 in exchange for reinsurance coverage of $

300

 of adverse net loss reserve development that attaches $

100

 above the Navigators Insurers' existing net loss and allocated loss adjustment reserves as of December 31, 2018 subject to the treaty of $

1.816

 billion for accidents and losses prior to December 31, 2018. In addition to recognizing a $

91

 before tax charge to earnings in 2019 for the Navigators ADC reinsurance premium, the Company recognized a charge against earnings of $

97

 before tax in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of a review of Navigators Insurers’ net acquired reserves upon acquisition of the business. Navigators Insurers had previously recognized $

52

 before tax of adverse reserve development in the first quarter of 2019, including $

32

 of adverse development subject to the Navigators ADC. As such, reserve development of $

97

 before tax recognized upon acquisition of the business included $

68

 remaining of the $

100

 Navigators ADC retention for 2018 and prior accident years and $

29

 of adverse reserve development related to the 2019 accident year which is not covered by the Navigators ADC. 

On 2018 and prior accident year reserves subject to the Navigators ADC, the Company recognized a total of $

84

 of adverse development in 2019, including the $

68

 of reserve development recorded upon acquisition of the business. The $

84

 of prior accident year reserve development was net of a $

91

 net reinsurance benefit recognized under the Navigators ADC. While the Company has ceded $

209

 of losses to the ADC through December 31, 2020, which has been recognized as a reinsurance recoverable, $

118

 of the ceded losses has been recognized as a deferred gain within other liabilities since the Navigators ADC has been accounted for as retroactive reinsurance and cumulative losses ceded of $

209

 exceed the ceded premium paid of $

91

. As the Company has ceded $

209

 of the $

300

 available limit, there is $

Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of assumed exercise or issuance of warrants and stock-based awards under compensation plans. 

In periods where a loss from continuing operations available to common stockholders or net loss available to common stockholders is recognized, inclusion of incremental dilutive shares would be antidilutive. Due to the antidilutive impact, such shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share 

calculation of income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders and net income (loss) available to common stockholders in such periods. 

Under the treasury stock method, for warrants and stock-based awards, shares are assumed to be issued and then reduced for the number of shares repurchasable with theoretical proceeds at the average market price for the period. Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if dilutive.

Note 4 - Segment Information

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. SEGMENT INFORMATION 

The Company conducts business principally in 

five

 reporting segments including Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Property & Casualty Other Operations, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. 

Over 95% of the Company’s revenues are generated in the United States (“U.S.”). The remaining revenues are generated in Europe and other international locations.

 

We report our results of operations consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviews the business to assess performance, make operating decisions and allocate resources. The Company’s reporting segments, as well as the Corporate category, are as follows:

Commercial Lines

Commercial Lines provides workers’ compensation, property, automobile, general liability, umbrella, professional liability, bond, marine, livestock and assumed reinsurance to businesses in the U.S. and internationally, along with a variety of customized insurance products and risk management services including professional liability, bond, surety, and specialty casualty coverages.

Personal Lines

Personal Lines provides standard automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the U.S., including a special program designed exclusively for members of AARP. This agreement provides an important competitive advantage given the size of the 50 plus population and the strength of the AARP brand. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company extended this agreement through December 31, 2032.

Property & Casualty Other Operations

Property & Casualty Other Operations includes certain property and casualty operations, managed by the Company, that have discontinued writing new business and includes substantially all of the Company’s asbestos and environmental exposures.

Group Benefits

Group Benefits provides employers, associations and financial institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and services, including voluntary benefits, and group retiree health.

Hartford Funds

Hartford Funds offers investment products for retail and retirement accounts and provides investment management and administrative services such as product design, implementation and oversight. This business also manages a portion of the mutual funds which support the variable annuity products within the life and annuity business sold in May 2018.

Corporate

The Company includes in the Corporate category discontinued operations related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, restructuring costs, capital raising activities (including debt financing and related interest expense), transaction expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition, certain purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and 

other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments. Corporate also includes investment management fees and expenses related to managing third party business, including management of the invested assets of Talcott Resolution Life, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Talcott Resolution"). In addition, Corporate includes a 9.7% ownership interest in the legal entity that acquired the life and annuity business sold in 2018.

Financial Measures and Other Segment Information

Certain transactions between segments occur during the year that primarily relate to tax settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements, services provided, investment transfers and capital contributions. In addition, certain inter-segment transactions occur that relate to interest income on allocated surplus. Consolidated net investment income is unaffected by such transactions.

Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The Company carries certain financial assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our fair value framework includes a hierarchy that gives the highest priority to the use of quoted prices in active markets, followed by the use of market observable inputs, followed by the use of unobservable inputs. 

The fair value hierarchy levels are as follows:

Level 1    Fair values based primarily on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities, in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2    Fair values primarily based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, or based on prices for similar assets and liabilities.

Level 3    Fair values derived when one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable (including assumptions about risk). With little or no observable market, the determination of fair values uses considerable judgment and represents the Company’s best estimate of an amount that could be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability. Also included are securities that are traded within illiquid markets and/or priced by independent brokers.

The Company will classify the financial asset or liability by level based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. In most cases, both observable inputs (e.g., changes in interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in risk assumptions) are used to determine fair values that the Company has classified within Level 3.

Valuation Techniques

The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market 

expectations. The Company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources and techniques, which are listed in priority order:

•

Quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, which are classified as Level 1.

•

Prices from third-party pricing services, which primarily utilize a combination of techniques. These services utilize recently reported trades of identical, similar, or benchmark securities making adjustments for market observable inputs available through the reporting date. If there are no recently reported trades, they may use a discounted cash flow technique to develop a price using expected cash flows based upon the anticipated future performance of the underlying collateral discounted at an estimated market rate. Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value of future cash flows and provide a margin for risk, including liquidity and credit risk. Most prices provided by third-party pricing services are classified as Level 2 because the inputs 

149

Table of Contents

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules

Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

used in pricing the securities are observable. However, some securities that are less liquid or trade less actively are classified as Level 3. Additionally, certain long-dated securities, such as municipal securities and bank loans, include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.

•

Internal matrix pricing, which is a valuation process internally developed for private placement securities for which the Company is unable to obtain a price from a third-party pricing service. Internal pricing matrices determine credit spreads that, when combined with risk-free rates, are applied to contractual cash flows to develop a price. The Company develops credit spreads using market based data for public securities adjusted for credit spread differentials between public and private securities, which are obtained from a survey of multiple private placement brokers. The market-based reference credit spread considers the issuer’s financial strength and term to maturity, using an independent public security index, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.

•

Independent broker quotes, which are typically non-binding, use inputs that can be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data. Brokers may use present value techniques using assumptions specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.

The fair value of derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporates counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily use inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by 

observable market data. The valuation of certain derivatives may include significant inputs that are unobservable, such as volatility levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. 

Valuation Controls

The process for determining the fair value of investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company. The purpose of the Valuation Committee is to provide oversight of the pricing policy, procedures and controls, including approval of valuation methodologies and pricing sources. The Valuation Committee reviews market data trends, pricing statistics and trading statistics to ensure that prices are reasonable and consistent with our fair value framework. Controls and procedures used to assess third-party pricing services are reviewed by the Valuation Committee, including the results of annual due-diligence reviews. Controls include, but are not limited to, reviewing daily and monthly price changes, stale prices, and missing prices and comparing new trade prices to third-party pricing services, weekly price changes to published bond prices of a corporate bond index, and daily OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations. The Company has a dedicated pricing unit that works with trading and investment professionals to challenge the price received by a third party pricing source if the Company believes that the valuation received does not accurately reflect the fair value. New valuation models and changes to current models require approval by the Valuation Committee. In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.

Valuation Inputs

Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-ended mutual funds, certain short-term investments, and exchange traded futures and option contracts.

The weighted average is determined based on the fair value of the derivatives.

Conversely, the impact of a decrease in input would have the opposite impact to the fair value as that presented in the table. Changes are based on long positions, unless otherwise noted. Changes in fair value will be inversely impacted for short positions.

The tables above exclude certain securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing 

services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. For

no

 significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.

Contingent Consideration

The acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC ("Lattice") on July 29, 2016 required the Company to make payments to former owners of Lattice of up to $

60

 contingent upon growth in exchange-traded products ("ETP") assets under management ("AUM") over a period of 

four years

 beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration was measured at fair value on a quarterly basis by projecting future eligible ETP AUM over the contingency period to estimate the amount of expected payout. The future expected payout had been discounted back to the valuation date using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 

10.0

%. The risk-adjusted discount rate is an internally generated and significant unobservable input to fair value.

In January 2020, we made a third payment of $

10

 after Lattice AUM reached $

3.0

 billion. Given the dramatic market declines and outflow in March, 2020, Lattice AUM declined to $

2.3

 billion as of March 30, 2020 and the Company reduced the remaining contingent consideration liability to 

zero

, recognizing an $

11.9

 

before tax reduction in expense in first quarter 2020. The earn out period ended on July 29, 2020 with 

no

 additional consideration payable. 

Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs

The Company uses derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified within the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated asset or liability. Therefore, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives reported in the Level 3 rollforward may be offset by realized and unrealized gains and losses of the associated assets and liabilities in other line items of the financial statements.

Write-offs of accrued interest receivable are recorded as a credit loss component of net realized capital gains and losses.

Table of Contents

Note 6 - Investments

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Interest income on fixed maturities and mortgage loans is accrued unless it is past due over 90 days or management deems the interest uncollectible.

Recognition and Presentation of Intent-to-Sell Impairments and ACL on Fixed Maturities, AFS

The Company will record an "intent-to-sell impairment" as a reduction to the amortized cost of fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position if the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the fixed maturity before a recovery in value. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value on the impairment date and the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity before recognizing the impairment.

When fixed maturities are in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not record an intent-to-sell impairment, the Company will record an ACL for the portion of the unrealized loss due to a credit loss. Any remaining unrealized loss on a fixed maturity after recording an ACL is the non-credit amount and is recorded in OCI. The ACL is the excess of the amortized cost over the greater of the Company's best estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows or the security's fair value. Cash flows are discounted at the effective yield that is used to record interest income. The ACL cannot exceed the unrealized loss and, therefore, it may fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity if the fair value is greater than the Company's best estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows. The initial ACL and any subsequent changes are recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. The ACL is written off against the amortized cost in the period in which all or a portion of the related fixed maturity is determined to be uncollectible.

Developing the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain 

internal assumptions regarding the future performance. The Company's considerations include, but are not limited to, (a) changes in the financial condition of the issuer and/or the underlying collateral, (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (c) credit ratings, (d) payment structure of the security and (e) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security.

For non-structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, economic and industry-specific trends and fundamentals, instrument-specific developments including changes in credit ratings, industry earnings multiples and the issuer’s ability to restructure, access capital markets, and execute asset sales.

For structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, various performance indicators such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current and projected delinquency rates, loan-to-value ratios ("LTVs"), average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year, prepayment speeds, and property value declines. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries which may include estimating the underlying collateral value.

Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company recorded an OTTI loss on fixed maturities for which the Company did not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For these securities, the excess of the amortized cost basis over its fair value was separated into the portion representing a credit OTTI, which was recorded in net realized capital losses, and the remaining non-credit amount, which was recorded in OCI. The Company’s best estimate of discounted expected future cash flows became the new cost basis and accreted prospectively into net investment income over the estimated remaining life of the security.

As of December 31, 2020, fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position consisted of 

547

 instruments, primarily in the corporate sectors, most notably travel, leisure, gaming, energy and financial services issuers, and CMBS which were depressed largely due to widening of credit spreads since the purchase date. As of December 31, 2020, 

95

% of these fixed maturities were depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The increase in gross unrealized losses during 2020 was primarily attributable to wider credit spreads within higher yielding corporates and CMBS.

Most of the fixed maturities depressed for twelve months or more relate to the corporate sector. Corporate fixed maturities were primarily depressed because current market spreads are wider than at the respective purchase dates, with certain securities also depressed because of their variable-rate coupons and long-dated maturities. The Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the fixed maturities outlined in the preceding discussion. The decision to record credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS in the form of an ACL requires us to make qualitative and quantitative estimates of expected future cash flows. Given the uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on issuers of these securities, actual cash flows could ultimately deviate significantly from our expectations resulting in realized losses in future periods.

Mortgage Loans

 

ACL on Mortgage Loans

The Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to estimate the ACL with changes in the ACL recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. Apart from an ACL recorded on individual mortgage loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company records an ACL on the pool of mortgage loans based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Company utilizes a third-party forecasting model to estimate lifetime expected credit losses at a loan level under multiple economic scenarios. The scenarios use macroeconomic data provided by an internationally recognized economics firm that generates forecasts of varying economic factors such as GDP growth, unemployment and interest rates. The economic scenarios are projected over 10 years. The first two to four years of the 10-year period assume a specific modeled economic scenario (including moderate upside, moderate recession and severe recession scenarios) and then revert to historical long-term assumptions over the remaining period. Using these economic scenarios, the forecasting model projects property-specific operating income and capitalization rates used to estimate the value of a future operating income stream. The operating income and the property valuations derived from capitalization rates are compared to loan payment and principal amounts to create debt service coverage ratios ("DSCRs") and loan-to-value ratios ("LTVs") over the forecast period. The model overlays historical data about mortgage loan performance based on DSCRs and LTVs and projects the probability of default, amount of loss given a default and resulting expected loss through maturity for each loan under each economic scenario. Economic scenarios are probability-weighted based on a statistical analysis of the forecasted economic factors and qualitative analysis. The Company records the change in the ACL on mortgage loans based on the weighted-average expected credit losses across the selected economic scenarios.

In response to significant economic stress experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 the Company increased the weight of both a moderate and severe recession in our estimate of the ACL. The Company continues to monitor economic uncertainty including rising COVID-19 infections leading to short-term lockdowns and the corresponding impact that this might have on the mortgage loan portfolio.

We expect the impact on our mortgage loan portfolio will be impacted by borrower behavior in response to the economic stress. Borrowers with lower LTVs have an incentive to continue to make payments of principal and/or interest in order to preserve the equity they have in the underlying commercial real estate properties. As property values decline, borrowers have less incentive to continue to make payments.

When a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is probable, the Company measures an ACL on individual mortgage loans. The ACL is established for any shortfall between the amortized cost of the loan and the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Estimates of collectibility from an individual borrower require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability and timing of borrower default and loss severity estimates. In addition, cash flow 

projections may change based upon new information about the borrower's ability to pay and/or the value of underlying collateral such as changes in projected property value estimates. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did 

no

t have any mortgage loans for which an ACL was established on an individual basis.

Prior to January 1, 2020, for mortgage loans that were deemed impaired, a valuation allowance was established for the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value, which was generally the Company's share of the fair value of the collateral. A valuation allowance also may have been recorded for an individual loan or for a group of loans that had an LTV ratio of 90% or greater, a low DSCR or other lower credit quality characteristics. Changes in valuation allowances were recognized as net realized capital losses.

There were 

no

 mortgage loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 

no

 mortgage loans that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract.

 Represents the adjustment to the ACL recorded on adoption of accounting guidance for credit losses on January 1, 2020. For further information refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.

The increase in the allowance for the year-ended December 31, 2020, is the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the economic forecasts, as discussed above, as well as lower estimated property values and operating income as compared to the prior year. 

The weighted-average LTV ratio of the Company’s mortgage loan portfolio was 

55

% as of December 31, 2020, while the weighted-average LTV ratio at origination of these loans was 

60

%. LTV ratios compare the loan amount to the value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan with property values based on appraisals updated no less than annually. Factors considered in estimating property values include, among other things, actual and expected property cash flows, geographic market data and the ratio of the property's net operating income to its value. DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to the borrower’s principal and interest payments and are updated no less than annually through reviews of underlying properties.

Past-Due Mortgage Loans

Mortgage loans are considered past due if a payment of principal or interest is not received according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, which typically includes a grace period. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company held 

no

 mortgage loans considered past due.

Mortgage Servicing

The Company originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans on behalf of third parties and recognizes servicing fee income over the period that services are performed. As of December 31, 2020, under this program, the Company serviced mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal of $

6.9

 billion, of which $

3.7

 billion was serviced on behalf of third parties and $

3.2

 billion was retained and reported in total investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019, the Company serviced mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal balance of $

6.4

 billion, of which $

3.5

 billion was serviced on behalf of third parties and $

2.9

 billion was retained and reported in total investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and were $

0

 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, because servicing fees were market-level fees at origination and remain adequate to compensate the Company for servicing the loans.

Purchased Financial Assets with Credit Deterioration

Purchased financial assets with credit deterioration ("PCD") are purchased financial assets with a “more-than-insignificant” amount of credit deterioration since origination. PCD assets are assessed only at initial acquisition date and for any investments identified, the Company records an allowance at acquisition with a corresponding increase to the amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2020, the Company held 

no

 PCD fixed maturities, AFS or mortgage loans. 

Variable Interest Entities

The Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs primarily as an investor through normal investment activities but also as an investment manager.

A VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments 

162

Note 6 - Investments

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company’s assessment, if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated VIEs

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary.

Non-Consolidated VIEs

The Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is limited to the total carrying value of $

1.3

 billion and $

1.1

 billion, respectively, which are included in limited partnerships and other alternative investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $

768

 and $

851

, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management.

In addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CLOs, CMBS and RMBS and are reported in fixed maturities, available-for-sale. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits and the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment.

Securities Lending, Repurchase Agreements, Other Collateral Transactions and Restricted Investments 

The Company may at times enter into securities financing transactions as a way to earn additional income or manage liquidity, primarily through securities lending and repurchase agreements.

 which are excluded from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Securities Lending

Under a securities lending program, the Company lends certain fixed maturities within the corporate, foreign government/government agencies, and municipal sectors as well as equity securities to qualifying third-party borrowers in return for collateral in the form of cash or securities. For domestic and non-domestic loaned securities, respectively, borrowers provide collateral of 

102

% and 

105

% of the fair value of the securities lent at the time of the loan. Borrowers will return the securities to the Company for cash or securities collateral at maturity dates generally of 

90

 days or less. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, except in the event of default by the counterparty, and is not reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additional collateral is obtained if the fair value of the collateral falls below 

100

% of the fair value of the loaned securities. The agreements are continuous and do not have stated maturity dates and provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities loaned. If cash, rather than securities, is received as collateral, the cash is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income associated with securities lending transactions is reported as a component of net investment income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have any securities on loan as part of a securities lending program.

Repurchase Agreements

From time to time, the Company enters into repurchase agreements to manage liquidity or to earn incremental income. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which one party (transferor) agrees to sell securities to another party (transferee) in return for cash (or securities), with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same securities at a specified price at a later date. The maturity of these transactions is generally ninety days or less. Repurchase agreements include master netting provisions that provide both parties the right to offset claims and apply securities held by them with respect to their obligations in the event of a default. Although the Company has the contractual right to offset claims, the Company's current positions do not meet the specific conditions for net presentation.

Note 6 - Investments

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Under repurchase agreements, the Company transfers collateral of U.S. government and government agency securities and receives cash. For repurchase agreements, the Company obtains cash in an amount equal to at least 

95

% of the fair value of the securities transferred. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred under specified conditions and provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities transferred. The cash received from the repurchase program is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for the repurchase agreements as collateralized borrowings. The securities transferred under repurchase agreements are included in fixed maturities, AFS with the obligation to repurchase those securities recorded in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

From time to time, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements where the Company purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same or substantially the same securities. The maturity of these transactions is generally within one year. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred to the Company under specified conditions and the Company has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities received. The Company accounts for reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing. The receivable for reverse repurchase agreements is included within short-term investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Collateral Transactions

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company pledged collateral of $

34

 and $

37

, respectively, of U.S. government securities and municipal securities or cash primarily related to certain bank loan participations committed to through a limited partnership agreement. These amounts also include collateral related to letters of credit.

For disclosure of collateral in support of derivative transactions, refer to the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives.

Other Restricted Investments

The Company is required by law to deposit securities with government agencies in certain states in which it conducts business. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of securities on deposit was $

2.6

 billion and $

2.3

 billion, respectively. 

In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company held fixed maturities and short-term investments of $

661

 and $

26

, respectively, in trust for the benefit of syndicate policyholders, held fixed maturities of $

175

 in a Lloyd's trust account to provide a portion of the required capital, and maintained other investments of $

54

 primarily consisting of overseas deposits in various countries with Lloyd's to support underwriting activities in those countries. As of December 31, 2019, the Company held fixed maturities and short-term investments of $

447

 and $

189

, respectively, in trust and other investments of $

38

 primarily consisting of overseas deposits in various countries with Lloyd's.

Equity Method Investments

The majority of the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, including hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds (collectively, “limited partnerships”), are accounted for under the equity 

method of accounting. The remainder of investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments consists of investments in insurer-owned life insurance accounted for at cash surrender value. The Company's investment in Hopmeadow Holdings LP is reported in other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For further discussion on Hopmeadow Holdings LP, see Note 22 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations. 

The Company recognized total equity method income of $

244

, $

267

, and $

214

 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Equity method income is reported in net investment income, except amounts related to strategic investments classified in other assets which are reported in other revenues. For investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2020 is limited to the total carrying value of $

2.0

 billion. In addition, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $

804

 to fund limited partnership investments as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in the management.

In 2020, aggregate investment income from investments accounted for under the equity method exceeded 

10

% of the Company’s pre-tax consolidated net income (loss). Accordingly, the Company is disclosing aggregated, summarized financial data for the Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method. This aggregated, summarized financial data does not represent the Company’s proportionate share of investees' assets or earnings. Aggregate total assets of the investees totaled $

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

7. DERIVATIVES

The Company utilizes a variety of OTC, OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivative instruments as a part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions or income generation covered call transactions. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk associated with interest rate, equity market, credit spread, issuer default, price, and currency exchange rate or volatility. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. 

Strategies that Qualify for Hedge Accounting

Some of the Company's derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap. The interest rate swaps are typically used to manage interest rate duration of certain fixed maturity securities or debt instruments issued. 

Cash Flow Hedges

Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on variable-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on 3 month LIBOR + 2.125% junior subordinated debt to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 14 - Debt. 

Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates. 

The Company also previously entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the future purchase of fixed-rate securities, primarily to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain group benefits liabilities.

Non-qualifying Strategies

Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps. In addition, hedges of interest rate, foreign currency and equity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities do not qualify for hedge accounting.

 The non-qualifying strategies include:

Credit Contracts

Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge 

against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty or the Company should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. In addition, the Company enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.

Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures

The Company uses interest rate swaps, swaptions and futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $

7.6

 billion

.

Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards

The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars. The Company may at times enter into foreign currency forwards to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash or equity securities.

Equity Index Options

The Company enters into equity index options to hedge the impact of a decline in the equity markets on the investment portfolio. The Company also enters into covered call options on equity securities to generate additional return. 

Derivative Balance Sheet Classification

For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.

 The following fair value amounts do not include income accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables, which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity. Notional amounts are not necessarily reflective of credit risk.

As of December 31, 2020, the before tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $

35

. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities and long-term debt that will occur over the next twelve months. At that time, the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an 

adjustment to net investment income and interest expense over the term of the investment cash flows.

During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company had 

no

 net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.

Credit Risk Assumed through Credit Derivatives

The Company enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk of a single entity or referenced index in order to synthetically replicate investment transactions that are permissible under the Company's investment policies. The Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security 

issuer’s debt obligation after the occurrence of the credit event. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The credit default swaps in which the Company assumes credit risk primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include standard diversified portfolios of corporate and CMBS issuers. The diversified portfolios of corporate issuers are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches that possess different credit ratings.

ACL on Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances

Premium receivable and agents' balances, excluding receivables for losses within a deductible and retrospectively-rated policy premiums, are primarily comprised of premiums due from policyholders, which are typically collectible within one year or less. The Company had an immaterial amount of receivables with a due date of more than one year that are past-due. Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods.

For these balances, the ACL is estimated based on an aging of receivables and recent historical credit loss and collection experience, adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when appropriate. In response to significant economic stress experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, the Company increased the expected loss factors used to estimate the ACL based on collections experience during past moderate and severe recessions as well as experience during periods when we provided policyholders additional time to make premiums payments.

A portion of the Company's Commercial Lines business is written with large deductibles or under retrospectively-rated plans. Under some commercial insurance contracts with a large deductible, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim and the Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. As such, the Company is subject to credit risk until reimbursement is made. Retrospectively-rated policies are utilized primarily for workers' compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium 

is adjusted based on actual losses incurred. Although the premium adjustment feature of a retrospectively-rated policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it presents credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such policyholders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the amount of additional premium owed under retrospectively-rated policies. The Company manages these credit risks through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and oversight.

The ACL for receivables for loss within a deductible and retrospectively-rated policy premiums is estimated as the amount of the receivable exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each policyholder's credit rating, or a rating is estimated if no external rating is available. Credit ratings are reviewed and updated at least annually. The exposure amount is estimated net of collateral and other credit enhancement, considering the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, and historical loss information for the type of collateral obtained. The probability of default factors are historical corporate defaults for receivables with similar durations estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The loss given default factors are based on a study of historical recovery rates for general creditors through multiple economic cycles. The Company's evaluation of the required ACL for receivables for loss within a deductible and retrospectively-rated policy premiums considers the current economic environment as well as the probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used for estimating the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 6 - Investments. In response to significant economic stress experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, the Company increased the weight of both a moderate and severe recession scenario in our estimate of the ACL for losses within a deductible and retrospectively-rated policy premiums. However, overall, the ACL on receivables for losses within a deductible and retrospectively-rated policy premiums has decreased for the year, primarily due to a decline in the related receivable balance.

9. REINSURANCE 

The Company cedes insurance risk to reinsurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company's procedures include carefully selecting its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where necessary, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers. 

The Company has two adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. One agreement covers substantially all asbestos and environmental ("A&E") reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years ("A&E ADC") and the other covers substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (the Navigators ADC). For more information on ADC agreements, see Note 1 -Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12 -Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.

Reinsurance Recoverables

Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods, generally 30, 60 or 90 days. There were no write-offs for the period ended December 31, 2020.

To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. In placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.

Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral or other credit enhancement, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers.

Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. The ACL is estimated as the amount of reinsurance recoverables exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for the probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each reinsurer's credit rating, or a rating is estimated if no external rating is available. Credit ratings are reviewed on a quarterly basis and any significant changes are reflected in an updated estimate. The probability of default factors are historical insurer and reinsurer defaults for liabilities 

with similar durations to the reinsured liabilities as estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The loss given default factors are based on a study of historical recovery rates for general creditors of corporations through multiple economic cycles or, in the case of purchased annuities funding structured settlements accounted for as reinsurance, historical recovery rates for annuity contract holders.

As shown in the table above, a portion of the total gross reinsurance recoverable balance relates to the Company’s participation in various mandatory (assigned) and voluntary risk pools. Reinsurance recoverables due from pools are backed by the financial position of all insurance companies participating in the pools and the credit backing the reinsurance recoverable is not limited to the financial strength of each pool. The mandatory pools generally are funded through policy assessments or surcharges and if any participant in the pool defaults, remaining liabilities are apportioned among the other members.

The Company's evaluation of the required ACL for reinsurance recoverables considers the current economic environment as well as macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used to estimate the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 6 - Investments. Insurance companies, including reinsurers, are regulated and hold risk-based capital to mitigate the risk of loss due to economic factors and other risks. Non-U.S. reinsurers are either subject to a capital regime substantively equivalent to domestic insurers or we hold collateral to support collection of reinsurance recoverables. As a result, there is limited history of losses from insurer defaults. In response to significant economic stress experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, the Company increased the weight of both a moderate and severe recession in our estimate of the ACL for reinsurance recoverables. The Company expects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to reinsurers to be somewhat mitigated by their regulated capital and liquidity positions.

For its group benefits products, the Company reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements and variations thereto. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements result in passing a 

portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments.

The reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2020 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims 

may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses are also impacted by trends including frequency and severity as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment. In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate settlement of the liabilities gross of reinsurance include inadequate loss development

patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures before reinsurance, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in gross reserves include expanding theories of liabilities and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

2020 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

Workers’ compensation reserves

 were reduced on national account business within middle & large commercial, driven by lower than previously estimated claim severity for the 2015 and prior accident years, including on captives business, and were reduced in small commercial due to lower than expected claim severity for the 2013 to 2018 accident years

.

General liability reserves 

were increased primarily due to a $

254

 increase in reserves for sexual molestation and sexual 

abuse claims related to cases brought against religious and other organizations that were insureds of the Company, partly offset by a decrease in reserves for other mass torts and extra contractual liability claims. The sexual molestation and sexual abuse exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods, which can raise complex coverage issues with significant effects on the ultimate scope of coverage. This increase in reserves reflects an increase in claim incidence largely due to reviver statutes, which is legislation passed in a number of states that provides an opportunity for claimants to file claims for a period of time despite the fact that the original statute of limitations had expired. The reserve increase in 2020 was principally from claims asserted against the Boy Scouts of America (“Boy Scouts”). The reserve increase for Boy Scouts was partially driven by the impact of claim filings on and around the November 16, 2020 deadline to file claims in the Boy Scouts’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Various subsidiaries of the Company issued primary, umbrella and excess general liability policies to the Boy Scouts for various policies periods between 1971 and 1983, including seven years of primary coverage from 1971 through 1977. However, it is the Company’s position that the 1976 and 1977 primary policy years were fully released and all the Company’s obligations extinguished by virtue of a prior settlement agreement with Boy Scouts. Further, the Company disputes the extent of its obligations to Boy Scouts and the validity of certain claims filed against Boy Scouts in the bankruptcy. As such, there are significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate number and severity of the claims against Boy Scouts, the potential for additional reviver activity, and the inherent risks associated with legal determinations to be made by the bankruptcy court and in coverage litigation.

In addition, general liability reserve increases on construction account business were largely offset by decreases in ULAE reserves. Reserves were increased for guaranteed cost construction business for accident years 2014 to 2019 as incurred losses are developing higher than previously expected for premises and operations claims and product liability claims, partly due to a change in industry mix and a heavier concentration of losses in California than initially assumed, as well as increased reserves for middle market and complex liability claims for accident year 2018 largely due to higher than expected severity. Also contributing were increases in reserves on primary layer construction account business within global specialty, mainly related to accident years 2015 to 2017, which is included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table.

Marine reserves 

were increased principally due to an increase in domestic marine liability, mostly in accident years 2017 and 2018 due to a higher number of large losses. The increase in marine reserves is included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table

.

Package business reserves 

decreased for accident years 2014 to 2017 largely due to lower estimates of allocated loss adjustment expenses.

Commercial property reserves

 were decreased for accident year 2019 due to favorable developments on marine and middle market property claims.

Table of Contents

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules

Note 12 - Reserves For Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Professional liability reserves

 were decreased primarily due to lower estimated severity on non-security class action D&O claims and fewer than expected E&O claims with financial institutions for the 2011 to 2018 accident years, partially offset by an increase in D&O reserves for the 2019 accident year driven by higher frequency of class action lawsuits and an increase in large Syndicate D&O losses for the 2016 and 2017 accident years. These Syndicate reserve increases within global specialty are included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table.

Bond reserves

 were

 reduced within contract surety driven by both favorable loss development on the 2015 to 2017 accident years and higher than expected loss recoveries on older accident years

Assumed reinsurance reserves

 were increased for accident year 2018 mostly due to higher accident and health reserve estimates for medical professionals on assumed casualty business. These reserve increases are included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table

.

Automobile liability reserves

 were decreased in Personal Lines principally due to lower than previously expected AARP Direct automobile liability claim severity for the 2017 to 2019 accident years. Automobile liability reserves were increased in Commercial Lines primarily due to higher than expected large losses within middle & large commercial, predominantly within the 2015 to 2019 accident years.

Catastrophes reserves

 were reduced, primarily due to a reduction in estimated reserves for 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and a reduction in estimated catastrophes for wind and hail events in the 2017 to 2019 accident years, partially offset by an increase in reserves for 2019 typhoons Hagibis and Faxai in Asia. The reduction in reserves for the 2017 and 2018 wildfires was largely due to recognizing a $

289

 subrogation benefit in the second quarter of 2020 from PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (together, “PG&E”) as well as a reduction in gross estimated losses on those wildfires.

In December, 2019, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy of PG&E approved an $11 billion settlement of insurance subrogation claims to resolve all such claims arising from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp wildfire. That settlement was contingent upon, among other things, the judge entering an order confirming PG&E’s chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (“PG&E Plan”) incorporating the settlement agreement. On June 20, 2020, the bankruptcy court judge approved the PG&E Plan and PG&E subsequently transferred the $11 billion settlement amount to a trust designed to allocate and distribute the settlement among subrogation holders, including certain of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an estimated $

289

 subrogation benefit though the ultimate amount it collects will depend on how the Company’s ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation compare to other insurers’ ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation.

Uncollectible reinsurance reserves 

were reduced due to higher than expected recoveries from reinsurers in older accident years.

Asbestos and environmental reserves

 were reviewed in fourth quarter 2020 resulting in a $

218

 increase in reserves before ADC reinsurance, including $

127

 for asbestos and $

91

 for environmental. Of the $

218

 increase in A&E reserves, the Company ceded $

220

 to the A&E ADC resulting in a net reserve release of $

2

. Of the $

220

 of adverse development ceded to the A&E ADC, the Company recognized a $

210

 deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance, representing the amount of losses ceded to the ADC in excess of ceded premium paid. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see the Adverse Development Covers section below and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies.

Other reserve re-estimates, net,

 primarily represents an increase in unallocated loss adjustment expense ('ULAE") reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations that was largely driven by an increase in gross asbestos and environmental reserves. 

2019 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

Workers’ compensation reserves 

were reduced, principally in small commercial driven by lower than previously estimated claim severity for the 2014 through 2017 accident years and, to a lesser extent, in national accounts due to lower estimated claim severity, primarily for accident years 2013 and prior.

General liability reserves

 were increased, primarily due to reserve increases in small commercial for accident years 2017 and 2018 due to higher frequency of high-severity bodily injury claims, reserve increases in middle & large commercial for accident years 2015 to 2018 due to higher estimated severity, as well as increased estimated severity on the acquired Navigators Group book of business related to U.S. construction, premises liability, products liability and excess casualty, mostly related to accident years 2014 to 2017. In addition, an increase in reserves for mass torts for 2009 and prior accident years was offset by a decrease in reserves for extra contractual liability claims for more recent accident years, including the 2018 accident year.

Marine reserves 

were increased, principally related to pollution exposure from the 1980s and 1990s related to the Navigators Group book of business.

Package business reserves 

were decreased, primarily due to favorable emergence on property claims related to accident years 2016 through 2018 and due to favorable development of loss adjustment expenses on general liability claims for 2017 and prior accident years.

Commercial property reserves

 were decreased, principally due to favorable emergence of reported losses, including on the acquired Navigators Group book of business, related to offshore energy in accident years 2017 to 2018 and construction engineering across accident years 2015 to 2018.

Professional liability reserves

 

were increased, primarily due to increased securities litigation and large loss activity, including wrongful termination and discrimination claims, related to accident years 2017 and 2018 and increased estimated frequency and severity of directors’ and officers’ reserves on the Navigators Group book of business, principally 

178

Note 12 - Reserves For Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

for the 2014 to 2018 accident years. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in average severity on public company directors’ and officers’ claim reserves and errors and omissions claim reserves for accident years 2014 and prior.

Automobile liability reserves

 were decreased in Personal Lines and increased in Commercial Lines. The decrease in Personal Lines was due to the emergence of lower estimated severity in automobile liability for accident year 2017. The increase in Commercial Lines was due to higher estimated severity on national accounts, principally in accident years 2017 and 2018, and higher estimated severity for accident year 2018 in small commercial and middle market, partially offset by lower estimated severity for 2017 and prior accident years in small commercial and middle market.

Catastrophes reserves

 were reduced, primarily as a result of lower estimated net losses from 2017 hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the 2017 California wildfires. While gross loss reserve estimates for the 2018 California wildfires were also reduced, this was largely offset by a reduction in reinsurance recoverables resulting in very little change to estimated net losses from those wildfires.

Uncollectible reinsurance reserves 

were reduced due to higher than expected recoveries from reinsurers in older accident years.

Other reserve re-estimates, net,

 primarily represents an increase in unallocated loss adjustment expense ('ULAE") reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations that was driven by an increase in gross asbestos and environmental reserves, as well as higher than anticipated ULAE costs in recent years, prompting an increase in the projected ULAE run rate.

2018 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

Workers’ compensation reserves 

were reduced in small commercial and middle market, primarily for accident years 2014 and 2015, as claim severity has emerged favorably compared to previous reserve estimates. Also contributing was a reduction in estimated reserves for ULAE.

General liability reserves 

were increased, primarily due to an increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures in middle market for accident years 2009 to 2017, partially offset by a decrease in reserves for other lines within middle market, including premises and operations, umbrella and products liability, principally for accident years 2015 and prior. Contributing to the increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures was an increase in average claim severity, including from large losses and, in more recent accident years, an increase in claim frequency. Contributing to the reduction in reserves for other middle market lines were more favorable outcomes due to initiatives to reduce legal expenses. In addition, reserve increases for claims with lead paint exposure were offset by reserve decreases for other mass torts and extra-contractual liability claims.

Package business reserves

 were reduced, primarily due to lower reserve estimates for both liability and property for accident years 2010 and prior, including a recovery of loss adjustment expenses for the 2005 accident year.

Commercial property reserves

 were reduced, driven by an increase in estimated reinsurance recoverables on middle market property losses from the 2017 accident year.

Professional liability reserves 

were reduced, principally for accident years 2014 and prior, for directors and officers liability claims principally due to a number of older claims closing with limited or no payment.

Automobile liability reserves

 were reduced, primarily driven by reduced estimates of loss adjustment expenses in small commercial for recent accident years and favorable development in personal automobile liability for accident years 2014 to 2017, principally due to lower severity, including with uninsured and underinsured motorist claims.

Homeowners reserves

 were reduced, primarily in accident years 2013 to 2017, driven by lower than expected severity across multiple perils.

Asbestos and environmental reserves 

were unchanged as $

238

 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2018 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $

238

 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see the Adverse Development Covers section below and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies. 

Catastrophe reserves 

were reduced, primarily as a result of lower estimated net losses from 2017 catastrophes, principally related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Before reinsurance, estimated losses for 2017 catastrophe events decreased by $

133

, resulting in a decrease in reinsurance recoverables of $

90

 as the Company no longer expects to recover under the 2017 Property Aggregate reinsurance treaty as aggregate ultimate losses for 2017 catastrophe events are now projected to be less than $

850

.

Uncollectible reinsurance reserves

 were increased due to lower anticipated recoveries related to older accident years.

Other reserve re-estimates, net,

 primarily represents an increase in ULAE reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations that was principally driven by an increase in expected claim handling costs associated with asbestos and environmental and mass tort claims.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Adverse Development Covers

The Company has an adverse development cover reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reinsure loss development after 2016 on substantially all of the Company’s asbestos and environmental reserves (the “A&E ADC”). Under the A&E ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $

650

 for NICO to assume adverse net loss reserve development up to $

1.5

 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $

1.7

 billion including reserves for A&E exposure for accident years prior to 1986 that are reported in Property & Casualty Other Operations ("Run-off A&E") and reserves for A&E exposure for accident years 1986 and subsequent from policies underwritten prior to 2016 that are reported in ongoing Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The $

650

 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The A&E ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.

Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $

1.5

 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $

650

 reinsurance premium paid have been recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $

650

 reinsurance premium paid result in a deferred gain. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has incurred $

860

 in cumulative adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO with $

640

 of available limit remaining under the A&E ADC. As a result, the Company has recorded a $

210

 deferred gain 

within other liabilities, representing the difference between the reinsurance recoverable of $

860

 and ceded premium paid of $

650

. The deferred gain is recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims will result in charges against earnings, which may be significant. Immediately after closing on the acquisition of Navigators Group, effective May 23, 2019, the Company purchased the Navigators ADC, an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering adverse reserve development, from NICO on behalf of Navigators Insurers. Under the Navigators ADC, the Navigators Insurers paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $

91

 in exchange for reinsurance coverage of $

300

 of adverse net loss reserve development that attaches $

100

 above the Navigators Insurers' existing net loss and allocated loss adjustment reserves as of December 31, 2018 subject to the treaty of $

1.816

 billion for accidents and losses prior to December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a reinsurance recoverable under the Navigators ADC of $

209

 as estimated cumulative loss development on the 2018 and prior accident year reserves of $

309

 exceed the $

100

 deductible. While the reinsurance recoverable is $

209

, the Company has also recorded a $

118

 cumulative deferred gain within other liabilities since, under retroactive reinsurance accounting, ceded losses in excess of the $

91

 of ceded premium paid must be recognized as a deferred gain. Of the $

118

 of cumulative ceded losses in excess of ceded premium paid, $

102

 was recognized as a deferred gain in 2020 and $

16

 was recognized as a deferred gain in 2019. As the Company has ceded $

209

 of the $

300

 available limit, there is $

91

 of remaining limit available as of December 31, 2020.

Asbestos and environmental and other operations include asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures not foreseen when coverages were written, including, but not limited to, potential liability for pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries, lead paint, construction defects, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and other long-tail liabilities. These reserve lines do not have significant paid or incurred loss development for the most recent ten accident years and therefore do not have loss development displayed in triangles.

The reserve lines in the above table and the loss triangles that follow represent the significant lines of business for which the Company regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels. These reserve lines differ from the reserve lines reported on a statutory basis, as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The cumulative incurred losses displayed in the above table include the full reinsurance benefit of ceding $

209

 of losses to the Navigators ADC even though $

118

 of that benefit has been recorded as a deferred gain within other liabilities and recognized as a charge to earnings within incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses included in the consolidated statement of operations. The $

209

 of Navigators Insurers losses ceded to the Navigators ADC included in the following triangles $

53

 for general liability, $

53

 for professional liability, $

24

 for assumed reinsurance, $

12

 for commercial automobile, $

38

 for marine and $

5

 for commercial property and included $

24

 for older accident years and lines of business that are not in the following triangles.

The following loss triangles present historical loss development for incurred and paid claims by accident year, including loss development on Navigators Insurers reserves prior to and after the May 23, 2019 acquisition date. Because the loss triangles include pre-acquisition date changes in ultimate incurred loss 

estimates for Navigators Insurers’ reserves, changes in reserve development evident in the incurred loss triangles may differ from prior accident year development recorded by the Company as shown in the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above as that only includes changes in Navigators Insurers’ reserves post acquisition. In addition, the incurred loss triangles include reserve development on both catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims whereas the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above shows the total amount of catastrophe reserve development across all lines of business on a single line.

Triangles are limited to the number of years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding, not exceeding ten years. Short-tail lines, which represent claims generally expected to be paid within a few years, have three years of claim development displayed. For marine, commercial property, professional liability and assumed reinsurance lines, the Company has provided nine years of claims development as data for earlier periods was not available for the Lloyds syndicate. IBNR reserves shown in loss triangles include reserve for incurred but not reported claims as well as reserves for expected development on reported claims.

IBNR reserves are negative for some accident years as all losses ceded to the Navigators ADC are ceded as IBNR even though the gross losses being ceded include both reported losses and IBNR components. In addition, the collection of subrogation lags payment of the losses.

Property and casualty reserves, including IBNR reserves

The Company estimates ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses by accident year. IBNR represents the excess of estimated ultimate loss reserves over case reserves. The process to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an integral part of the Company's reserve setting. Reserves for allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are generally established separate from the reserves for losses.

Reserves for losses are set by line of business within the reporting segments. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of 

time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.

The Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. 

For both short-tail and long-tail lines of business, an expected loss ratio is used to record initial reserves. This expected loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period. For certain short-tailed lines of business, IBNR amounts in the above loss development triangles are negative due to anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid losses.

As losses for a given accident year emerge or develop in subsequent periods, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more weight vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to as actuarial indications.

Paid development and reported development techniques are used for most lines of business though more weight is given to the reported development method for some of the long-tailed lines like general liability. In addition, for long-tailed lines of business, the Company relies on the expected loss ratio method for immature accident years. Frequency/severity techniques are used predominantly for professional liability and are also used for 

automobile liability. The Berquist-Sherman technique is also used for automobile liability, marine and assumed reinsurance. For most lines, reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE", or those expenses related to specific claims) are analyzed using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments. For most of the lines acquired through the Navigators Group book of business, loss and ALAE are reviewed on a combined basis. Reserves for ULAE are determined using the expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern as well as the ratio of paid ULAE to paid losses.

In the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications. The Company also considers the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves.

Cumulative number of reported claims 

For most property and casualty lines, claim counts represent the number of claim features on a reported claim where a claim feature is each separate coverage for each claimant affected by the claim event. For example, one car accident that results in two bodily injury claims and one automobile damage liability claim would be counted as three claims within the personal automobile liability triangle. Similarly, a fire that impacts one commercial building may result in multiple claim features due to the potential for claims related to business interruption, structural damage, and loss of the physical contents of the building. Claim features that result in no paid losses are included in the reported claim counts. For some property and casualty lines, such as marine and assumed reinsurance, a claim count represents each reported claim regardless of the number of features. For assumed bordereau business and business written on binders, one claim count is posted for each bordereau received, which could account for multiple claims.

2020 re-estimates of prior incurral year reserves

Group disability- 

Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $

365

 largely driven by group long-term disability lower claim incidence and higher recoveries on prior incurral year claims, and a refund on the New York Paid Family Leave program.

Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- 

Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $

65

 largely driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence in group life premium waiver.

Supplemental Accident & Health- 

Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $

15

 driven by lower-than-expected emergence of prior year claims, especially for voluntary critical Illness and voluntary accident products.

2019 re-estimates of prior incurral year reserves

Group disability- 

Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $

340

 largely driven by group long-term disability claim incidence lower than prior assumptions and strong recoveries on prior incurral year claims, including the impact of updating long-term disability ("LTD") recovery probabilities to be based on more recent experience. New York Paid Family Leave also experienced favorable claim emergence including an experience refund.

Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- 

Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $

60

 largely driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence in group life premium waiver.

2018 re-estimates of prior incurral year reserves

Group disability- 

Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $

230

 largely driven by group long-term disability claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions and, primarily for the 2017 incurral year, claim incidence lower than prior assumptions. Short-term disability also experienced favorable claim recoveries. 

Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- 

Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $

90

 largely driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence inclusive of group life, group life premium waiver, and group accidental death & dismemberment, principally for the 2017 incurral year.

Group life, disability and accident reserves, including IBNR

The majority of Group Benefits’ reserves are for LTD claimants who are known to be disabled and are currently receiving benefits. A Disabled Life Reserve ("DLR") is calculated for each 

LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all estimated future benefit payments and includes estimates of claim recovery, investment yield, and offsets from other income, including offsets from Social Security benefits and workers’ compensation. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. The DLR also includes a liability for payments to claimants who have not yet been approved for LTD either because they have not yet satisfied the waiting (or elimination) period or because the approval or denial decision has not yet been made. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability. In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR.

For incurral years with IBNR claims, estimates of ultimate losses are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported or expected depending on the market segment. IBNR represents estimated ultimate losses less both DLR and cumulative paid amounts for all reported claims. Completion factors are derived using standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The IBNR includes an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.

Note 12 - Reserves For Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

For all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and market segment, where emerged claim information for an incurral year is not yet credible enough to be a basis for an IBNR projection. In these cases, the ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio.

The Company also records reserves for future death benefits under group term life policies that provide for premiums to be waived in the event the insured is unable to work due to disability and has satisfied an elimination period, which is typically nine months (premium waiver reserves). The death benefit reserve for these group life premium waiver claims is estimated for a known disabled claimant equal to the present value of expected future cash outflows (typically a lump sum face amount payable at death plus claim expenses) with separate estimates for claimant recovery (when no death benefit is payable) and for death before recovery or benefit expiry (when death benefit is payable). The IBNR for premium waiver death benefits is estimated with standard actuarial development methods.

In addition, the Company also records reserves for group term life, accidental death & dismemberment, short term disability, and other group products that have short claim payout periods. For these products, reserves are determined using paid or reported actuarial development methods. The resulting claim triangles produce a completion pattern and estimate of ultimate loss. IBNR for these lines of business equals the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses less the amount of paid or reported claims depending on whether the paid or reported development method was used. Estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends or other factors that affect the development pattern.

Cumulative number of reported claims

For group life, disability and accident coverages, claim counts include claims that are approved, pending approval and terminated and exclude denied claims. Due to the nature of the claims, one claimant represents one event.

 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on the 6.1% Notes, due 2041.

The effective interest rate on the 6.1% senior notes due 2041 is 

7.9

%. The effective interest rate on the remaining notes does not differ materially from the stated rate. The Company incurred interest expense of $

Shelf Registrations

On May 17, 2019, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-231592) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, guarantees, preferred stock, 

common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. In that The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the 

three

-year life of the registration statement.

Senior Notes

On March 30, 2020, The Hartford repaid at maturity the $

500

 principal amount of its 5.5% senior notes.

In the Navigators Group acquisition, the Company assumed $

265

 par value 5.75% Senior notes due on October 15, 2023 with a fair value of $

284

 as of the acquisition date. 

On August 19, 2019, The Hartford issued $

600

 of 2.8% senior notes (“2.8% Notes”) due August 19, 2029 and $

800

 of 3.6% senior notes (“3.6% Notes”) due August 19, 2049 for net proceeds of approximately $

1.38

 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses. Under both senior note issuances, interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on August 19 and February 19, commencing February 19, 2020. The Hartford, at its option, can redeem the 2.8% Notes and the 3.6% Notes at any time, in whole or part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 

100

% of the principal amount being redeemed or a make-whole amount based on a comparable maturity US Treasury rate plus a basis point spread, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, except the make-whole amount is not applicable within the final three months of maturity for the 2.8% Notes and the final six months of maturity for the 3.6% Notes. The spread over the comparable maturity US Treasury rates for determining the make-whole amount is 

20

 and 

25

 basis points for the 2.8% Notes and 3.6% Notes, respectively.

After receiving proceeds from the issuance of the 2.8% Notes and 3.6% Notes, in third quarter 2019, The Hartford repaid $

265

 of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 that had been assumed in the Navigators Group acquisition and $

Although the original call date was February 15, 2017, a Replacement Capital Covenant associated with the debenture prohibits the Company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to February 15, 2022, unless consent from covered bondholders is obtained.

[5]

In April 2017, the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring 

February 15, 2027

 to effectively convert the interest payments for the 3 Month LIBOR + 2.125% debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 

4.39

%.

The debentures are unsecured, subordinated and junior in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. In addition, the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including obligations to policyholders. The debentures do not limit the Company’s or the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, including debt that ranks senior in right of payment and upon liquidation to the debentures.

The Company has the right to defer interest payments for up to a consecutive ten years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will continue to accrue and will accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate. If the Company defers interest payments, the Company generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of its capital stock or any of its debt securities or guarantees that rank upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up equally with or junior to the debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.

 

The 7.875% and 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debentures may be redeemed in whole prior to the call date upon certain tax or rating agency events, at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may elect to redeem the 7.875% and 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debentures in whole or in part on or after the call date for the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 

In connection with the offering of the 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debenture, the Company entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant ("RCC") for the benefit of holders of one or 

more designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the Company's 4.3% notes due 2043. Under the terms of the RCC, if the Company redeems the debenture any time prior to February 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. The RCC also prohibits the Company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to February 15, 2022. 

In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that, by the end of 2021, it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to report information used to set LIBOR, which could result in LIBOR no longer being published after 2021 or a determination by regulators that LIBOR is no longer representative of its underlying market. In December 2020, based on feedback from the banks that report information used to set LIBOR and following discussions with the FCA, the administrator of LIBOR, ICE Benchmark Administration, released a consultation on the potential for it to continue publication of the most widely-used U.S. dollar LIBOR rates until the end of June 2023. Subject to the results of the consultation, it is possible that some U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will continue to be available for a limited period beyond the end of 2021.The Company continues to monitor and assess the potential impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures.

Revolving Credit Facilities

The Company has a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) that provides up to $750 of unsecured credit through March 29, 2023. Revolving loans from the Credit Facility may be in multiple currencies. U.S. dollar loans will bear interest at a floating rate equivalent to an indexed rate depending on the type of borrowing and a basis point spread based on The Hartford's credit rating and will mature no later than March 29, 2023. Letters of credit issued from the Credit Facility bear a fee based on The Hartford's credit rating and expire no later than March 29, 2024. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, excluding AOCI, of $9 billion, limit the ratio of senior debt to capitalization, excluding AOCI, at 35% and meet other customary covenants. The Credit Facility is for general corporate purposes.

 

As of December 31, 2020, 

no

 borrowings were outstanding, 

no

 letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Lloyd's Letter of Credit Facilities

As a result of the acquisition of Navigators Group, The Hartford had two letter of credit facility agreements: the Club Facility and the Bilateral Facility, which were used to provide a portion of the capital requirements at Lloyd's. As of September 30, 2020, uncollateralized letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $

165

 and £

60

 million, or $

78

, were outstanding under the Club Facility and £

18

 million, or $

23

, was outstanding under the $

25

 Bilateral Facility. These agreements terminated on November 5, 2020.

On November 5, 2020, The Hartford entered into a new committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the “Club Facility”). The Club Facility has two tranches with one tranche extending a $

104

 commitment and the other tranche extending a £

85

 million ($

116

 as of December 31, 2020) commitment. In addition, on November 5, 2020, The Hartford entered into a new non-committed $

25

 credit facility with a lender (the “Bilateral Facility”). The term of both of these facilities is two years. The purpose of these facilities is to issue letters of credit that may be treated as Funds at Lloyd’s to support underwriting capacity provided by the Navigators Corporate Underwriters Limited to the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1221 for the 2021 and 2022 underwriting years of account (and prior open years). As of December 31, 2020, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $

104

 and £

85

 million, or $

116

, were outstanding under the Club Facility and 

no

 letters of credit were outstanding under the Bilateral Facility.

Among other covenants, the Club Facility and Bilateral Facility contain financial covenants regarding The Hartford’s consolidated net worth and financial leverage and that limit the amount of letters of credit that can support Funds at Lloyd’s, consistent with Lloyd’s requirements. As of December 31, 2020, The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants of both facilities.

Commercial Paper

On December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors terminated the HFSG Holding Company's commercial paper program, under which the maximum borrowings available were $

750

.

Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston

The Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and HLA, are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. FHLBB membership required the purchase of member stock and requires additional member stock ownership of 3% or 4% of any amount borrowed. Acceptable forms of collateral include real estate backed fixed maturities and mortgage loans and the amount of advances that can be taken is limited to a percentage of the fair value of the assets that ranges from a high of 97% for US government-backed fixed maturities maturing within 3 years to a low of 40% for A-rated commercial mortgage-backed fixed maturities maturing in 5 years or more. In its consolidated balance sheets, The Hartford presents the liability for advances 

taken based on use of the funds with advances for general corporate purposes presented in short- or long-term debt and advances to earn incremental investment income presented in other liabilities, consistent with other collateralized financing transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements. The Connecticut Department of Insurance permits Hartford Fire and HLA to pledge up to $

1.2

 billion and $

0.6

 billion in qualifying assets, respectively, without prior approval, to secure FHLBB advances in 2021. The pledge limit is determined quarterly based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus of Hartford Fire and HLA, respectively. 

As of December 31, 2020, there were 

no

 advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes liabilities for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated liability at the low end of the range of losses.

Litigation

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties related to sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims discussed in Note 12, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense, and in the following discussion under the caption “COVID-19 Pandemic Business Income Insurance Coverage Litigation” and under the caption “Run-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. In addition to the matter described below, these actions include putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper sales or underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, disability, life and inland marine. The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims or other allegedly unfair or improper business practices. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting, among other things, that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos and that insurers committed unfair trade practices by asserting defenses on behalf of their policyholders in the underlying asbestos cases. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Like many others in the property and casualty insurance industry, beginning in April 2020, various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company (collectively the "Hartford Writing Companies”), and in some instances the Company itself, have been served as defendants in lawsuits seeking insurance coverage under 

commercial insurance policies issued by the Hartford Writing Companies for alleged losses resulting from the shutdown or suspension of their businesses due to the spread of COVID-19. More than 230 such lawsuits have been filed, of which more than 50 purport to be filed on behalf of broad nationwide or statewide classes of policyholders. These lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts in roughly 31 states. Although the allegations vary, the plaintiffs generally seek a declaration of insurance coverage, damages for breach of contract in unspecified amounts, interest, and attorney’s fees. Many of the lawsuits also allege that the insurance claims were denied in bad faith or otherwise in violation of state laws and seek extra-contractual or punitive damages.

The Company and its subsidiaries deny the allegations and intend to defend vigorously. The Hartford Writing Companies maintain that they have no coverage obligations with respect to these suits for business income allegedly lost by the plaintiffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic based on the clear terms of the applicable insurance policies. Although the policy terms vary depending, among other things, upon the size, nature, and location of the policyholder’s business, in general, the claims at issue in these lawsuits were denied because the claimant identified no direct physical damage or loss to property at the insured premises, and the governmental orders that led to the complete or partial shutdown of the business were not due to the existence of any direct physical loss or damage in the immediate vicinity of the insured premises and did not prohibit access to the insured premises, as required by the terms of the insurance policies. In addition, the vast majority of the policies at issue expressly exclude from coverage any loss caused directly or indirectly by the presence, growth, proliferation, spread or activity of a virus, subject to a narrow set of exceptions not applicable in connection with this pandemic, and contain a pollution and contamination exclusion that, among other things, expressly excludes from coverage any loss caused by material that threatens human health or welfare. 

In addition to the inherent difficulty in predicting litigation outcomes, the COVID-19 pandemic business income coverage lawsuits present numerous uncertainties and contingencies that are not yet known, including how many policyholders will ultimately file claims, the number of lawsuits that will be filed, the extent to which any state or nationwide classes will be certified, and the size and scope of any such classes. The legal theories advocated by plaintiffs vary significantly by case as do the state laws that govern the policy interpretation. Many of these lawsuits remain in the earliest stages of litigation, many complaints are in the process of being amended, some have been dismissed voluntarily and may be refiled, while others have been dismissed through rulings in favor of the Hartford Writing Companies. Accordingly, little discovery has occurred. Some policyholders have appealed dismissals in favor of the Hartford Writing Companies; none of these appeals has been fully briefed at this time. In addition, business income calculations depend upon a wide range of factors that are particular to the circumstances of each individual policyholder and, here, virtually none of the plaintiffs have submitted proofs of loss or otherwise quantified or factually supported any allegedly covered loss, and, in any event, the Company’s experience shows that demands for damages often bear little relation to a reasonable estimate of potential

loss. Accordingly, management cannot now reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any. Nonetheless, given the large number of claims and potential claims, the indeterminate amounts sought, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that adverse outcomes, if any, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated operating results. 

Run-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Company continues to receive A&E claims. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs. 

The vast majority of the Company's exposure to A&E relates to Run-off A&E, reported within the P&C Other Operations segment. In addition, since 1986, the Company has written asbestos and environmental exposures under general liability policies and pollution liability under homeowners policies, which are reported in the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. 

Prior to 1986, the Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover A&E claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess and umbrella policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing primary, excess, umbrella and reinsurance coverages. 

Significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid gross losses and expenses related to environmental and particularly asbestos claims. The degree of variability of gross reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for A&E claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to 

the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to A&E claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of A&E claims.

Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for A&E exposures. For this reason, the Company principally relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims, both gross and net of reinsurance, and regularly evaluates new account information in assessing its potential A&E exposures. The Company supplements this exposure-based analysis with evaluations of the Company’s historical direct net loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported experience by calendar and/or report year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity.

While the Company believes that its current A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not estimable now, could be material to The Hartford’s consolidated operating results and liquidity.

For its Run-off A&E, a

s of December 31, 2020, the Company reported $

702

 of net asbestos reserves and $

87

 of net environmental reserves. In addition, the Company has recorded a $

210

 deferred gain within other liabilities for losses economically ceded to NICO but for which the benefit is not recognized in earnings until later periods. While the Company believes that its current Run-off A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit our ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not reasonably estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results and liquidity.

The Company’s A&E ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO reinsures substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years, including Run-off A&E and A&E reserves included in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The A&E ADC has a coverage limit of $

1.5

 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $

1.7

 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has incurred $

860

 in cumulative adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO, leaving $

640

 of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. Cumulative adverse development of A&E claims for accident years 2016 and prior could ultimately exceed

the $

1.5

 billion treaty limit in which case any adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results and liquidity. For more information on the A&E ADC, refer to Note 12, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

.

Unfunded Commitments

As of December 31, 2020, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $

1,119

, of which $

804

 is primarily committed to fund limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. Additionally, $

79

 of the outstanding commitments relate to various funding obligations primarily associated with private debt and equity securities. The remaining outstanding commitments of $

236

 relate to mortgage loans. Of the $

1,119

 in total outstanding commitments, $

149

 are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally.

 

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-Related Assessments

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, the guaranty funds may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent insurers. Assessments are based on each member's proportionate share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to 

one

 or 

two

 percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets, while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process.

Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the liability balance was $

83

 and $

89

, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounts related to premium tax offsets of $

0

 and $

2

, respectively, were included in other assets.

Derivative Commitments

Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and, in certain 

instances, enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2020 was $

86

. For this $

86

, the legal entities have posted collateral of $

90

 in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2020, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. A downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would require an additional $

2

 of assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the additional collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.

Guarantees

 

In the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not expect to make any payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any liabilities associated with these guarantees.

The Hartford has guaranteed the timely payment of contractual claims under certain life, accident and health and annuity contracts issued by its former life and annuity business with most of the guaranteed contracts issued between 1990 and 1997 (the "Talcott Guarantees"). Upon the sale of the life and annuity business in May 2018, the purchaser indemnified the Company for any liability arising under the guarantees. The Talcott Guarantees cover contractual obligations only but otherwise have no limitation as to maximum potential future payments. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company had not recorded a liability because the likelihood of any payment under the Talcott Guarantees is remote. Upon adoption of new credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, the Company estimated a liability for credit loss ("LCL") of $

25

. For further information refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.

The LCL is calculated for the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts multiplied by the probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned by credit rating of the applicable insurance company that issued the contract and is based on historical insurance industry defaults for liabilities with similar durations estimated

through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are current and forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. Because annuities represent the majority of the contracts issued, the loss given default factors are based on a historical study of annuity policyholder recoveries from insolvent estate assets. The Company's exposure is expected to run off over a period that will include more than one economic cycle.

The Company's evaluation of the required LCL for the Talcott Guarantees considers the current economic environment as well 

as macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used to estimate the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 6 - Investments. In response to significant economic stress experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company increased the weight of both a moderate and severe recession scenario in our estimate of the LCL as of December 31, 2020. The Company has never experienced a loss on financial guarantees of this nature and we believe the risk of loss is remote.

EQUITY

 

Capital Purchase Program ("CPP") Warrants

CPP warrants were issued in 2009 as part of a program established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The CPP warrants expired on June 26, 2019.

The declaration of common stock dividends by the Company in excess of a threshold triggered a provision in the Company's warrant agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon resulting in adjustments to the CPP warrant exercise price and the number of shares deliverable for each warrant exercised (“Warrant Share Number”). Accordingly, the CPP warrant exercise price was $

8.836

 and the Warrant Share Number was 

1.1

 as of December 31, 2018. The exercise price was settled by the Company withholding the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants equal to the value of the aggregate exercise price of the warrants so exercised determined by reference to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day on which the warrants were exercised and notice was delivered to the warrant agent. CPP warrant exercises were 

1.9

 million and 

0.3

 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Equity Repurchase Program

The Hartford’s $

1.0

 billion equity repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors in February 2019, expired on December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, The Hartford repurchased $

150

 (

2.7

 million shares) and $

200

 (

3.4

 million shares), respectively, of common stock under this program.

In December, 2020, the Company announced a $

1.5

 billion share repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors which is effective from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022. The timing of any future repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the market price of the Company's securities, the Company's capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company's financial strength or credit ratings, and other considerations.

Preferred Stock

On November 6, 2018, the Company issued 

13.8

 million depositary shares each representing 1/1000th interest in a share of the Company’s 6.0% Series G non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $

25,000

 per share (equivalent to $

25.00

 per depositary share), for net cash proceeds of $

334

. The Preferred Stock is perpetual 

and has no maturity date. Dividends are recorded when declared. Dividends are payable, if declared, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year. If a dividend is not declared and paid or made payable on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for the latest completed dividend period, 

no

 dividends may be paid or declared on The Hartford’s common stock and The Hartford may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock.

The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part, on or after 

November 15, 2023

 at a redemption price of $

25,000

 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period. Prior to November 15, 2023, the Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole but not in part, within 

90

 days of the occurrence of (a) a rating agency event at a redemption price equal to $

25,500

 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a rating agency changes its criteria used to assign equity credit to securities like the Preferred Stock; or (b) a regulatory capital event at a redemption price equal to $

25,000

 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a capital regulator such as a state insurance regulator changes or proposes to change capital adequacy rules.

Statutory Results

The U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford prepare their statutory financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance department which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, recognize a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance within a special surplus account rather than as other liabilities, predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC for life benefit reserves, generally carry bonds at amortized cost, and present reinsurance assets and liabilities net of reinsurance. For reporting purposes, statutory capital and surplus is referred to collectively as "statutory capital".

Regulatory Capital Requirements

The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations. 

Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. 

All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries expect to maintain capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Dividend Restrictions

Dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. Upon the acquisition of Navigators Group, the Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium.

The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 

10

% of the insurer’s statutory policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income 

(or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. 

Property casualty insurers domiciled in New York, including Navigators Insurance Company ("NIC") and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company ("NSIC"), generally may not, without notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner, pay dividends out of earned surplus in any twelve‑month period that exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the most recent financial statement on file, or (ii) 100% of its adjusted net investment income, as defined, for the same twelve month period. As part of the New York state insurance commissioner's approval of the Navigators Group acquisition, and as is common practice, any dividend from NIC and NSIC before May 2021 will require prior approval from the state insurance commissioner. 

Corporate members of Lloyd's Syndicates may pay dividends to its parent to the extent of available profits that have been distributed from the syndicate in excess of the FAL capital requirement. The FAL is determined based on the syndicate’s solvency capital requirement of the syndicate under the Solvency II capital adequacy model, the current regulatory framework governing UK domiciled insurers, plus a Lloyd’s specific economic capital assessment. 

Insurers domiciled in the United Kingdom may pay dividends to its parent out of its statutory profits subject to restrictions imposed under U.K. Company law and Solvency II. Belgium domiciled insurers may only pay dividends if, at the end of its previous fiscal year, the total amount of its assets, as reduced by its provisions and debts, are in excess of certain minimum capital thresholds calculated under Belgian law. 

The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements , liquidity requirements of the individual operating company and are also dependent on the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

In 2020, the Company received $

350

 of dividends from HLA and $

127

 from Hartford Funds. In addition, HFSG Holding Company received $

900

 of net dividends from P&C subsidiaries in 2020 which excludes $

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has utilized all US net operating loss carryforwards as a reduction of 2020 current tax liability. The Company has foreign net operating losses of $

11

 for which a valuation allowance of $

4

 has been established. While the foreign  net operating losses ("NOLs") do not expire, this assessment reflects uncertainty in the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the near term in those specific jurisdictions. 

Management has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based on tax character and jurisdiction. In making the assessment, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of fixed income securities with

market value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.

The entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in the period of the release.

In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recorded a receivable of $

5

 related to a tax indemnification agreement associated with the life and annuity business sold in May 2018. The receivable is separate from the tax liability and is classified in other assets on the balance sheet.

Other Tax Matters

On March 27, 2020, as part of the business stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act. The CARES Act established new tax provisions including, but not limited to: (1) five-year carryback of net operating losses generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020; (2) accelerated refund of alternative minimum tax ("AMT") credit carryforwards; and (3) retroactive changes to allow accelerated depreciation for certain depreciable property.

The legislation results in a benefit of $

6

 related to the ability to carryback non-insurance losses to recover taxes paid in prior years as described below. The changes to AMT recovery periods do not impact the Company due to the fact that the Company has received a refund or reduction of regular tax payable for all the remaining AMT credits in 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recorded a tax benefit of $

11

 related to the expected carryback of losses from the Navigators Group 2019 pre-acquisition tax returns to recover taxes paid in prior years at the previous statutory tax rate of 35%, of which $

6

 was by virtue of the non-insurance carryback provision of the CARES Act. 

Included in 2018 is a benefit of $

39

, primarily due to the elimination of the sequestration fee on alternative minimum tax credits included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA").

For the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recorded a tax benefit of $

8

 related to the excess tax over GAAP basis on the sale of the continental Europe operations. Refer to Note 22 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations.

The federal audits for the Company have been completed through 2013, and the Company is not currently under federal examination for any open years. The statute of limitations is closed through the 2016 tax year with the exception of NOL carryforwards utilized in open tax years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for any potential adjustments that may result from tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.

The Company classifies interest and penalties (if applicable) as income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recognized net interest income of $

1

, $

1

 and $

0

 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company has 

no

 interest payable as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in any open tax years and, therefore, has not recorded any accrual for penalties.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

 

Investment and Savings Plan

Substantially all U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in The Hartford Investment and Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in a variety of 

investments, including up to 

10

% in a fund consisting largely of common stock of The Hartford. The Company's contributions include a non-elective contribution of 

2.0

% of eligible compensation and a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of up to 

6.0

% of eligible compensation contributed by the employee 

212

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

each pay period. The Company also maintains a non-qualified savings plan, The Hartford Excess Savings Plan, with the dollar-for-dollar matching contributions of employee compensation in excess of the amount that can be contributed under the tax-qualified Investment and Savings Plan. An employee's eligible compensation includes overtime and bonuses but for the Investment and Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan combined, is limited to $

1

 annually. The total cost to The Hartford for these plans was approximately $

153

, $

156

 and $

134

 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Additionally, The Hartford has established defined contribution pension plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. The cost to The Hartford for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 for these plans was immaterial.

Post Retirement Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plan- 

The Company maintains The Hartford Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (“Pension Plan”) that covers substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2013. The Company also maintains non-qualified pension plans to provide retirement benefits previously accrued that are in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.

The Pension Plan includes two benefit formulas, both of which are frozen: a final average pay formula (for which all accruals ceased as of December 31, 2008) and a cash balance formula for which benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 2012, although interest will continue to accrue to existing cash balance formula account balances. Employees who were participants as of December 31, 2012 continue to earn vesting credit with respect to their frozen accrued benefits if they continue to work. The interest crediting rate on the cash balance plan is the greater of the average annual yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities or 3.3%. The Hartford Excess Pension Plan II, the Company's non-qualified excess pension benefit plan for certain highly compensated employees, is also frozen.

Group Retiree Health Plan- 

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits are a function of the retiree’s date of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care obligations through a trust fund where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax effective basis. Beginning January 1, 2017, for retirees 65 and older who were participating in the Retiree PPO Medical Plan, the Company funds the cost of medical and dental health care benefits through contributions to a Health Reimbursement Account and covered individuals can access a variety of insurance plans from a health care exchange. Effective January 1, 2002, Company-subsidized retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or after January 1, 2002. The Company also amended its postretirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage plans to no longer provide subsidized coverage for employees who retired on or after January 1, 2014. 

Assumptions

Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations to employees 

under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement expense under the defined benefit pension plan and group retiree health plan are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed discount rates and yield curve is based on high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. Based on all available market and industry information, it was determined that 

2.65

% and 

2.36

% were the appropriate discount rates as of December 31, 2020 to calculate the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively. 

The expected long-term rate of return considers the actual compound rates of return earned over various historical time periods. The Company also considers the investment volatility, duration and total returns for various time periods related to the characteristics of the pension obligation, which are influenced by the Company's workforce demographics. In addition, for the pension plan, the Company anticipates an allocation of approximately 

60

% in fixed income securities and 

40

% in non fixed income securities (global equities, hedge funds and private market alternatives) to derive an expected long-term rate of return. For the other post-retirement plans, the Company anticipates an allocation of approximately 

70

% in fixed income securities and 

30

% in non fixed income securities. Based upon these analyses, management determined the long-term rate of return assumption to be 

6.00

% and 

5.60

% for the Company's pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 

6.45

% and 

6.00

% for the Company's pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. To determine the Company's 2021 expense, the Company has assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 

5.40

% and 

4.90

% for the Company's pension and other post retirement obligations, respectively.

Such assets are available to the Company’s general creditors in the event of insolvency. The rabbi trust assets consist of equity and fixed income investments. To the extent the fair value of these rabbi trusts were included in the table above, pension plan assets would have been $

Pension Plan Assets

Investment Strategy and Target Allocation

The overall investment strategy of the Pension Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the Pension Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and guidelines are being followed. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Pension Plan.

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges.

The Pension Plan invests in commingled funds and partnerships managed by unaffiliated managers to gain exposure to emerging markets, equity, hedge funds and other alternative investments. These portfolios encompass multiple asset classes reflecting the current needs of the Pension Plan, the investment preferences and risk tolerance of the Pension Plan and the desired degree of diversification. These asset classes include publicly traded equities, bonds and alternative investments and are made up of individual investments in cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, debt securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage loans and hedge funds. Hedge fund investments represent a diversified portfolio of partnership investments in a variety of strategies.

In addition, the Company uses U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts and U.S. Treasury STRIPS in a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of Pension Plan assets to better match the duration of the benefit obligation.

Investments that are measured at net asset value per share or an equivalent and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. 

The tables below provide fair value level 3 rollforwards for the Pension Plan Assets for which significant unobservable inputs ("Level 3") are used in the fair value measurement on a recurring basis. The Pension Plan classifies the fair value of financial instruments within Level 3 if there are no observable markets for 

the instruments or, in the absence of active markets, if one or more of the significant inputs used to determine fair value are based on the Pension Plan’s own assumptions. Therefore, the gains and losses in the tables below include changes in fair value due to both observable and unobservable factors.

Concentration of Risk

In order to minimize risk, the Pension Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the Pension Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality 

requirements imposed on permissible investment options. Permissible investments include U.S. equity, international equity, alternative asset and fixed income investments including derivative instruments. Permissible derivative instruments include futures contracts, options, swaps, currency forwards, caps or floors and may be used to control risk or enhance return but will not be used for leverage purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Securities specifically prohibited from purchase include, but are not limited to: shares or fixed income instruments issued by The Hartford, short sales of any type within long-only portfolios, non-derivative securities involving the use of margin, leveraged floaters and inverse floaters, including money market obligations, natural resource real properties such as oil, gas or timber and precious metals.

Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Pension Plan does not have any material exposure to any concentration risk of a single issuer.

Expected Employer Contributions

The Company does not have a 2021 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021.

 The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2021 to make this determination.

20. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS 

The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below. Shares issued in satisfaction of stock-based compensation may be made available from authorized but unissued shares, shares held by the Company in treasury or from shares purchased in the open market. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued shares from treasury in satisfaction of stock-based compensation

.

Stock-based compensation expense, included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, was as follows:

The Company did not capitalize any cost of stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2020, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $

68

, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 

2

 years.

In the second quarter of 2018, The Hartford modified the terms of the portion of its outstanding 2016 and 2017 performance share awards that are based on actual versus targeted return on equity over the performance period. The modification eliminated the benefit to return on equity that arose from the charge against earnings in 2017 driven by the effect of the lower corporate income tax rate on the carrying value of net deferred tax assets. 

This modification had 

no

 impact on compensation cost recognized over the vesting period since compensation cost based on the original performance share conditions is projected to be higher than what the cost would be based on the performance share conditions as modified.

Stock Plan 

Future stock-based awards may be granted under The Hartford's 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Incentive Plan") other than the Subsidiary Stock Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described below. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units, or any other form of stock-based award. The maximum number of shares, subject to adjustments set forth in the 2020 Stock Plan, that may be issued to Company employees and third-party service providers during the 

10

-year duration of the Stock Incentive Plan is the sum of 

11,250,000

 shares, any shares cancelled subsequent to February 29, 2020, plus any shares used for tax withholding purposes. If any award under an earlier incentive stock plan is forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expires unexercised, or is settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the net issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number subject to the award, the shares of stock subject to such award (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for awards under the Stock Incentive Plan and such shares shall be added to the maximum limit. As of December 31, 2020, there were 

11,735,111

 shares available for future issuance.

The fair values of awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan are measured as of the grant date and expensed ratably over the awards’ vesting periods, generally 

3

 years. For stock option awards to retirement-eligible employees the Company recognizes the expense over a period shorter than the stated vesting period because the employees receive accelerated vesting upon retirement and therefore the vesting period is 

219

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules

Note 20 - Stock Compensation Plans

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

considered non-substantive. Beginning with awards granted in 2017, employees with restricted stock units and performance shares receive accelerated vesting upon meeting certain retirement eligibility criteria.

Stock Option Awards

Under the Stock Incentive Plan, options granted have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is not to exceed 

10

 years. Options generally become exercisable over a period of 

three years

 commencing 

one year

 from the date of grant. Certain other options become exercisable at the later of 

three years

 from the date of grant or upon specified market appreciation of the Company's common shares.

The Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “Plan Valuation Model”) that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The Plan Valuation Model also incorporates the Company’s historical termination and exercise experience to determine the option value.

The Plan Valuation Model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and those ranges are disclosed below. The term structure of volatility is generally constructed utilizing implied volatilities from exchange-traded options, CPP warrants related to the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the Plan Valuation Model, and accommodates variations in employee preference and risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts and conducting a fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option Plan Valuation Model and represents, in a mathematical sense, the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Share Awards

Share awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan and outstanding include restricted stock units and performance shares. 

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units are share equivalents that are credited with dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid in incremental shares when the underlying units vest. Restricted stock are shares of The Hartford's common stock with

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

restrictions as to transferability until vested. Restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are valued equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Generally, restricted stock units vest at the end of or over 

three years

; certain restricted stock units vest at the end of 

five years

. Beginning in 2017, restricted stock units vest at the earlier of an employee's retirement eligibility date or 

three years

. Equity awards granted to non-employee directors generally vest in 

one year

 and were made in the form of restricted stock units in 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Performance Shares

Performance shares become payable within a range of 

0

% to 

200

% of the number of shares initially granted based upon the attainment of specific performance goals achieved at the end of or over 

three years

. While most performance shares vest at the end of or over 

three years

, certain performance shares vest at the end of 

five years

. Beginning in 2017, performance shares vest at the earlier of an employee's retirement eligibility date or three years.

Performance share awards granted prior to 2020 that are not dependent on market conditions are valued equal to the market 

price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant less a discount for the absence of dividends. Performance share awards granted in 2020 that are not dependent on market conditions are valued equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Stock-compensation expense for these performance share awards without market conditions is based on a current estimate of the number of awards expected to vest based on the performance level achieved and, therefore, may change during the performance period as new estimates of performance are available.

Other performance share awards or portions thereof have a market condition based upon the Company's total stockholder return relative to a group of peer companies within a period of 

three years

 from the date of grant. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and, therefore, does not change for changes in estimated performance. The Company uses a risk neutral Monte-Carlo Plan Valuation Model that incorporates time to maturity, implied volatilities of the Company and the peer companies, and correlations between the Company and the peer companies and interest rates.

 and $

 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the subsidiary stock plan. Upon employee vesting of subsidiary stock, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling equity interest. Employees are restricted from selling vested subsidiary stock to anyone other than the Company and the Company has discretion on the amount of stock to repurchase. Therefore, the subsidiary stock is classified as equity because it is not mandatorily redeemable. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased $

10

 in subsidiary stock.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company sponsors The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this plan, eligible employees of The Hartford purchase common stock of the Company at a discount rate of 

5

% of the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period. Accordingly, the plan is a non-compensatory plan. Employees purchase a variable number of shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 

15,400,000

 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2020, there were 

3,743,847

 shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 

340,653

 shares, 

213,472

 shares, and 

219,661

 shares were sold, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $

BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

 

Sale of life and annuity business

On May 31, 2018, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hartford Holdings, Inc, completed the sale of its life and annuity business to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group. Under the terms of the sale agreement signed December 3, 2017, the investor group formed a limited partnership, Hopmeadow Holdings LP, that acquired HLI, and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, for cash of approximately $

1.4

 billion after a pre-closing dividend to The Hartford of $

300

. The Hartford received a 

9.7

% ownership interest in the limited partnership, valued at a cost of $

164

 as of the sale date. In addition, as part of the terms of the sale agreement, The Hartford reduced its long-term debt by $

142

 because the debt, which was issued by HLI, was included as part of the sale. Including cash proceeds and the retained equity interest and net of transaction costs, net proceeds for the sale were approximately $

1.5

 billion. The life and annuity operations met the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations and are reported in the Corporate category through the date of sale.

After having recognized a loss on sale within discontinued operations of approximately $3.3 billion in 2017, the Company recognized a reduction in loss on sale of $

202

 in 2018. The reduction in loss on sale in 2018 primarily resulted from the reclassification to retained earnings of $

193

 of tax effects stranded in AOCI due to the accounting for Tax Reform and a $

141

 increase in estimated retained tax benefits, primarily net operating loss carryovers, partially offset by $

104

 of operating income from discontinued operations during the period up until the closing date and a reclassification of $

10

 of net unrealized capital gains from AOCI to retained earnings. See Note 1 - Adoption of New Accounting Standards within Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information about the reclassifications from AOCI to retained earnings. The estimated amount of retained net operating loss carryovers depends on the estimated tax basis of the business sold which increased subsequent to the date the Company entered into the sale agreement. At closing, stockholders’ equity was further reduced for the amount of AOCI of the life and annuity business, which was approximately $

758

, largely consisting of net unrealized gains on investments, net of shadow DAC. 

Cash inflows and outflows from and to the life and annuity business after closing were immaterial to the overall inflows and 

outflows of the Company. Additionally, the revenues and expenses presented in continuing operations related to pre-disposal operations were immaterial.

The Company has been managing invested assets of the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 for an initial term of 

five years

 and provided transition services through February, 2020. 

The Hartford reported its 9.7% ownership interest in Hopmeadow Holdings LP, which is accounted for under the equity method, in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The Hartford recognizes its share of income in other revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations on a three month delay, when financial information from the investee becomes available. The Company recognized $

42

 and $

66

, before tax, of income in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash inflows for dividends received from Hopmeadow Holdings LP were $

30

 and $

67

, respectively. Other cash inflows and outflows from and to the life and annuity business after closing were immaterial to the overall inflows and outflows of the Company.

Sale of Continental Europe Operations

On September 30, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Continental Europe Operations. The transaction is expected to close by the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The complete sale of the Continental Europe Operations consists of multiple arrangements designed as a single transaction. The assets and liabilities of the Continental Europe Operations have been classified as held for sale in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.

Total consideration less costs to sell is estimated to be 

approximately $

14

, resulting in an estimated loss on the sale of approximately $

48

, before tax, which has been recorded within net realized capital gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The 

Company also recorded related income tax benefits of $

18

, for an estimated after tax loss of $

30

 on the sale, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The accrual for the estimated before tax loss is included as a reduction of the carrying value of assets held for sale in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020. The Continental Europe Operations are reported under the Commercial Lines segment. The estimate of consideration less costs to sell of $

14

 includes an estimate of consideration that is contingent on how the ultimate amounts required to settle claims on 2020 and prior accident years, as determined at the end of 2024, compare with recorded reserves as currently estimated. The contingent consideration has been estimated at its fair value of $

12

 and could increase or decrease depending on how ultimate losses develop. Any change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration in a future period would increase or decrease the estimated loss on sale in that period.

 was based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and $

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER COSTS

In recognition of the need to become more cost efficient and competitive along with enhancing the experience we provide to agents and customers, on July 30, 2020 the Company announced an operational transformation and cost reduction plan it refers to as Hartford Next. Hartford Next is intended to reduce annual insurance operating costs and other expenses through reduction of the Company's headcount, investment in information technology ("IT") to further enhance our capabilities, and other activities. The activities are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2022.

Termination benefits related to workforce reductions and professional fees are included within restructuring and other 

costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and unpaid restructuring costs are included in other liabilities in the December 31, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company expects to incur additional costs including, amortization of right of use assets and other lease exit costs, other IT costs to retire applications, professional fees and other expenses. Total restructuring and other costs are expected to be approximately $

158

, before tax, and will be recognized in Corporate for segment reporting.
