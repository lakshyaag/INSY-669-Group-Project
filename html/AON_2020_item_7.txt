>Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS

Aon is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions underpinned by proprietary data and analytics. Management continues to lead its set of initiatives designed to strengthen Aon and unite the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by proprietary data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.

Financial Results 

The following is a summary of our 2020 financial results from continuing operations:

•

Revenue increased $53 million, or 0%, to $11,066 million in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting 1% organic revenue growth, offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by strength in the core portions of the business, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions.

•

Operating expenses decreased $559 million, or 6%, to $8,285 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a $451 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $138 million decrease from accelerated amortization related to certain tradenames that were fully amortized in the second quarter, expense discipline in an effort to proactively manage liquidity due to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on the Company, including lower travel and entertainment expense, and a $42 million favorable impact from translating prior year period results at current period foreign exchange rates (“foreign currency translation”), partially offset by $123 million of transaction costs related to the pending combination with WTW and a $37 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures.

•

Operating margin increased to 25.1% in 2020 from 19.7% in 2019. The increase in operating margin from the prior year is primarily driven by organic revenue growth of 1% and a decrease in operating expenses as listed above.

•

Due to the factors set forth above, net income from continuing operations was $2,017 million in 2020, an increase of $443 million, or 28%, from 2019. 

•

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $8.45 per share during the twelve months of 2020 compared to $6.37 per share for the prior year period.

•

Cash flows provided by operating activities was $2,783 million in 2020, an increase of $948 million, or 52%, from $1,835 million in 2019, 

primarily due to working capital improvements, including improved collections and actions taken to proactively manage liquidity, a $288 million decrease in restructuring cash outlays, and strong operational improvement. Th

e prior year period included approximately $130 million of net cash payments related to legacy litigation.

We focus on four key non-GAAP metrics that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth (decline), adjusted operating margins, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flows. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics from continuing operations for 2020:

•

Organic revenue growth (decline), a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth (Decline),” was 1% in 2020, compared to 6% organic growth in the prior year. Organic revenue growth was driven by strength in the core portions of our business, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions.

•

Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 28.5% in 2020, compared to 27.5% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects expense discipline, including lower travel and entertainment expense, increased operating leverage across the portfolio, and 1% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $47 million decrease in fiduciary investment income and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $12 million.

30

•

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $9.81 per share in 2020, an increase of $0.64 per share, or 7%, from $9.17 per share in 2019. The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily reflects strong operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $1.8 billion of share repurchase during 2020, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.

•

Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $2,642 million in 2020, an increase of $1,032 million, or 64%, from $1,610 million in 2019, driven by an increase of $948 million in cash flows from operations and a $84 million decrease in capital expenditures. The prior year included $75 million of capital expenditures related to the restructuring program.

IRELAND REORGANIZATION

For a description of the Ireland Reorganization, see Part I, Item 1. “Business - Ireland Reorganization” in this report.

BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT

On March 9, 2020, Aon and WTW, entered into a Business Combination Agreement with respect to a combination of the parties. At the effective date of the Combination, WTW shareholders will be entitled to receive 1.08 newly issued Class A ordinary shares of Aon in exchange for each ordinary share of WTW held by such holders. The Combination is subject to Irish Takeover Rules. The Business Combination Agreement contains certain operating covenants relating to the conduct of business of both parties in the interim period until the transaction is completed. These covenants require both parties to operate their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. In addition, these covenants restrict each party from engaging in certain actions unless a party obtains the prior written consent of the other party. These actions relate to, among other things, authorizing or paying dividends above a specified rate; issuing or authorizing for issuance additional securities; salary, benefits or other compensation and employment-related matters; capital management, debt and liquidity matters; engaging in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions; entering into or materially modifying material agreements; entering into material litigation-related settlements; and making other corporate, tax and accounting changes. The parties’ respective shareholders approved the Combination on August 26, 2020. On October 30, 2020, Aon and WTW amended the Business Combination Agreement to provide that, at the effective date of the transaction, there will be 12 members of Aon’s Board of Directors, including one director mutually agreed by the parties.

The parties continue to work with regulators, including the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (which, as previously disclosed, has delivered a “Second Request” pursuant to the HSR Act) and the European Commission (which, as previously disclosed, has initiated a Phase II review of the Combination) to obtain the required approvals to close the Combination. Aon expects to close the Combination in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

The outbreak of the coronavirus, COVID-19, was declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic and has continued to spread across the globe, impacting almost all countries, in varying degrees, creating significant public health concerns, and significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate. While countries are in various stages of business and travel restrictions to address the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as related re-openings, these policies have impacted and will continue to impact worldwide economic activity and may continue to adversely affect our business. We continue to closely monitor the situation and our business, liquidity, and capital planning initiatives. We continue to be fully operational and continue to reoccupy certain offices in phases, where deemed appropriate and in compliance with governmental restrictions considering the impact on health and safety of our colleagues, their families, and our clients. For other areas where restrictions remain in place or where we have started to see a resurgence of COVID-19, we are closely monitoring the situation and continuously reevaluating our plan to return to the workplace. We continue to deploy business continuity protocols to facilitate remote working capabilities to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues and to comply with public health and travel guidelines and restrictions. 

As the situation continues to evolve, and the scale and duration of disruption cannot be predicted, it is not possible to quantify or estimate the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business. We are focused on navigating these challenges and potential future impacts to our business presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking proactive steps to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs and support a commitment to no layoffs of our colleagues due to COVID-19. Such actions include, but are not limited to, issuing $1 billion of our new 10-year senior unsecured notes on May 12, 2020 and using the proceeds to repay short-term debt and for other corporate purposes, and reducing our discretionary spending, including limiting discretionary spending on mergers and acquisitions. We also temporarily suspended our share buyback program and temporarily reduced compensation for named executive officers, 

31

directors, and colleagues during the second quarter, as a precautionary measure, focusing on implementing cash and expense discipline measures. After carefully monitoring the situation, we determined it was appropriate, based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance, to resume share buyback during the third quarter. In addition, temporarily reduced salaries for non-executives were restored at the end of the second quarter and withheld salaries, plus 5% of the withheld salary amounts, were repaid in the third quarter. Temporarily reduced salaries for named executive officers and cash compensation reductions for non-executive directors were fully reinstated and the withheld amounts were paid in full during the fourth quarter. 

While the ultimate public health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our net revenues, earnings, and cash flows, will be adversely impacted, depending on the duration and severity of the downturn, as well as governmental or other regulatory policies and actions that may impact our business or operations. Our revenues can be generalized into two categories: core and more discretionary arrangements. Core revenues tend to be highly-recurring and non-discretionary, where the services are typically regulated, required, or necessary costs of managing the risk of doing business. As expected, in the fourth quarter of 2020 our core revenues did not experience a significant decrease due to the impacts of COVID-19; however, if the economic downturn becomes more severe, we expect that certain services within our core business may be negatively impacted as well. More discretionary revenues tend to include project-related services, where as expected, in the fourth quarter of 2020 we saw an impact from decreases in revenue due to the impacts of COVID-19. The impacts of the pandemic on our business operations and results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 are further described in the section entitled “Review of Consolidated Results” and “Liquidity and Financial Condition” contained in Part II, Item 7 of this report.

Consolidated Results for 2020 Compared to 2019 

Revenue

Total revenue increased $53 million, or 0%, to $11,066 million in 2020, compared to $11,013 million in 2019. The increase was driven by 1% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions. Organic revenue growth for the year was driven by strength in the core portions of the business, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions.

Commercial Risk Solutions

 revenue increased $17 million, or less than 1%, to $4,690 million in 2020, compared to $4,673 million in 2019. Organic revenue growth was 3% in 2020, driven by growth across most major geographies, including solid growth in the U.S. and Canada and double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by strong retention and management of the renewal book portfolio, partially offset by a decline in the more discretionary portions of our book globally. On average globally, exposures and pricing were both modestly positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact overall.

Reinsurance Solutions 

revenue increased $128 million, or 8%, to $1,814 million in 2020, compared to $1,686 million in 2019. Organic revenue growth was 10% in 2020 driven by double-digit growth in treaty and in facultative placements, reflecting continued net new business generation. In addition, market impact was modestly positive on results.

33

Retirement Solutions 

revenue decreased $64 million, or 4%, to $1,753 million in 2020, compared to $1,817 million in 2019. Organic revenue decline was 2% in 2020 driven primarily by a decline in Human Capital for rewards and assessment services and a modest decline in the discretionary portions of Retirement and Investments, partially offset by growth in the core portions of Retirement and Investments.

Health Solutions 

revenue decreased $12 million, or 1%, to $1,655 million in 2020, compared to $1,667 million in 2019. Organic revenue decline was 1% in 2020 driven by a decrease primarily related to COVID-19, including a reduction primarily reflecting the annualized impact of lower employment levels and lower renewals, and a decline in the more discretionary portions of the business. Results were further negatively impacted by a one-time adjustment of $16 million related to revenue that was recorded across multiple years and was identified in connection with the implementation of a new system, partially offset by growth internationally.

Data & Analytic Services 

revenue decreased $13 million, or 1%, to $1,171 million in 2020, compared to $1,184 million in 2019. Organic revenue decline was 5% in 2020 driven by a decrease in the travel and events practice globally.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits decreased $149 million, or 2%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $205 million decrease in restructuring charges and a $26 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a $17 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures, and an increase in expense associated with 1% organic revenue growth.

Information Technology

Information technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, decreased $50 million, or 10%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $39 million decrease in restructuring charges and expense discipline.

Premises

Premises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, decreased $48 million, or 14%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $33 million decrease in restructuring charges and a decrease related to reduced office occupancy.

Depreciation of Fixed Assets

Depreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and automobiles. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $5 million, or 3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $14 million decrease in restructuring charges.

Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets 

Amortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived tradenames and customer-related, contract-based, and technology assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased $146 million, or 37%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $138 million decrease from accelerated amortization related to certain tradenames that were fully amortized in the second quarter.

Other General Expenses

Other general expenses decreased $161 million, or 12%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $160 million decrease in restructuring charges and a temporary reduction of certain expenses, primarily travel and entertainment, partially offset by $123 million of transaction costs related to the pending combination with WTW and a $13 million increase in expenses related to acquisitions, net of divestitures.

Interest Income

Interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $6 million in 2020, a decrease of $2 million, or 25%, from 2019, reflecting the currency composition of operating cash.

Interest Expense

Interest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $334 million in 2020, an increase of $27 million, or 9%, from 2019. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt balances.

34

Other Income (Expense)

Total other income was $12 million in 2020, compared to other income of $1 million in 2019. Other income in 2020 primarily includes a $25 million gain on the sale of certain businesses, $13 million of pension and other postretirement income, and $4 million of equity earnings, partially offset by $12 million of losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, $11 million of losses on financial instruments used to economically hedge gains and losses from changes in foreign exchange rates, and $7 million of expense related to the prepayment of $600 million Senior Notes due September 2020. Other income in 2019 primarily includes a $13 million gain on the sale of  certain businesses, $9 million of gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, $9 million of pension and other postretirement income, and $4 million of equity earnings, partially offset by $34 million of losses on financial instruments used to economically hedge gains and losses from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

Due to factors discussed above, income from continuing operations before income taxes was $2,465 million in 2020, a 32% increase from $1,871 million in 2019. 

Income Taxes from Continuing Operations

The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 18.2% in 2020 and 15.9% in 2019. The primary driver of the 2020 tax rate is the geographical distribution of income, as well as net favorable discrete items including the impact of share-based payments.

The 2019 tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income including restructuring charges, as well as net favorable discrete items including the impact of share-based payments.

Net Income from Discontinued Operations

Net income from discontinued operations was $1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $1 million in 2019.

Net Income Attributable to Aon Shareholders

Net income attributable to Aon shareholders increased to $1,969 million, or $8.45 per diluted share, in 2020, compared to $1,532 million, or $6.37 per diluted share, in 2019.

Consolidated Results for 2019 Compared to 2018

We have elected not to include a discussion of our consolidated results for 2019 compared to 2018 in this report in reliance upon Instruction 1 to Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K. This discussion can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on February 14, 2020.

Non-GAAP Metrics

In our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth (decline), adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.

35

Organic Revenue Growth (Decline)

We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth (decline) to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth (decline) is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth (decline) represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages):

Adjusted Operating Margin

We use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the fourth quarter of 2019 we settled legacy litigation that had been reported in a prior year as an adjustment to GAAP earnings. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a $13 million charge in 2019, which represents the difference between the amount accrued in the prior year and the final settlement amount of the legacy litigation.

(3)

Certain transaction costs associated with the Combination will be incurred prior to the expected completion of the Combination in the first half of 2021. These costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees required to complete the Combination.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share

We use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above, along with pension settlements and related income taxes, because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Free Cash Flow

We use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations

Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between 

39

periods by translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates. 

Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.03 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2020. Currency fluctuations had a $0.19 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2019, when 2018 results were translated at 2019 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.08 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018, when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates. 

Translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates, currency fluctuations had a $0.04 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2020. Currency fluctuations had a $0.23 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2019, when 2018 results were translated at 2019 rates. Currency fluctuations had a $0.09 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2018, when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates. These translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity

Executive Summary

We believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operations, available cash reserves, and debt capacity available under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, shareholder dividends, and 

restructuring activities

. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements over the long-term.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken various proactive steps and continue to evaluate opportunities that will increase our liquidity and strengthen our financial position. Such actions include, but are not limited to, issuing $1 billion of 10-year senior unsecured notes on May 12, 2020 and using the proceeds to repay short-term debt and for other corporate purposes, and reducing our discretionary spending, including limiting discretionary spending on mergers and acquisitions. We also temporarily suspended our share buyback program and temporarily reduced compensation for named executive officers, directors, and colleagues during the second quarter, as a precautionary measure to protect our liquidity, focusing on implementing cash and expense discipline measures. After carefully monitoring the situation, we determined it was appropriate, based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance, to resume share buyback during the third quarter. In addition, temporarily reduced salaries for non-executives were restored at the end of the second quarter and withheld salaries, plus 5% of the withheld salary amounts, were repaid in the third quarter. Temporarily reduced salaries for named executive officers and cash compensation reductions for non-executive directors were fully reinstated and the withheld amounts were paid in full during the fourth quarter.

We expect to have the ability to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months and beyond through the use of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, funds available under our credit facilities and commercial paper programs, and cash flows from operations. Short-term investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash, as deemed appropriate. In the second quarter, we issued $1 billion in 2.80% Senior Notes due May 2030, from which a portion of the proceeds were used to repay our $600 million 5.00% senior notes in June 2020, which were scheduled to mature in September 2020. Additionally, in the third quarter, Aon Global Holdings plc established the European Commercial Paper Program for €625 million, subsequently the previous European Commercial Paper Program, established by Aon Global Limited for €525 million, was withdrawn in the quarter, increasing the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the European program by €100 million. In February of 2021 we repaid the $400 million 2.80% Senior Notes that were due to mature in March 2021, which further reduced our debt obligations.

We believe our liquidity position at December 31, 2020 remains strong as evidenced by strong cash flows in the quarter and significant cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances. Given the significant uncertainties of economic conditions due to COVID-19, we will continue to closely monitor and actively manage our liquidity as economic conditions change.

Cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance 

40

premiums and claims in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities. 

In our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Our Fiduciary assets included cash and short-term investments of $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $8.1 billion and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes.

We maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2020, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities may have been negative; however, the overall balance was positive.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased $948 million, or 52%, from the prior year to $2,783 million. This amount represents net income reported, as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of receivables.

Pension Contributions

Pension contributions were $120 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $135 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. In 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $122 million in cash to our pension plans, including contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Investing Activities

Cash flows used for investing activities in continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $679 million, an increase of $450 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for 

41

investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments increased $170 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. As disclosed in Note 15 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.

Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses

During 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of six businesses for consideration of $368 million, net of cash acquired, and the disposition of one businesses for a $30 million cash inflow, net of cash sold.

During 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of three businesses for consideration of $39 million, net of cash acquired, and the disposition of eight businesses for a $52 million cash inflow, net of cash sold.

Capital Expenditures

The Company’s additions to fixed assets, including capitalized software, which amounted to $141 million in 2020 and $225 million in 2019, primarily related to the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, software development costs, and computer equipment purchases. 

Financing Activities

Cash flows used for financing activities in continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $2,088 million, an increase of $595 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for financing activities are share repurchases, issuances of debt, net of repayments, dividends paid to shareholders, issuances of shares for employee benefit plans, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities, such as collection of or payments for deferred consideration in connection with prior-year business acquisitions and divestitures.

Share Repurchase Program

We have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020 for a total of $20.0 billion in repurchase authorizations. Although the Company temporarily suspended its share Repurchase Program in the first half of the year, the Company resumed share buyback during the third quarter based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance.

On May 29, 2020, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Aon Corporation”), issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 5.00% Senior Notes, which were set to mature on September 30, 2020, for the redemption of all $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes. The redemption date was on June 30, 2020 and resulted in a loss of $7 million due to extinguishment.

On May 12, 2020, Aon Corporation issued $1 billion 2.80% Senior Notes due May 2030. Aon Corporation used a portion of the net proceeds on June 30, 2020 to repay its outstanding 5.00% Senior Notes, which were set to mature on September 30, 2020. The Company intends to use the remainder to repay other borrowings and for general corporate purposes.

On March 2020, the Company’s $400 million 2.80% Senior Notes due March 2021 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year.

On November 15, 2019, Aon Corporation issued $500 million 2.20% Senior Notes due November 2022. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down a portion of outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

On May 2, 2019, Aon Corporation issued $750 million 3.75% Senior Notes due May 2029. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down a portion of outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

Subsequent Events

On January 13, 2021, Aon Global Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon plc, issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 2.80% Senior Notes, which were set to mature in March 2021, for the redemption of all $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes. The redemption date was on February 16, 2021 and resulted in an insignificant loss due to extinguishment.

Other Liquidity Matters

Distributable Profits

The Company is required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). Following the Ireland Reorganization, we must reestablish distributable profits of the parent entity and will regularly create distributable profits as required to meet our capital needs. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (associated with Aon Global Limited), we had distributable profits in excess of $0.2 billion and $32.4 billion, respectively. We believe that we have the ability to create sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future.

Credit Facilities

We expect cash generated by operations for 2020 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, continue purchases of shares under the Repurchase Program, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.

43

As of December 31, 2020, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: our $900 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in February 2022 and our $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2023. Effective February 27, 2020, the $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility was increased by $350 million from the original $400 million. In aggregate, these two facilities provide $1.65 billion in available credit. 

Each of these facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2020, we did not have borrowings under either facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. 

Shelf Registration Statement

On May 12, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, Class A Ordinary Shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.

On March 11, 2020, Fitch Inc. (“Fitch”) placed our ‘BBB+’ rating on Rating Watch Negative (versus a prior Stable Outlook) following the announcement of the Combination. Negative Watch indicates that our Fitch rating could stay at its present level or potentially be downgraded. In its rating action commentary, Fitch states “rating expectations will unfold after further transaction details emerge and after Fitch evaluates both companies ongoing financial results prior to the projected first half 2021 closing”. We are committed to managing our current investment grade ratings. Any downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt or commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether, or impact future pension contribution requirements.

Guarantees in Connection with the Sale of the Divested Business

In connection with the sale of the Divested Business, we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the Buyer. We are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the Divested Business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements, which expire on various dates through 2025. As of December 31, 2020, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were $55 million, with an estimated fair value of $8 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the lease commitments during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Additionally, we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the Buyer. Should the Divested Business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements, we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms, which expire on various dates through 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were $104 million, with an estimated fair value of $1 million. No cash payments were made in connection to the performance guarantees during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Letters of Credit and Other Guarantees

We have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit (“LOC”). We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $79 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $73 million at December 31, 2019. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.

44

We have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $113 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $110 million at December 31, 2019.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Apart from commitments, guarantees, and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 16 “Claims, Lawsuits, and Other Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this report.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and purchase obligations.

Operating leases are primarily comprised of leased office space throughout the world. As leases expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. Refer to Note 9 “Lease Commitments” for further information.

Pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. Refer to Note 12 “Employee Benefits” for further information.

Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts. 

We had no other cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.

In accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.

47

Costs incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.

Commercial Risk Solutions 

includes retail brokerage, cyber solutions, global risk consulting, and captives. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units transferred and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. 

Reinsurance Solutions 

includes treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums for most treaty reinsurance arrangements.

Retirement Solutions 

includes core retirement, investment consulting, and human capital. Revenue consists primarily of fees paid by customers for consulting services. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services, or for certain arrangements, at a point in time upon completion of the services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.

Health Solutions

 includes health and benefits brokerage and health care exchanges. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants, net of a reserve for estimated cancellations. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.

Data & Analytic Services 

includes Affinity, Aon Inpoint, CoverWallet, and ReView. Revenue consists primarily of fees for services rendered and is generally recognized over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments. For arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the 

48

performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed.

Pensions

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted. 

The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense). We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.

Recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

Certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost. 

Unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.

As of December 31, 2020, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.

The following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2021 amortization of loss by country (in millions, except amortization period):

The U.S. had no unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2020. The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2020 was $43 million, and $(7) million for the U.K. and other plans, respectively.

For the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2020, the market-related value of assets was $2.1 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of plan assets was $2.3 billion. Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.

Rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation

The following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2020:

U.K.

U.S.

Other

Expected return on plan assets, net of administration expenses

2.04%

2.65 - 6.56%

1.70 - 2.65%

In determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.

The U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.

Impact of changing economic assumptions

Changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.

Holding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 basis point (“bps”) increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2020 (in millions):

Estimated future contributions

We estimate cash contributions of approximately $122 million to our pension plans in 2021 as compared with cash contributions of $120 million in 2020.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames, customer-related and contract-based, or technology and other.

Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. 

We perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component.

When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 

In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. 

We review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations

.

Contingencies

We define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection.

Share-Based Payments

Share-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Restricted Share Units

Restricted share units (“RSUs”) are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.

51

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards (“PSAs”) are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.

Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved, which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.

The largest plan is the Leadership Performance Plan (“LPP”), which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2018 to 2020 performance period ended on December 31, 2020, the 2017 to 2019 performance period ended on December 31, 2019, and the 2016 to 2018 performance period ended on December 31, 2018. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2019 to 2021 and 2020 to 2022. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2020 expense by approximately $7.2 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $7.2 million. 

Income Taxes

We earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries. 

The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.

We assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination. 

We base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.
