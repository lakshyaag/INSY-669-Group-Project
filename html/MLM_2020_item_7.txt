Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA




Earnings before interest; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates (Adjusted EBITDA) is an indicator used by the Company and investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by generally accepted accounting

or operating cash flow. 

However, the Company’s m

anagement 

believes that Adjusted 

EBITDA 

may provide additional information with respect to the Company’s performance. 

Since 

Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and may vary among companies, Adjusted EBITDA as presented by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

.

Mixed-Adjusted Average Selling Price




Mix-adjusted average selling price (mix-adjusted ASP) is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impacts of period-over-period product, geographic and other mix on the average selling price.  Mix-adjusted ASP is calculated by comparing current-period shipments to like-for-like shipments in the comparable prior period.  Management uses this metric to evaluate the realization of pricing increases and believes this information is useful to investors.  The following reconciles reported average selling price to mix-adjusted ASP and corresponding variances.

Inclusive of cost increases/decreases, product and geographic mix and other operating impacts




The increase in Building Materials business gross profit in 2020 compared with 2019 is primarily attributable to increased pricing, effective cost management, and lower energy and cement maintenance costs. The decline in gross profit in Magnesia Specialties is driven by lower sales due to the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. steel industry and inventory rationalization by international customers during the first portion of 2020, partially offset by cost reduction actions. 




Corporate gross profit includes intercompany royalty and rental revenue and expenses, depreciation and unallocated operational expenses excluded from the Company’s evaluation of business segment performance.

Aggregates pricing improved 3.1% compared with 2019, with the West Group reporting a modest increase of 1.7%, reflecting lower percentage of higher-priced commercial rail-shipped volumes in Texas that offset robust underlying pricing gains. On a mix-adjusted basis, the West Group pricing increase was 3.9%.  Aggregates volume declined in 2020, reflecting the broad economic impact from COVID-19, lower anticipated infrastructure shipments in North Carolina and reduced energy-sector shipments resulting from completed projects that were not immediately replaced.

Cement shipments increased 2.4% in 2020 versus prior year, reflective of strong demand in North and South Texas, partially offset by reduced energy-sector demand.  Cement pricing improved 1.0% compared with the prior year, with strength in North Texas, Houston and portions of Central Texas offset by lower sales of higher-priced oil-well specialty cement products into West Texas. On a mix-adjusted basis, cement pricing increased 3.2%. Cement product gross margin expanded 510 basis points driven by improved kiln reliability resulting from prior-period investments, lower fuel costs and the timing of planned kiln outages.




Ready mixed concrete pricing improved 2.0% and adjusted shipment volume increased 3.2% in 2020, after excluding shipments from ready mixed concrete operations acquired in the third quarter of 2020 and also excluding 2019 shipments from the Southwest Division’s ArkLaTex business that was divested in January 2020.  In 2020, asphalt pricing increased 2.7% and volumes improved 15.3%, attributable to strong customer demand and favorable weather compared with the prior year.




Magnesia Specialties. 

In 2020, Magnesia Specialties reported total revenues of $242.7 million, gross profit of $85.5 million and earnings from operations of $70.7 million, representing decreases of 11%, 10% and 15%, respectively, compared with 2019. The declines in 2020 compared with prior year are primarily attributable to lower lime and periclase shipments to the steel industry in response to COVID-19-induced shutdown of domestic auto manufacturers. Additionally, the business experienced a continued decline in chemicals products sales as both domestic and international customers experienced a downturn in economic activity related to COVID-19. Effective cost control contributed to product gross margin expansion of 80 basis points to 40.6%.




Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 




SG&A expenses for 2020 and 2019 were 6.5% and 6.4% of total revenues, respectively. The $3.2 million increase in total expense reflected higher personnel costs and $6.0 million in COVID-19 related expenses primarily for cleaning and sanitizing protocols across the Company’s operations, and were partially offset by reductions in other discretionary costs.  




Other Operating Income, Net 




Other operating income, net, is comprised generally of gains and losses on the sale of assets; recoveries and losses related to certain customer accounts receivable; rental, royalty and services income; accretion expense, depreciation expense and gains and losses related to asset retirement obligations. These net amounts represented income of $59.8 million in 2020 and $9.1 million in 2019. The 2020 amount included $69.9 million of nonrecurring gains on the sales of investment land and divested assets in Austin, Texas; Riverside, California; and Augusta, Kansas. These asset sales collectively generated net cash proceeds of $122.8 million. These gains were recorded in the West Group.  The 2019 amount included the reversal of $6.9 million of accruals for sales tax and unclaimed property contingencies. 




Earnings from Operations 




Consolidated earnings from operations were $1.0 billion and $884.9 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Interest Expense 




Interest expense was $118.1 million in 2020 and $129.3 million in 2019. The decrease reflects lower average outstanding debt during 2020 compared with 2019 and lower interest rates on variable-rate debt. 




Other Nonoperating (Income) and Expenses, Net 




Other nonoperating income and expenses, net, is comprised generally of interest income; foreign currency transaction gains and losses; pension and postretirement benefit cost (excluding service cost); net equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Consolidated other nonoperating income and expenses, net, was income of $2.0 million in 2020, and an expense of $7.3 million in 2019. The 2020 amount reflected lower pension expense of $8.1 million compared with the prior year and an expense of $11.4 million to finance third-party railroad track maintenance. 2019 expense included the correction of a prior-period error that overstated equity earnings from a nonconsolidated affiliate. The error was deemed immaterial to any previously-reported period and was corrected as an out-of-period expense of $15.7 million ($12.0 million, net of tax). The pretax noncash adjustment was recorded in other nonoperating expenses, net, consistent with the recurring classification of equity earnings from the affiliate. 




Income Tax Expense 




Variances in the estimated effective income tax rates, when compared with the statutory corporate income tax rate, are due primarily to the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves, the effect of state income taxes, stock compensation deductions, and the impact of foreign income or losses for which no tax expense or benefit is recognized. Additionally, certain acquisition-related expenses have limited deductibility for income tax purposes.




The permanent benefit associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves is typically the significant driver of the estimated effective income tax rate. The statutory depletion deduction is calculated as a percentage of revenues subject to certain limitations. Due to these limitations, changes in sales volumes and pretax earnings may not proportionately affect the statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate. However, the impact 

of the depletion deduction on the estimated effective tax rate is inversely affected by increases or decreases in pretax earnings.

 




The Company’s estimated effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 18.9% and 18.2%, respectively.




The effective income tax rate for 2020 included a $14.2 million discrete benefit from financing third-party railroad track maintenance.  In exchange, the Company received a federal income tax credit and deduction.  The 2019 income tax rate reflected a discrete income tax benefit of $15.2 million related to a change in tax status of a subsidiary. 




Net Earnings Attributable to Martin Marietta and Earnings Per Diluted Share 




Net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta were $721.0 million, or $11.54 per diluted share, for 2020 and $611.9 million, or $9.74 per diluted share, for 2019. 




Liquidity and Cash Flows 




Operating Activities 




Generally, the Company’s primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Operating cash flow is substantially derived from consolidated net earnings, before deducting depreciation, depletion and amortization, and offset by working capital requirements. Cash provided by operations was $1.05 billion in 2020 and $966.1 million in 2019. The primary driver of the increase in cash provided by operations in 2020 is higher earnings.

Investing Activities 




Net cash used for investing activities was $409.7 million in 2020 and $385.9 million in 2019. 




Cash paid for property, plant and equipment additions was $359.7 million in 2020 and $393.5 million in 2019, the reduction reflecting the Company’s decision to reduce capital expenditures in light of COVID-19. 




The Company paid cash of $65.1 million for acquisitions in 2020. There were no acquisitions in 2019.




Pretax proceeds from divestitures and sales of nonoperating land and equipment were $142.3 million in 2020 and $8.4 million in 2019. In 2020, the amount included the divestitures of investment land and assets in Austin, Texas; Riverside, California; and Augusta, Kansas. 




During 2020, the Company repaid $112.3 million of loans against company-owned life insurance policies.

Capital Structure and Resources 




Long-term debt, including current maturities, was $2.63 billion at December 31, 2020, and was principally in the form of publicly-issued long-term notes and debentures. 




On March 5, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2.500% Senior Notes). The 2.500% Senior Notes are carried net of original issue discount, which is being amortized by the effective interest method over the life of the issue. The 2.500% Senior Notes are redeemable prior to December 15, 2029 at their make-whole redemption price at a discount rate of the U.S. Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points, or on or after December 15, 2029 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $300.0 million of floating rate senior notes at maturity in May 2020.




The Company, through 

a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary,

 has a $400.0 million 

trade receivable securitization facility (the Trade Receivable Facility)

. In September 2020, the Company 

extended the maturity of the Trade Receivable Facility to September 22, 2021. 

The Trade Receivable Facility is backed by eligible trade receivables, as defined. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of the facility limit or the borrowing base, as defined

. These receivables are originated by the Company and then sold to the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary. 

The Company con

tinues to be responsible for the servicing and administration of the receivables purchased by 

the wholly-owned special-purpose 

subsidiary

. 

The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Company’s other debt agreements.




The $700.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving facility (the Revolving Facility), which matures in December 2024, requires the Company’s ratio of consolidated net debt-to-consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing-twelve month period (the Ratio) to not exceed 3.50x as of the end of any fiscal quarter, provided that the Company may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions during the quarter or the three preceding quarters so long as the Ratio calculated without such exclusion does not exceed 3.75x. Additionally, if there are no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility and the Trade Receivable Facility, consolidated debt, including debt for which the Company is a co-borrower, shall be reduced by the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million, such reduction not to exceed $200.0 million, for purposes of the covenant calculation. 




At December 31, 2020, the Company’s ratio of consolidated net debt-to-consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement governing the Revolving Facility (the Credit Agreement), for the trailing twelve-month EBITDA was 1.75 times and was calculated as follows:

share repurchases are at the discretion of management and were temporarily paused in March 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management may resume share repurchases as circumstances dictate.




At December 31, 2020, the Company had $207.3 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments that are considered cash equivalents. The Company manages its cash and cash equivalents to ensure short-term operating cash needs are met and excess funds are managed efficiently. The Company funds shortages in operating cash through credit facilities. The Company utilizes excess cash to either pay-down credit facility borrowings or invest in money market funds, money market demand deposit accounts or offshore time deposit accounts. Money market demand deposits and offshore time deposit accounts are exposed to bank solvency risk. Money market demand deposit accounts are FDIC insured up to $250,000. The Company’s investments in bank funds generally exceed the FDIC insurance limit. 




As of December 31, 2020, the Company had restricted cash of $97.1 million for the purchase of like-kind exchange replacement assets under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 1031). In January 2021, unused funds of $47.2 million were transferred to unrestricted cash and can subsequently be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has until March 9, 2021 to utilize additional funds for like-kind exchange replacement assets.  Any remaining unused funds will be transferred to unrestricted cash at that time. 




Cash on hand, along with the Company’s projected internal cash flows and availability of financing resources, including its access to debt and equity capital markets, is expected to continue to be sufficient to provide the capital resources necessary to support anticipated operating needs, cover debt service requirements, meet capital expenditures and discretionary investment needs, fund certain acquisition opportunities that may arise and allow for payment of dividends for the foreseeable future. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility are unsecured and may be used for general corporate purposes. The Company’s ability to borrow or issue securities is dependent upon, among other things, prevailing economic, financial and market conditions. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility. 




The Company may be required to obtain additional financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions or to refinance outstanding debt. Any strategic acquisition of size would likely require an appropriate balance of newly-issued equity with debt in order to maintain a composite investment-grade credit rating.  The Company is exposed to credit markets through the interest cost related to borrowings under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility. 




The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law in March 2020 and provides liquidity support for businesses.  The CARES Act allowed the Company to defer the payment of the 6.2% employer share of Social Security taxes for the period from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020.  Half of the deferred obligation will be due December 31, 2021 and the remaining half will be due December 31, 2022.  There will be no interest assessed on amounts deferred.  The Company deferred payment of $27.6 million under this provision.  




Contractual and Off Balance Sheet Obligations 




Postretirement medical benefits will be paid from the Company’s assets. The obligation, if any, for retiree medical payments is subject to the terms of the plan. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s recorded benefit obligation related to these benefits totaled $12.6 million. 




The Company has other retirement benefits related to pension plans. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the qualified pension plans’ assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation by $41.8 million. The Company estimates that it will make contributions of $75.1 million to qualified pension plans in 2021. Any contributions beyond 2021 are currently undeterminable and will depend on the investment return on the related pension assets. However, management’s practice is to fund at least the service cost annually. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a total obligation of $115.8 million related to unfunded nonqualified pension plans and expects to make contributions of $7.5 million to these plans in 2021. 




At December 31, 2020, the Company had $8.4 million accrued for uncertain tax positions, including interest and correlative effects of $0.2 million. Such liabilities may become payable if the tax positions are not sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.  




In connection with normal, ongoing operations, the Company enters into market-rate leases for property, plant and equipment and royalty commitments principally associated with leased land and mineral reserves. Additionally, the Company enters into equipment rentals to meet shorter-term, nonrecurring and intermittent needs. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $459.0 million in operating lease obligations and $24.5 million in finance lease obligations, representing the present value of future payments. The imputed interest on operating and finance lease obligations was $174.3 million. Management anticipates that, in the ordinary course of business, the Company will enter into additional royalty agreements

. 




As of December 31, 2020, interest payable on the Company’s publicly traded debt through the various maturity dates was $1.35 billion.  The Company has obligations related to contracts of affreightment not accounted for as a lease and royalty agreements totaling $120.2 million and $119.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The Company has purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment of $102.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company also has other purchase obligations related to energy and service contracts which totaled $122.4 million as of December 31, 2020.




Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 




The Company has entered into standby letter of credit agreements relating to certain insurance claims, contract performance and permit requirements. At December 31, 2020, the Company had contingent liabilities guaranteeing its own performance under these outstanding letters of credit of $32.0 million. 




In the normal course of business, at December 31, 2020, the Company was contingently liable for $390.2 million in surety bonds, which guarantee its own performance and are required by certain states and municipalities and their related agencies. The Company has indemnified the underwriting insurance companies against any exposure under the surety bonds. In the Company’s past experience, no material claims have been made against these financial instruments. 




The Company is a co-borrower with an unconsolidated affiliate for a $12.5 million revolving line of credit agreement with Truist Bank. The affiliate has agreed to reimburse and indemnify the Company for any payments and expenses the Company may incur from this agreement. The Company holds a lien on the affiliate’s membership interest in a joint venture as collateral for payment under the revolving line of credit. 




Other Financial Information

 




Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 




The Company’s audited consolidated financial statements include certain critical estimates regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates require management’s subjective and complex judgments. Amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements could differ materially if management used different assumptions in making these estimates, resulting in actual results differing from those estimates. Methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates, as well as the related disclosures, have been reviewed by and discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee. Management’s determination of the critical nature of accounting estimates and judgments may change from time to time depending on facts and circumstances that management cannot currently predict. 




Impairment Review of Goodwill 




Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment. An interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill represented 23% of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2020; the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions; and an impairment charge could be material to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company performs its impairment evaluation as of October 1, which represents the annual evaluation date.




The Company’s reporting units, which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are based on the operating segments of the Building Materials business. The Southwest Division is the most significant reporting unit and includes $1.7 billion of the Company’s goodwill. There is no goodwill related to the Magnesia Specialties business. 




Certain of the aforementioned reporting units within the Building Materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting.  




Goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting unit(s) based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation. If subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit, a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value, which represents a Step-1 analysis. However, prior to Step 1, the Company may perform an optional qualitative assessment, or Step 0. As part of the qualitative assessment, the Company considers, among other things, the following events and circumstances: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other business or reporting unit-specific events. If the Company concludes it is

  Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that a reporting unit’s fair value is higher than its carrying value, the Company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit. Otherwise, it proceeds to Step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis. The Company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in Step 1. When the Company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value, it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further calculation is necessary. A reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a Step

-

1 failure and 

results in an 

impairment charge.




For the 2020 annual impairment evaluation, the Company performed a Step-0 analysis for all reporting units and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting units’ fair values exceed their carrying values. 




Any potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the Company.




Pension Benefit Obligation and Pension Expense – Selection of Assumptions 




The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain retirees (see Note K to the consolidated financial statements). Annually, as of December 31, management remeasures the defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation based on the present value of the projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date, reflecting 

expected future pay increases through the participants’ expected retirement dates. A discount rate assumption is selected annually based on corporate bond rates as of the measurement date to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation.




Annual pension expense, referred to as net periodic benefit cost within the consolidated financial statements, (inclusive of SERP expense) consists of several components:
















 







•







Service Cost, 

which represents the present value of benefits attributed to services rendered in the current year, measured by expected future salary levels to assumed retirement dates;
















 







•







Interest Cost, 

which represents one year’s additional interest on the projected benefit obligation;
















 







•







Expected Return on Assets, 

which represents the expected investment return on pension plan assets; and
















 







•







Amortization of Prior Service Cost and Actuarial Gains and Losses, 

which

 

represents components that are recognized over time rather than immediately. Prior service cost represents credit given to employees for years of service already accrued, of which there is an insignificant amount at December 31, 2020. Actuarial gains and losses arise from changes in assumptions regarding future events, a change in the benefit obligation resulting from experience different from assumed or when actual returns on pension assets differ from expected returns. At December 31, 2020, the unrecognized actuarial loss was $245.9 million. Pension accounting rules currently allow companies to amortize the portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss that represents more than 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or pension plan assets, using the average remaining service life for the amortization period. Therefore, the $245.9 million unrecognized actuarial loss consists of $134.7 million currently subject to amortization in 2021 and $111.2 million not subject to amortization in 2021. 




These components are calculated annually to determine the annual pension expense. 




Management believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense and related projected benefit obligation is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense and obligation dependent on selected assumptions. The key assumptions are as follows:
















 







•







The 

discount rate

 is used to present value the projected benefit obligation and represents the current rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
















 







•







The 

expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets

 is used to estimate future asset returns and should reflect the average rate of long-term earnings on assets invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation.
















 







•







The 

mortality table 

and 

mortality improvement scale 

represent published statistics on the expected lives of people

.
















 







•







The 

rate of increase in future compensation levels

 is used to project the pay-related pension benefit formula and should estimate actual future compensation levels.




Management’s selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the obligations. The Company selected a hypothetical portfolio of Moody’s Aa bonds, 

with maturities that match the benefit

obligations,

 to determine the discount rate. At 

December 31, 20

, the Company selected a discount rate assumption of 

3.

1

6

%, a 

53

-basis-point 

de

crease

 

compared with

 the prior-year assumption. Of the four key assumptions, the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate. Accordingly, a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the annual pension expense

 and 

the 

projected benefit obligation

. 




Management’s selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels, which reflects cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases, is generally based on the Company’s historical increases in pensionable earnings, while giving consideration to any future expectations. A higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense and a higher projected benefit obligation. The assumed long-term rate of increase is 4.5%.




Management’s selection of the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets is based on a building-block approach, whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets. Based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses, the Company selected an expected return on assets of 6.75%, the same as the prior-year rate. The following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets:





































(in millions)







 







Expected Return on Pension Assets







 







Actual Return on Pension Assets













2020







 







$58.4







 







$127.7













2019







 







$47.9







 







$131.3










 




The difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is included in actuarial gains and losses, which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described.




At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the Society of Actuaries’ Pri-2012 Base Mortality Table. The no-collar table was used for salaried participants and the blue-collar table

 was used for hourly participants, both adjusted to reflect the historical experience of the Company’s participants. The Company selected the MP-2020 and the MP-2018 scales for mortality improvement at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively

.




Assumptions are selected on December 31 to calculate the succeeding year’s expense. For the 2020 pension expense, assumptions selected at December 31, 2019 were as follows:
















  Discount rate







 







3.69%







 













  Rate of increase in future compensation levels







 







4.50%







 













  Expected long-term rate of return on assets







 







6.75%

10 years







 













  Mortality Tables:

Using these assumptions, the pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 was $977.8 million and 2020 pension expense was $36.8 million. A change in the assumptions would have had the following impact on the December 31, 2019 pension benefit obligation and the 2020 expense: 
















 







•







A 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would have changed the December 31, 2019 pension benefit obligation by approximately $36.3 million. 
















 







•







A 25-basis-point 

change in the discount rate would have changed the 2020 expense by 

approximately $4.7 million.
















 







•







A 25-basis-point change in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have changed the 2020 expense by approximately $2.2 million.

The assumptions selected at December 31, 2020 were as follows:
















  Discount rate

Using these assumptions, pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 was $1.11 billion and 2021 pension expense is expected to be approximately $25.9 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans. Changes in the underlying assumptions would have the following estimated impact on the obligation and expected expense: 
















 







•







A 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would have changed the December 31, 2020 pension benefit obligation by approximately $40.9 million.
















 







•







A 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would change the 2021 expected expense by approximately $5.4 million.
















 







•







A 25-basis-point change in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would change the 2021 expected expense by approximately $2.6 million.  




The Company made pension plan contributions of $88.4 million in 2020 and $385.3 million during the five-year period ended December 31, 2020. Despite these contributions, the Company’s pension plans are underfunded (projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets) by $74.0 million at December 31, 2020. The Company’s projected benefit obligation was $1.11 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $134.1 million versus the prior year, driven by the lower discount rate. The Company expects to make pension plan and SERP contributions of $82.6 million in 2021, of which $75.0 million are voluntary.




Estimated Effective Income Tax Rate 




The Company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes. Accordingly, the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes, estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management’s judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The result is management’s estimate of the annual effective tax rate (the ETR).  




Income for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the United States Internal Revenue Code and the statutes of various foreign, state and local tax jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. Changes in the statutory tax rates and/or tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material effect on the ETR. The effect of these changes, if material, is recognized when the change is enacted. 




As prescribed by these tax regulations, as well as generally accepted accounting principles, the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same. Therefore, these differences between the Company’s pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent, depending on their nature.




Temporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period. An example of a temporary difference is the use of the straight-line method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes. Temporary differences result from differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities (i.e., future tax deductions or future taxable income). Therefore, when temporary differences occur, they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account. As such, total income tax expense as reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences. 




The Company has deferred tax liabilities, primarily for right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to property, plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straight-line and units-of-production methods used for financial reporting purposes. These temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes. This temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes, either through divestitures or an impairment

charge. The timing of such events cannot be estimated. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards. The reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the Company’s contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes. The temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over

 the

 life of 

the 

investment or through divestiture.




The Company has deferred tax assets, primarily for inventories, unvested stock-based compensation awards, unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans, lease liabilities, valuation reserves, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes. The reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances, including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stock-based compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes. For financial reporting purposes, the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period. For income tax purposes, no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture. The Company reflects all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles, increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period. 




Business Combinations – Allocation of Purchase Price 




The Company’s Board of Directors and management regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase the Company’s market presence and/or are related to the Company’s existing markets. When an acquisition is completed, the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date control is obtained. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions. Further, the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination.  




Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and, therefore, represents an exit price.  Fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible at the measurement date.  The Company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options:
















 







•







Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
















 







•







Level 2 – Observable inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
















 







•







Level 3 – Unobservable inputs, used to value the asset or liability which includes the use of valuation models




Level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly traded long-term debt.




Level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired receivables, inventories, machinery and equipment, land, buildings, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accruals for payables, asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations, and contingencies. Additionally, Level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at other-than-market rates.  




Level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and mineral interests produced and sold as final products, and separately-identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of mineral reserves and mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the

  Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




specific operation and contributory asset charges. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include changes in sales price, shipment volumes and production costs as well as capital needs. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business, with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows.




The Company values separately-identifiable acquired intangible assets which may include, but are not limited to, permits, customer relationships, water rights and noncompetition agreements. The fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method, a replacement cost method or, in the case of water rights, a market approach. 




The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings. The selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the Company subsequent to the business combination.




The Company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are based on the Company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement-period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The measurement period ends once the Company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings.




Property, Plant and Equipment 




Net property, plant and equipment represented 50% of total assets at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy. Useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors, including production levels, geographic location, portability and maintenance practices. Additionally, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. Historically, the Company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets.




Aggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant, property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates aggregates reserves, including those used in the cement manufacturing process, in several ways, depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite, an acquisition or an existing operation. Greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time, site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting (see 

Environmental Regulation and Litigation

 section). The depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site. Further, the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable. If the Company’s analysis based on these factors is satisfactory, the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location. Reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing 

adjoining properties, for quality control, calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning. Reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves.

 




Well-ordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location. This subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling, determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling. The Company’s objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable. Locations underlain with hard rock deposits, such as granite and limestone, are drilled using the diamond core method, which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit. Selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use. The number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the site-specific geology. Some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults, folds, chemical irregularities, clay pockets, thickness of formations and weathering. A typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres, but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous. 




Despite previous drilling and sampling, once accessed, the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary. Construction contracts, for the infrastructure market in particular, include specifications related to the aggregates material. If a flaw in the deposit is discovered, the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications. Although it is possible that the

aggregates material can still be used for non-specification uses, this can have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to serve certain customers or on the Company’s profitability. In addition, other issues can arise that limit the Company’s ability to access reserves in a particular quarry, including geological occurrences, blasting practices and zoning issues.




Locations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method, whereby a six-inch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled. Deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness. Additionally, the quality and sand-to-gravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically. Hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling. 




The geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the Company. Further, the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit, based on U.S. geological maps, also dictates the number of holes drilled.




The generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the Company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows:




Proven Reserves

 – These reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in U.S. geologic maps, the U.S. Department of Agriculture soil maps, aerial photographs and/or electromagnetic, seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms. The proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps, safety benches, pillars (underground) and the fines (small particles) that will be generated during processing. Proven reserves are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas, as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines. The Company typically assumes a loss factor of 25%. However, the assumed loss factor at coastal operations is approximately 40% due to the nature of the material. The assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35% primarily due to pillars. 




Probable Reserves

 – These reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes and/or assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties.




The Company’s proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and also include reserves at the Company’s inactive and undeveloped sites, including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth. The Company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting (see 

Environmental Regulation and Litigation

 section).




Mineral reserves and mineral interests, when acquired in connection with a business combination, are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves.




The Company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its units-of-production calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests. For 2020, depletion expense was $35.9 million.




The Company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. Capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. Capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements.




New mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves. When this occurs, management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related pre-production development costs. If the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry, the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. Further, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred. Once a new mining area enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs.

Further, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability. If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations. 




The Company’s principal business serves customers in construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Building Materials business and, therefore, profitability. Production costs in the Building Materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel, coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas.




Transportation in the Company’s long-haul network, particularly the supply of railcars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Company’s efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets, most notably Texas, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and the Gulf Coast. In addition, availability of railcars and locomotives affects the Company’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and its customers. The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Company’s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs. 




All of the Company’s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters. 




Risks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Company’s control. 




In addition to the foregoing, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report include but are not limited to those listed above in Item 1, “Business – Competition,

” Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and 

“Note A: Accounting Policies” and “Note O: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. 




You should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and other filings made with the SEC.  All of the Company’s forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors.  In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company considers immaterial could affect the accuracy of its forward-looking statements, or adversely affect or be material to the Company.  All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of filing or publication and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.

  Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk




 




ITEM 7A – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 




As discussed earlier, the Company’s operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Consequently, these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs (see 

Business Environment

 section included under Item 7 – MD&A of this Form 10-K).  




Management has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the Company’s business. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues. Further, delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty.




Demand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates. During 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate, and at December 31, 2020, the rate was 0.09%. The residential construction market accounted for approximately 24% of the Company’s aggregates shipments in 2020. 




Aside from these inherent risks from within its operations, the Company’s earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates. 




Variable-Rate Borrowing Facilities




At December 31, 2020, the Company had a $700 million Revolving Facility and a $400 million Trade Receivable Facility.  Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any outstanding variable-rate debt.  However, any future borrowings under the credit facilities or outstanding variable-rate debt are exposed to interest rate risk.  




Pension Expense




The Company’s results of operations are affected by its pension expense. Assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and, for the defined benefit pension plans only, the expected long-term rate of return on assets. Therefore, the Company has interest rate risk associated with these factors. The impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the Company’s annual pension expense is discussed in the 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension Expense – Selection of Assumptions

 section included under Item 7 – MD&A of this Form 10-K.




Energy Costs 




Energy costs, including diesel fuel, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke and liquid asphalt, represent significant production costs of the Company. The Company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of energy to customers in the form of price increases for the Company’s products. The cement product line and Magnesia Specialties business each have varying fixed-price agreements for a portion of their energy requirements. A hypothetical 10% change in the Company’s energy prices in 2021 as compared with 2020, assuming constant volumes, would change 2021 energy expense by $23.1 million. 




Commodity Risk




Cement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the Company’s control. Increases in the production capacity of industry participants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which can have a negative impact on product prices. There can be no assurance that product prices will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. A hypothetical 10% change in sales price of the cement product line would impact cement product line revenues by $45.3 million. 




Cement is a key raw material in the production of ready mixed concrete. The Company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of cement and raw materials to customers in the form of price increases for the Company’s products. A hypothetical 10% change in cement costs in 2021 compared with 2020, assuming constant volumes, would change the ready mixed concrete product line cost of sales by $25.5 million. While increases in cement pricing may negatively impact the profitability of the ready mixed concrete operations, the cement business would benefit, although the positive impact may not reflect a direct correlation to the impact to the ready mix business.

Statement of Responsibility and Management’s

 Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 




Management’s Statement of Responsibility




The management of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the Company or Martin Marietta) is responsible for the consolidated financial statements, the related financial information contained in this Form 10-K and the establishment and maintenance of adequate internal control over financial reporting. The consolidated balance sheets for Martin Marietta, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, include amounts based on estimates and judgments and 

have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applied on a consistent basis.

 




A system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, in a cost-effective manner, that assets are safeguarded, transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with management’s authorization, accountability for assets is maintained and financial statements are prepared and presented fairly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control systems over financial reporting have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  




The Company operates in an environment that establishes an appropriate system of internal control over financial reporting and ensures that the system is maintained, assessed and monitored on a periodic basis. This internal control system includes examinations by internal audit staff and oversight by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 




The Company’s management recognizes its responsibility to foster a strong ethical climate. Management has issued written policy statements that document the Company’s business code of ethics. The importance of ethical behavior is regularly communicated to all employees through the distribution of the 

Code of Ethical Business Conduct

 and through ongoing education and review programs designed to create a strong commitment to ethical business practices. 




The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists of four independent, nonemployee directors, meets periodically and separately with management, the independent auditors and the internal auditors to review the activities of each. The Audit Committee meets standards established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Stock Exchange as they relate to the composition and practices of audit committees.




Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 




The management of Martin Marietta is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in 

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on management’s assessment under the 2013 framework, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. 




The consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, have 

been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, whose report appears on the following page.

Report of Independent Registe

red Public Accounting Firm 




To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. 




Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting




We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 appearing under Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework 

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 




In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

 (2013) issued by the COSO. 




Change in Accounting Principle




As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.




Basis for Opinions




The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 




We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 




Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 




Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting




A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 




 
















A World-Class Organization Built for Success













Form 10-K

Page 67










 







Part II  

♦

  Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data




that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

. 




Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




Critical Audit Matters 




The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 




Valuation of the Projected Benefit Obligation




As described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s net projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,111.9 million as of December 31, 2020. As disclosed by management, annually, as of December 31, management remeasures the defined benefit plans’ projected benefit obligation based on the present value of projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date, reflecting expected future pay increases through the participants’ expected retirement dates. The key assumptions are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the mortality table and mortality improvement scale, and the rate of increase in future compensation levels.  The discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate. Accordingly, a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the projected benefit obligation.    




 




The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the projected benefit obligation is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management to determine the projected benefit obligation; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the discount rate assumption; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.




 




Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the projected benefit obligation, including controls over the discount rate assumption. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuation of the projected benefit obligation and the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) testing management’s process for determining the projected benefit obligation, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial method, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption.

Notes to Financial Statements 




Note A: Accounting Policies 




Organization. 

Martin Marietta is a natural resource-based building materials company. The Company supplies aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 

300

 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 

27

 states, Canada and The Bahamas.  In the western United States, Martin Marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in markets where the Company also has a leading aggregates position. Specifically, the Company has 

two

 cement plants and several cement distribution facilities in Texas and Louisiana, and 

120

 ready mixed concrete plants and 

eight

 asphalt plants in Texas, Colorado and Wyoming. Asphalt operations and paving services are exclusively in Colorado. The Company’s heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects. Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast. The aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the Building Materials business. 

 




Effective July 1, 2020, the Company made organizational changes, consolidating its operational management and operating divisions in connection with the retirement of 

two

 senior executives as of the end of the second quarter. The Mid-Atlantic Division and Southeast Division were combined to form the East Division. Additionally, the Southwest Aggregates Division and the Cement and Southwest Ready Mix Division were combined to form the Southwest Division. Subsequent to these changes, the Building Materials business consists of 

four

 divisions: East, Central, Southwest and West. Each division, as well as the Magnesia Specialties business, represents an operating segment. 




As of December 31, 2020, the Building Materials business contains the following reportable segments: East Group and West Group. The East Group, whose operations were previously reported in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups, consists of the East and Central Divisions and operates in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, eastern Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Nova Scotia and The Bahamas. The West Group is comprised of the Southwest and West Divisions and operates in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, western Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. In addition to these states, the Company sells to customers in New York, Delaware, New Mexico and Mississippi. The following states accounted for 

71

% of the Building Materials business’ 2020 total revenues: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company moved the management of its one quarry in the state of Washington from the East Group to the West Group, resulting in an immaterial change to its reportable segments. Prior-year segment disclosures have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.




The Company also operates a Magnesia Specialties business, which produces magnesia-based chemical products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications, and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and land stabilization. Magnesia Specialties’ production facilities are located in Ohio and Michigan, and products are shipped to customers worldwide. During 2020, there were no changes to the Magnesia Specialties reportable segment.




Basis of Presentation and

 

Use of Estimates. 

The Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets as well as assumptions used in the calculation of income tax expense, retirement and postemployment benefits, stock-based compensation, the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations and revenue recognition for service contracts.  These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s judgment. Management evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Changes in credit, equity and energy markets and changes in construction activity increase the uncertainty inherent in certain estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects, including the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the related responses, cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. Changes in estimates, including those resulting from changes in the economic environment, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the period in which the change in estimate occurs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company identified a prior-period error that overstated its earnings from a nonconsolidated equity affiliate. The pretax noncash adjustment was deemed immaterial to prior periods and was therefore corrected as an out-of-period expense of $

15.7

 million

  Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data




that was

 recorded in other nonoperating expenses, consistent with the recurring classification of equity earnings from the nonconsolidated affiliate.




Basis of Consolidation

.

 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Partially-owned affiliates are either consolidated or accounted for using the cost method or the equity method, depending on the level of ownership interest or the Company’s ability to exercise control over the affiliates’ operations. Intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.

 




Revenue Recognition

.

 

Total revenues include sales of products and services provided to customers, net of discounts or allowances, if any, and include freight and delivery costs billed to customers. Revenues for product sales are recognized when control of the promised good is transferred to unaffiliated customers, typically when finished products are shipped. Revenues derived from the paving business are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method under the cost-to-cost approach. Under the cost-to-cost approach, recognized contract revenue is determined by multiplying the total estimated contract revenue by the estimated percentage of completion. Contract costs are recognized as incurred. The percentage of completion is determined on a contract-by-contract basis using project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs. The Company believes the cost-to-cost approach is appropriate, as the use of asphalt in a paving contract is relatively consistent with the performance of the related paving services. Paving contracts, notably with governmental entities, may contain performance bonuses based on quality specifications. Given the uncertainty of meeting the criteria until the performance obligation is completed, performance bonuses are recognized as revenues when and if achieved. Performance bonuses were not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Freight revenues reflect delivery arranged by the Company using a third party on behalf of the customer and are recognized consistently with the timing of the product revenues.




Freight and Delivery Costs

. 

Freight and delivery costs represent pass-through transportation costs incurred and paid by the Company to third-party carriers to deliver products to customers. These costs are then billed to the customers. 




Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

.

 

Cash equivalents are comprised of highly-liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.  




As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $

97.1

 million of restricted cash, which was invested in an account designated for the purchase of like-kind exchange replacement assets under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 1031). The Company is restricted from utilizing the cash for purposes other than the purchase of the qualified assets for 

180

 days from receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the exchanged property. Any unused cash at the end of the 

180

 days will be transferred to unrestricted accounts of the Company and can then be used for general corporate purposes. The Company did not use $

47.2

 million within the allowable 

180

-day period and transferred that amount to unrestricted cash in January 2021. The Company has until March 9, 2021 to utilize the remaining funds to purchase qualified assets under Section 1031.




In connection with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-18, 

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)

, the statement of cash flows reflects cash flow changes and balances for cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on an aggregated basis.




The following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported on the consolidated balance sheets to the aggregated amounts presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows:

Accounts Receivable. 

Accounts receivable are stated at cost. The Company does not typically charge interest on customer accounts receivable. The Company records an allowance for credit losses, which includes a provision for probable losses based on historical write-offs, adjusted for current conditions as deemed necessary, and a specific reserve for accounts deemed at risk. The allowance is the Company’s estimate for receivables as of the balance sheet date that ultimately will not be collected. Any changes in the allowance are reflected in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when it becomes probable, based upon customer facts and circumstances, that such amounts will not be collected. 




Inventories Valuation

. 

 Finished products and in process inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs, which approximate the first-in, first-out method. Carrying value for parts and supplies are determined by the weighted-average cost method. The Company records an allowance for finished product inventories based on an analysis of future demand and inventory on hand in excess of historical sales for a 

twelve-month

 period or an annual average for a period of up to 

five year

s. The Company also establishes an allowance for parts over 

five years

 old and supplies over a year old.

Post-production stripping costs, which represent costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits, are a component of inventory production costs and recognized as incurred. 




Property, Plant and Equipment

.

 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. 




The estimated service lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows: 




 
















Class of Assets







 







Range of Service Lives













Buildings







 







5

 to 

30

 years













Machinery & Equipment







 







2

 to 

20

 years













Land Improvements







 







5

 to 

60

 years










 




The Company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. Capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. Capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements and depreciated over the life of the reserves. 




The Company reviews relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether to capitalize or expense pre-production stripping costs when additional pits are developed at an existing quarry. If the additional pit operates in a separate and distinct area of the quarry, these costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. Additionally, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional pits when the liability is incurred. Once a pit enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are charged to inventory production costs as incurred. 




Mineral reserves and mineral interests acquired in connection with a business combination are valued using an income approach for the estimated life of the reserves. The Company’s aggregates reserves average approximately 90 years, based on 2020 production levels.




Depreciation is computed based on estimated service lives using the straight-line method. Depletion of mineral reserves is calculated based on proven and probable reserves using the units-of-production method on a quarry-by-quarry basis. 




Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if expected future undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining service life of the related asset group are less than the asset group’s carrying value. 




Repair and Maintenance Costs.

 

Repair and maintenance costs that do not substantially extend the life of the Company’s plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. 




Leases.

 

If the Company determines a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the agreement, the Company records right-of-use (ROU) assets, which represent the Company’s right to use an underlying leased asset, and leased liabilities, which represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments. The ROU asset and lease liability are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The Company determines the present value of lease payments based on the implicit interest rate, which may be explicitly stated in the lease, if available, or may be the Company’s estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the term of the lease.  Initial ROU assets also include any lease payments made at or before commencement date and any initial direct costs incurred and are reduced by lease incentives. Certain of the Company’s leases contain renewal and/or termination options. The Company recognizes renewal or termination options as part of its ROU assets and lease liabilities when the Company has the unilateral right to renew or terminate and it is reasonably certain these options will be exercised.  




Some leases require the Company to pay non-lease components, which may include taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses applicable to the leased property, and are primarily variable costs.  The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single amount, with the exception of railcar and fleet vehicle leases, for which the Company separately accounts for the lease and non-lease components.




Leases are evaluated and determined to be either operating leases or finance leases.  The lease is a finance lease if it: transfers ownership to the underlying asset by the end of the lease term; includes a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised; has a lease term for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset; has a present value of the sum of the lease payments that equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset; or is for an underlying asset that is of a specialized nature and is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.  If none of these terms exist, the lease is an operating lease.

L

eases with an initial

 lease term of one year or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Costs for these leases are expensed as incurred

.




In the consolidated statements of earnings, operating lease expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the amortization of finance lease ROU assets are included in cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses.  Accretion on the liabilities for finance leases is included in interest expense. 




Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

 

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. Other intangible assets represent amounts assigned principally to contractual agreements and are either amortized ratably over the useful lives to the Company or not amortized if deemed to have an indefinite useful life.




The Company’s reporting units, which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are based on the operating segments of the Building Materials business. Goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting unit(s) based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value, which represents a Step-1 approach. However, prior to Step 1, the Company may perform a qualitative assessment and evaluate macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other business or reporting unit-specific events that contribute to the fair value of a reporting unit.  If the Company concludes it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that a reporting unit’s fair value is higher than its carrying value, the Company is not required to perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit. Otherwise, the Company proceeds to Step 1, and if a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment. A reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value results in an impairment charge equal to the difference.




The carrying values of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, as of October 1. An interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment. The carrying value of other amortizable intangible assets is reviewed if facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment. If a review indicates the carrying value is impaired, a charge is recorded. 




Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits. 

The Company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans and also provides other postretirement benefits. The Company recognizes the funded status, defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, of its pension plans and other postretirement benefits as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial gains or losses that arise during the year are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings or loss. Those amounts are amortized over the participants’ average remaining service period and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost.  The amount amortized is determined using a corridor approach and represents the excess over 

10

% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or pension plan assets. 




Insurance Reserves. 

The Company has insurance coverage with large deductibles for workers’ compensation, automobile liability, marine liability and general liability claims, and is also self-insured for health claims. The Company records insurance reserves based on an actuarial-determined analysis, which calculates development factors that are applied to total case reserves within the insurance programs. While the Company believes the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate, 

significant differences in actual experience and/or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect insurance costs

.




Stock-Based Compensation. 

The Company has stock-based compensation plans for employees and its Board of Directors. The Company recognizes all forms of stock-based awards that vest as compensation expense. The compensation expense is the fair value of the awards at the measurement date and is recognized over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.




The fair value of restricted stock awards, incentive compensation stock awards and Board of Directors’ fees paid in the form of common stock are based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant dates.  The fair value of performance stock awards as of the grant dates is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology.




Environmental Matters. 

The Company records a liability for an asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at the acquisition date of a long-lived tangible asset if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. A corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying amount. The fair value is affected by management’s assumptions regarding the scope of the work, inflation rates and asset retirement dates. 




Further, the Company records an accrual for other environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the appropriate amounts can be estimated reasonably. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Generally, these costs are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site.

Income Taxes

.

 

Deferred income taxes, net, on the consolidated balance sheets reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, net of valuation allowances. The effect of changes in enacted tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment.




Uncertain Tax Positions. 

The Company recognizes a tax benefit when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that a tax position would be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. The amount to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 

50

% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or as an offset to the deferred tax asset for tax carryforwards where available.

 




The Company records interest accrued in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recorded as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. 




Sales Taxes. 

Sales taxes collected from customers are recorded as liabilities until remitted to taxing authorities and therefore are not reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings. 




Start-Up Costs.

 

Noncapital start-up costs for new facilities and products are charged to operations as incurred. 




Consolidated Comprehensive Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

. 

Consolidated comprehensive earnings for the Company consist of consolidated net earnings, adjustments for the funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans, foreign currency translation adjustments and the amortization of the value of terminated forward starting interest rate 

swap agreements into interest expense, and are presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings

. 




Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of unrecognized gains and losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, and is presented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Earnings Per Common Share

. 

The Company computes earnings per common share (EPS) pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines EPS for common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company paid nonforfeitable dividend equivalents during the vesting period on its restricted stock awards and incentive stock awards made prior to 2016, which results in these being considered participating securities. 




The numerator for basic and diluted earnings per common share is net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta, reduced by dividends and undistributed earnings attributable to the Company’s participating securities. The denominator for basic earnings per common share is the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed assuming that the weighted-average number of common shares is increased by the conversion, using the treasury stock method, of awards issued to employees and nonemployee members of the Company’s Board of Directors under certain stock-based compensation arrangements if the conversion is dilutive. 




The following table reconciles the numerator and denominator for basic and diluted earnings per common share:

New Accounting Pronouncements




Credit Losses




Effective 

January 1, 2020

, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, 

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses

 (ASU 2016-13), which includes a current expected credit loss (CECL) model that requires an entity to estimate credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures based on historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts at the time the asset is recognized and is remeasured at each reporting period. ASU 2016-13 primarily relates to the Company’s receivables, but the scope also includes retainage and contract assets related to its paving business. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or statement of earnings and comprehensive earnings, but the Company amended its allowance for credit losses policy for the implementation of ASU 2016-13.




Defined Benefit Plan Disclosures




Effective for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2018-14, 

Compensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General 

(ASU 2018-14), which simplifies disclosures requirements for defined benefit plans. ASU 2018-14 requires explanations for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation; eliminates sensitivity disclosures for a one-percent change in the assumed health care cost trend rate; and eliminates the disclosure of the estimated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit costs over the next year. Disclosures in Note K have been modified on a retrospective basis for all years presented.




Leases




Effective 

January 1, 2019

, the Company adopted ASC 842, which applies to virtually all leases, excluding mineral interest royalty agreements.  ASC 842 requires the modified retrospective transition approach, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. It further states that an entity may use either 1) its effective date or 2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. The Company used the effective date as the date of initial application. As such, financial information and disclosures required under ASC 842 are not provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019.




The lease standard provides a number of practical expedients for transition accounting. The Company elected the “package of practical expedients”, which permitted the Company to not reassess its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company elected the practical expedients pertaining to the use of hindsight and to land easements. Applying the hindsight practical expedient resulted in longer lease terms for many leases. 




The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities of $

502.5

 million and $

501.6

 million, respectively, for operating leases and $

10.9

 million and $

12.1

 million, respectively, for finance leases. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings or consolidated statement of cash flows

.




Note B: Revenue Recognition




Performance Obligations.

 

Performance obligations are contractual promises to transfer or provide a distinct good or service for a stated price. The Company’s product sales agreements are single-performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time.  

Performance obligations within paving service agreements are satisfied over time, primarily ranging from 

one day

 to 

two years

. For product revenues and freight revenues, customer payment terms are generally 

30

 days from invoice date. Customer payments for the paving operations are based on a contractual billing schedule and are due 

30

 days from invoice date.




Future revenues from unsatisfied performance obligations at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $

110.1

 million, $

136.1

 million

 and $

78.1

 million, 

respectively, where the remaining periods

 to complete these obligations ranged from 

one month

 to 

22

 months

.

 




Sales Taxes.

 

The Company is deemed to be an agent when collecting sales taxes from customers.  Sales taxes collected are recorded as liabilities until remitted to taxing authorities and are not reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as revenues and expenses.

Contract Balances.

 

Costs in excess of billings relate to the conditional right to consideration for completed contractual performance and are contract assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs in excess of billings are reclassified to accounts receivable when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Billings in excess of costs relate to customers invoiced in advance of contractual performance and are contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Retainage, which primarily relates to the paving services, represents amounts that have been billed to customers but payment withheld until final acceptance of the performance obligation by the customer. Included

 in 

Other current assets 

on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, retainage was $

10.6

 million and $

10.2

 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.




Policy Elections.

 

When the Company arranges third-party freight to deliver products to customers, the Company has elected the delivery to be a fulfillment activity rather than a separate performance obligation.  Further, the Company acts as a principal in the delivery arrangements and, as required by the revenue standard, the related revenues and costs are presented gross and are included in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Note D: Business Combinations 




In August 2020, the Company acquired certain assets, including a sand and gravel plant and 

four

 ready mixed concrete operations. This acquisition provides customer expansion in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas market and the ability to internally source ready mixed concrete raw materials from the Company’s legacy aggregates and cement operations. The Company determined fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 2020, the measurement period is closed. The impact of this acquisition is not material to the Company’s operating results; therefore, pro-forma financial information is not included.

% Senior Notes due 

2030

 (the 2.500% Senior Notes). The 2.500% Senior Notes are carried net of original issue discount, which is being amortized by the effective interest method over the life of the issue. The 2.500% Senior Notes are redeemable prior to December 15, 2029 at their make-whole redemption price at a discount rate of the U.S. Treasury Rate plus 

30

 basis points, or on or after December 15, 2029 at a redemption price equal to 

100

% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $

300.0

 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes at maturity in May 2020. At December 31, 2019, the Floating Rate Senior Notes due May 2020 were classified as noncurrent long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as the Company had the intent and ability to refinance the notes on a long-term basis.

The Company has a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Truist Bank, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Co-Syndication Agents, and the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement), which provides for a $

700.0

 million 

five-year

 senior unsecured revolving facility (the Revolving Facility). Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at rates based upon the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or a base rate, plus, for each rate, a margin determined in accordance with a ratings-based pricing grid.

  Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data




The Credit Agreement requires the Company’s ratio of consolidated net debt-to-consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, as defined, for the trailing-twelve months (the Ratio) to not exceed 

3.50

x as of the end of any fiscal quarter, provided that the Company may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions during the quarter or three preceding quarters so long as the Ratio calculated without such exclusion does not exceed 

3.75

x.  Additionally, if no amounts are outstanding under both the Revolving Facility and the trade receivable securitization facility (discussed later), consolidated debt, including debt for which the Company is a co-borrower (see Note O), shall be reduced by the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $

50.0

 million, such reduction not to 

exceed $

200.0

 million, for purposes of the covenant calculation. The Company was in compliance with the Ratio at December 31, 2020.




The Revolving Facility expires on 

December 5, 2024

, with any outstanding principal amounts, together with interest accrued thereon, due in full on that date.  

Available borrowings under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit issued by the Company under the Revolving Facility.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $

2.6

 million and $

2.3

 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility and $

697.4

 million and $

697.7

 million, respectively, available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. The Company paid the bank group an upfront loan 

commitment fee that is being amortized over the life of the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility includes an annual facility fee.




The Company, through a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, has a $

400.0

 million trade receivable securitization facility (the Trade Receivable Facility). On September 23, 2020, the Company extended the maturity to 

September 22, 2021

. The Trade Receivable Facility, with Truist Bank, Regions Bank, PNC Bank, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch, and certain other lenders that may become a party to the facility from time to time, is backed by eligible trade receivables, as defined. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of the facility limit or the borrowing base, as defined. These receivables are originated by the Company and then sold or contributed to the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary. The Company continues to be responsible for the servicing and administration of the receivables purchased by the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary. Borrowings under the Trade Receivable Facility bear interest at a rate equal to asset-backed commercial paper costs of conduit lenders plus 

0.85

% for borrowings funded by conduit lenders and one-month LIBOR plus 

1.00

%, subject to change in the event that this rate no longer reflects the lender’s cost of lending

, 

for borrowings funded by all other lenders

. The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Company’s other debt agreements.  At December 31, 2020, there were 

no

 borrowings outstanding under the Trade Receivable Facility and $

340.0

 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019.

Note I: Financial Instruments 




The Company’s financial instruments include temporary cash investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, publicly-registered long-term notes, debentures and other long-term debt. 




Temporary cash investments are placed primarily in money market funds, money market demand deposit accounts or offshore time deposit accounts with financial institutions. The Company’s cash equivalents have maturities of less than three months. Due 

to the short maturity of these investments, they are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value.

 




Restricted cash is held in a trust account with a third-party intermediary. Due to the short-term nature of this account, the fair value of restricted cash approximates its carrying value.

  Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data




Accounts receivable are due from a large number of customers, primarily in the construction industry, and are dispersed across wide geographic and economic regions. However, accounts receivable are more heavily concentrated in certain states, namely 

Texas, Colorado, North Carolina,

 Georgia and Iowa

. The estimated fair values of accounts receivable approximate their carrying amounts

. 




Notes receivable are primarily promissory notes with customers and are not publicly traded. Management estimates that the fair value of notes receivable approximates its carrying amount. 




Accounts payable represent amounts owed to suppliers and vendors. The estimated fair value of accounts payable approximates its carrying amount due to the short-term nature of the payables. 




The carrying values and fair values of the Company’s long-term debt were $

2.63

 

billion and $

3.08

 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and $

2.77

 billion and $

2.94

 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The estimated fair value of the Company’s publicly-registered long-term debt was estimated based on Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices. The estimated fair values of other borrowings, which primarily represent variable-rate debt, approximate their carrying amounts as the interest rates reset periodically.

The statutory depletion deduction for all years is calculated as a percentage of sales, subject to certain limitations. Due to these limitations, the impact of changes in the sales volumes and earnings may not proportionately affect the Company’s statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate.




In 2020, the Company financed third-party railroad track maintenance. In exchange, the Company received a federal income tax credit and deduction.




The Company recognized a net tax benefit from the change in tax status of a subsidiary from a partnership to a corporation in 2019, which reduced income tax expense and increased consolidated net earnings by $

 million, or $

 per diluted share.

  Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data




Deferred tax liabilities for property, plant and equipment result from accelerated depreciation methods being used for income tax purposes as compared with the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.




Deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill and other intangibles reflect the cessation of goodwill amortization for financial reporting purposes, while amortization continues for income tax purposes.




The Company expects to permanently reinvest the earnings from its wholly-owned Canadian and Bahamian subsidiaries, and accordingly, has not provided deferred taxes on the subsidiaries’ undistributed net earnings or basis differences.  The Company believes that the tax liability that would be incurred upon repatriation is immaterial at December 31, 2020.




The following table summarizes the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and correlative effects of $

0.2

 million, $

1.7

Unrecognized tax benefits are reversed as a discrete event if an examination of applicable tax returns is not initiated by a federal or state tax authority within the statute of limitations or upon effective settlement with federal or state tax authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $

9.7

 million was reversed into income upon the statute of limitations expiration for the 2016 and all prior open tax years. Management believes its accrual for unrecognized tax benefits is sufficient to cover uncertain tax positions reviewed during audits by taxing authorities. 




The Company anticipates that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to $

4.4

 million, excluding interest and correlative effects, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2021, due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations for the 2017 tax year.




The Company’s tax years subject to federal, state or foreign examinations are 2016 through 2020. 




Note K: Retirement Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits 




The Company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans that cover substantially all employees. Additionally, the Company provides other postretirement benefits for certain employees, including medical benefits for retirees and their spouses and 

retiree life insurance. Employees starting on or after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for postretirement welfare plans. The Company also provides certain benefits, such as disability benefits, to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.

  




The measurement date for the Company’s defined benefit plans, postretirement benefit plans and postemployment benefit plans is December 31. 




Defined Benefit Retirement Plans.

 

Retirement plan assets are invested in listed stocks, bonds, hedge funds, real estate and cash equivalents. Defined retirement benefits for salaried employees are based on each employee’s years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Defined retirement benefits for hourly employees are generally stated amounts for specified periods of service. 




The Company sponsors a Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (SERP) that generally provides for the payment of retirement benefits in excess of allowable Internal Revenue Code limits. The SERP generally provides for a lump-sum payment of vested benefits. When these benefit payments exceed the sum of the service and interest costs for the SERP during a year, the Company recognizes a pro rata portion of the SERP’s unrecognized actuarial loss as settlement expense.

These investments are common collective investment trusts valued using the net asset value (NAV) unit price provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund. 




Real estate investments are stated at estimated fair value, which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of real estate

investments generally do not reflect transaction costs 

that

 may be incurred upon disposition of the real estate investments and do not necessarily represent the prices at which the

 

real estate investments would be sold or repaid, since market prices of real estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. An independent valuation consultant is employed to determine the fair value of the real estate investments. The value of hedge funds is based on the values of the sub-fund investments. In determining the fair value of each sub-fund’s investment, the hedge funds’ Board of Trustees uses the values provided by the sub-funds and any other considerations that may, in its judgment, increase or decrease such estimated value. 

Private infrastructure assets represent investments in a fund that is stated at fair value.  For financial assets in the fund that are actively traded in organized financial markets, fair value is based on exchange-quoted market prices.  For investments in the fund for which there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by the Trustees/General Partner based on discounted expected future cash flows prepared by third-party professionals.

Defined Contribution Plan

.

 

The Company maintains a defined contribution plan that covers substantially all employees. This plan, qualified under Section 

401(a)

 of the Internal Revenue Code, is a retirement savings and investment plan for the Company’s salaried and hourly employees

.

 Under certain provisions of the plan, the Company matches employees’ eligible contributions at 

established rates. The Company’s matching obligations were $

17.9

 million in 2020, $

17.6

 million in 2019 and $

16.5

 million in 2018

.




Note L: Stock-Based Compensation 




On May 19, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the Martin Marietta Amended and Restated Stock-Based Award Plan. The Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Stock-Based Award Plan, as amended from time to time, along with the Amended Omnibus Securities Award Plan, originally approved in 1994 (collectively, the Plans), are still effective for awards made prior to 2017. The Company has been authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock for issuance under the stock-based award plans (see Note N). 




The Company grants restricted stock awards under the Plans to a group of executive officers, key personnel and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. The vesting of certain restricted stock awards is based on certain performance criteria over a specified period of time.  The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of those criteria. In addition, certain awards are granted to individuals to encourage retention and motivate key employees. These awards generally vest if the employee is continuously employed over a specified period of time and require no payment from the employee.  Awards granted to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors vest immediately. 




The fair value of stock-based award grants is expensed over the vesting period. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are expensed over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award.  Awards granted to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors are expensed immediately.




Additionally, an incentive compensation stock plan has been adopted under the Plans whereby certain participants may elect to use up to 

50

% of their annual incentive compensation to acquire units representing shares of the Company’s common stock at a 

20

% discount to the market value on the date of the incentive compensation award.  Certain executive officers are required to participate in the incentive compensation stock plan at established minimum levels. Participants receive unrestricted shares of common stock in an amount equal to their respective units generally at the end of a 34-month period of additional employment from the date of award or at retirement beginning at age 62. All rights of ownership of the common stock convey to the participants upon the issuance of their respective shares at the end of the ownership-vesting period.

 million. 

 




Note N: Shareholders’ Equity 




The authorized capital structure of the Company includes 

100.0

 million shares of common stock, with a par value of $

0.01

 per 

share. At December 31, 2020, approximately 

1.4

 million common shares were reserved for issuance under stock-based award plans.




Pursuant to authority granted by its Board of Directors, the Company can repurchase up to 

20.0

 million shares of common stock. The Company repurchased 

0.2

 million, 

0.4

 million and 

0.5

 million shares of common stock during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Future share repurchases are at the discretion of management and were temporarily paused in March 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management may resume share repurchases as circumstances dictate. At December 31, 2020, 

13.5

 million shares of common stock were remaining under the Company’s repurchase authorization.  




Note O: Commitments and Contingencies 




Legal and Administrative Proceedings. 

The Company is engaged in certain legal and administrative proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. In the opinion of management and counsel, based upon currently-available facts, the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcome of any litigation and other proceedings, including those pertaining to environmental matters (see Note A), relating to the Company and its subsidiaries, will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the Company’s operations, its cash flows or its financial position. 




Asset Retirement Obligations. 

The Company incurs reclamation and teardown costs as part of its mining and production processes. Estimated future obligations are discounted to their present value and accreted to their projected future obligations via charges to operating expenses. Additionally, the fixed assets recorded concurrently with the liabilities are depreciated over the period until retirement activities are expected to occur. Total accretion and depreciation expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $

14.5

 million, $

9.1

 million and $

8.0

 million, respectively, and are included in 

Other

 

operating income, net

, in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Other Environmental Matters

. 

The Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters. Certain of the Company’s operations may, from time to time, involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental remediation liability is inherent in the operation of the Company’s businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. The Company has no material provisions for environmental remediation liabilities and does not believe such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future. 




Insurance Reserves.

 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, reserves of $

37.7

 million and $

 million in letters of credit.




Surety Bonds.

 

At December 31, 2020, the Company was contingently liable for $

390.2

 million in surety bonds required by certain states and municipalities and their related agencies. The bonds are provided in the normal course of business and are principally for certain insurance claims, construction contracts, reclamation obligations and mining permits guaranteeing the Company’s own performance. The Company has indemnified the underwriting insurance company against any exposure under the surety bonds.  In the Company’s past experience, no material claims have been made against these financial instruments.




Borrowing Arrangements with Affiliate. 

The Company is a co-borrower with an unconsolidated affiliate for a $

12.5

 million revolving line of credit agreement with Truist Bank, of which $

8.4

 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The line of credit matures in 

March 2022

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a $

6.0

 million interest-only note receivable from the unconsolidated affiliate due

Note P: Segments 




During 2020, the Company made organizational changes to its Building Materials business. As of December 31, 2020, the Building Materials business is comprised of 

four

 divisions that represent individual operating segments. These divisions are consolidated into 

two

 reportable segments, the East Group and the West Group, for financial reporting purposes as they meet the aggregation criteria. Additional information on reportable segment changes is provided in Note A. Prior-year reportable segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. The Magnesia Specialties business represents an individual operating and reportable segment. The accounting policies used for segment reporting are the 

same as those described in Note

 A.




The Chief Operating Decision Maker’s evaluation of performance and allocation of resources are based primarily on earnings from operations. Consolidated earnings from operations include total revenues less cost of revenues; selling, general and administrative expenses; acquisition-related expenses, net; other operating income, net; and excludes interest expense; other nonoperating income and expenses, net; and income tax expense. Corporate loss from operations primarily includes depreciation; expenses for corporate administrative functions; acquisition-related expenses, net; and other nonrecurring income and expenses excluded from the Company’s evaluation of segment performance and resource allocation. All long-term debt and related interest expense are held at Corporate. 




Assets employed by segment include assets directly identified with those operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash; property, plant and equipment for corporate operations; investments and other assets not directly identifiable with a reportable segment.

ITEM 9 – CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE




None.




 




ITEM 9A – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




As of December 31, 2020, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.




The foregoing evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting




Our management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included as the “Statement of Financial Responsibility and Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting” in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” of this Form 10-K.  The Company’s management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of December 31, 2020.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained herein, also audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. The audit report is included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Form 10-K.  




Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.




Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls




The Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
