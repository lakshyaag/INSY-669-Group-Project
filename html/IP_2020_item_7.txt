EQUITY EARNINGS, NET OF TAXES

Equity earnings, net of taxes, consisted principally of the Company’s share of earnings from its 50% investment in Ilim of $48 million

 

and $207 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and from its 15.0% ownership interest at December 31, 2020 in GPIP of $40 million in 2020, and from its 20.5%

 

ownership interest at December 31, 2019 of $46 million in 2019 (see page 30).

INTEREST EXPENSE AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST

Net corporate interest expense totaled $444 million in 2020 and $491 million in 2019. Net interest expense in 2020 includes $2 million of interest income associated with a foreign value-added tax refund accrual. Net interest expense in 2019 includes $3 million of interest income associated with a foreign value-added tax refund accrual and $1 million of interest expense related to foreign tax audits. The decrease in 2020 compared with 2019 was due to lower average outstanding debt. 

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were zero in 2020, compared with a loss of $5 million in 2019. The loss in 2019 includes the allocation of loss of $9 million associated with the impairment of the net assets of our India Papers business.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

International Paper’s business segments discussed below are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the forest products industry.

INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING

International Paper is the largest manufacturer of containerboard in the United States. Our U.S. production capacity is over 13 million tons annually. Our products include linerboard, medium, whitetop, recycled linerboard, recycled medium and saturating kraft. About 80% of our production is converted into corrugated boxes and other packaging by our 174 North American container plants. Additionally, we recycle approximately one million tons of OCC and mixed and white paper through our 18 recycling plants. Our container plants are supported by regional design centers, which offer total packaging solutions and supply chain initiatives. In EMEA, our operations include one recycled fiber containerboard mill in Morocco, a recycled containerboard mill in Spain and 27 container plants in France, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Turkey and Portugal. On January 5, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Mondi Group to sell its 90.38% ownership interest in Olmuksan International Paper, a corrugated packaging business in Turkey.

.

International Paper also produces high quality coated paperboard for a variety of packaging end uses with 443,000 tons of annual capacity at our mills in Poland and Russia.

GLOBAL CELLULOSE FIBERS

Our cellulose fibers product portfolio includes fluff, market and specialty pulps. International Paper is the largest producer of fluff pulp which is used to make absorbent hygiene products like baby diapers,  feminine care, adult incontinence and other non-woven products. Our market pulp is used for tissue and paper products. We continue to invest in exploring new innovative uses for our products, such as our specialty pulps, which are used for non-absorbent end uses including textiles, filtration, construction material, paints and coatings, reinforced plastics and more. Our products are made in the United States, Canada, France, Poland, and Russia and are sold around the world. International Paper facilities have annual dried pulp capacity of about 4 million metric tons.

PRINTING PAPERS

International Paper is one of the world’s largest producers of printing and writing papers. The primary product in this segment is uncoated papers. This business produces papers for use in copiers, desktop and laser printers and digital imaging. End-use applications include advertising and promotional materials such as brochures, pamphlets, greeting cards, books, annual reports and direct mail. Uncoated papers also produces a variety of grades that are converted by our customers into envelopes, tablets, business forms and file folders. Uncoated papers are sold under private label and International Paper brand names that include 

Hammermill, Springhill, Williamsburg, Postmark, Accent, Great White, Chamex, Ballet

, 

Rey, Pol, and Svetocopy

. The mills producing uncoated papers are located in the United States, France, Poland, Russia and Brazil. The mills have uncoated paper production capacity of over 4 million tons annually. Brazilian operations function through International Paper do Brasil, Ltda, which owns or manages approximately 314,000 acres of forestlands in Brazil. On December 3, 2020, the Company announced a plan to pursue a spin-off of the Printing Papers segment into SpinCo, a standalone, publicly-traded company. The transaction will be implemented through the distribution of SpinCo shares to International Paper shareholders. We expect the transaction to be tax-free for International Paper's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. International Paper will retain approximately 19.9% of the shares of SpinCo at the time of the separation, with the intent to monetize and provide additional proceeds to International Paper. The transaction is expected to close late in the third quarter of 2021 and is subject to customary conditions, including final approval by the International Paper board of directors and the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC.

ILIM

In October 2007, International Paper and Ilim completed a 50:50 joint venture to operate a pulp and paper business located in Russia. Ilim’s facilities include three paper mills located in Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk, and Koryazhma, Russia, with combined total pulp and paper capacity of over 3.6 million metric tons. Ilim has exclusive harvesting rights on timberland and forest areas exceeding 19.8 million acres (8.01 million hectares).

GPIP 

On January 1, 2018, the Company completed the transfer of its North American Consumer Packaging business, which includes its North American Coated Paperboard and Foodservice businesses, to Graphic Packaging International Partners, LLC ("GPIP"), a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Holding Company, in exchange for a 20.5% ownership interest in GPIP. GPIP subsequently transferred the North American Consumer Packaging business to Graphic Packaging International, LLC ("GPI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIP that holds the assets of the combined business. 

On January 29, 2020, the Company exchanged 15,150,784 units of the aggregate units owned by the Company for an aggregated price of $250 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $33 million ($25 million after taxes) which was recorded in the first quarter of 2020. On August 7, 2020, the Company exchanged 17,399,414 units of the aggregate units owned by the Company for an aggregated price of $250 million, resulting in an immaterial gain which was recorded in the third quarter of 2020. After these transactions, the Company's ownership percentage in GPIP is approximately 15%. See

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The following tables present net sales and operating profit (loss) which is the Company's measure of segment profitability.

INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING

Demand for Industrial Packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production, as well as with demand for e-commerce, processed foods, poultry, meat and agricultural products. In addition to prices and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of Industrial Packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, mill outage costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

net sales for 2020 decreased 2% to $15.0 billion compared with $15.3 billion in 2019. Operating profits in 2020 were 12% lower than in 2019. Comparing 2020 with 2019, benefits from higher sales volumes ($66 million), lower input costs ($125 million) and lower maintenance outage costs ($56 million) were more than offset by lower average sales price and an unfavorable mix ($431 million) and higher operating costs ($73 million).

North American Industrial Packaging's 

sales volumes increased in 2020 compared with 2019 for boxes driven by strong demand in certain customer segments including e-commerce and shipping and distribution, reflecting the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Export containerboard sales volumes also increased. Total maintenance and economic downtime was about 942,000 tons lower in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to economic downtime. Average sales prices were lower for both export containerboard and box. Operating costs increased primarily due to inflation and costs related to the Riverdale conversion. Planned maintenance downtime costs were $60 million lower in 2020 than in 2019. Input costs were lower, driven by lower wood and energy costs partially offset by higher recovered fiber costs.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2021, compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, sales volumes for boxes are expected to be stable, with strong box demand offset by one less shipping day in the first quarter. Average sales margins are expected to be higher. Operating costs are expected to be lower. Planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be $87 million higher. Input costs are expected to be higher primarily for recovered fiber, wood and energy.

 sales volumes in 2020 were higher than in 2019, despite the negative demand impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which was more than offset by improved economic conditions in Turkey and the full-year impact of 2019 acquisitions. Average sales margins improved 

significantly in all regions driven by lower containerboard costs and stable sales prices for boxes. Operating costs were lower, driven by the ramp-up of the Madrid, Spain mill and improved box plant operations partially offset by inflation in Turkey. Planned maintenance outage costs were $3 million higher in 2020 compared with 2019. Other input costs were lower. Earnings were negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency impacts in Turkey.  

Entering the first quarter of 2021, compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, sales volumes are expected to be seasonally higher. Average sales margins are expected to be lower, reflecting higher input costs. Operating costs are expected to be lower. Planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be flat due to no outages in the fourth quarter and no planned outages in the first quarter. Input costs are expected to be stable.

EQUITY EARNINGS, NET OF TAXES - ILIM

International Paper accounts for its investment in Ilim, a separate reportable industry segment, using the equity method of accounting.

The Company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, related to Ilim of $48 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $207 million in 2019. Operating results recorded in 2020 included an after-tax non-cash foreign exchange loss of $50 million, compared with an after-tax foreign exchange gain of $32 million in 2019, primarily on the remeasurement of Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt.

Driven by the newly modernized Ust Ilimsk pulp line and the upgraded Bratsk containerboard machine, sales volumes for the joint venture increased by 9% in 2020, primarily for softwood pulp shipments to China, Russia and other export markets, partially offset by lower shipments of hardwood pulp to China and Russia. Average sales price margins were significantly lower for sales of softwood pulp, hardwood pulp and containerboard in all areas. Input costs were higher, primarily for wood. Distribution costs were negatively impacted by transportation tariffs and inflation. Maintenance and repair expenses were higher. The Company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $141 million in 2020 and $246 million in 2019.

Entering the first quarter of 2021, sales volumes are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to the New Year holidays in China and other seasonal factors. Based on results to date in 

30

Tab

le of Contents

the current quarter, average margins are expected to increase for softwood pulp, hardwood pulp and containerboard. Input costs and distribution costs are projected to be relatively flat.

EQUITY EARNINGS - GPIP

International Paper recorded equity earnings of $40 million in 2020 and $46 million in 2019 on its ownership position in GPIP.  The Company received cash dividends from the investment of $20 million in 2020 and $27 million in 2019. See Description of Business Segments on pages 26 and 27 for further detail regarding our ownership interest in GPIP. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

A  major factor in International Paper’s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. While changes in key operating cash costs, such as raw material, energy, mill outage and distribution, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence, as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.

Use of cash during 2020 was primarily focused on capital spending, debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Cash provided by operations totaled $3.1 billion in 2020, compared with $3.6 billion for 2019. Cash provided by working capital components (accounts receivable, contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other) totaled $324 million in 2020, compared with cash provided by working capital components of $342 million in 2019. Cash dividends received from equity investments were $162 million in 2020, compared with $273 million in 2019. 

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

Cash outflows from investment activities in 2020 decreased from 2019, as 2019 included higher capital spending. The Company made a concerted effort to control spending in 2020 and will continue to do so throughout 2021. Capital spending was $751 million in 2020, or 58% of depreciation and amortization, compared with $1.3 billion in 2019, or 98% of depreciation and amortization. Across our segments, capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization ranged from 35.8% to 63.6% in 2020.

addition to these debt tenders, the Company had early debt extinguishments of approximately $152 million from open market repurchases related to debt with interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 4.40% and maturities dates from 2026 to 2048. 

The Company had debt issuances in 2020 of $583 million related primarily to the AR securitization program and international debt. In addition to the early debt reductions, the Company had debt reductions of $638 million in 2020 related primarily to the AR securitization program, commercial paper, and international debt.

Other financing activities during 2020 included the net issuance of approximately one million shares of treasury stock. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $42 million, including $14 million related to shares repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program. The Company has repurchased 69.3 million shares at an average price of $47.17, for a total of approximately $3.3 billion, since the repurchase program began in September 2013 through December 31, 2020. The Company paid cash dividends totaling $806 million during 2020.

Other financing activities during 2019 included the net repurchase of approximately 8.5 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock tax withholding. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled  $535 million, including $485 million related to shares repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program. The Company paid cash dividends totaling $796 million during 2019.

Interest Rate Swaps

Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk, International Paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt. During the first quarter of 2020, International Paper terminated its interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700 million and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2026 with an approximate fair value of $85 million. Subsequent to the termination of the interest rate swaps, the fair value basis adjustment is amortized to earnings as interest income over the same period as a debt premium on the previously hedged debt (see 

Note 17 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

 on pages 73 through 77 of 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

). At December 31, 2019 the Company had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700 million and during 2019, the inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short term investments reduced the effective interest rate from 4.8% to 4.4%.

Variable Interest Entities

Information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in 

Note 15 Variable Interest Entities

 on pages 70 through 72 of  

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

. In connection with the 2006 International Paper installment sale of forestlands, we received $4.8 billion of installment notes. These installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from third-party lenders. These variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 when the installment notes and third-party loans were extended. The restructured variable interest entities hold installment notes of $4.8 billion that mature in August 2021 and third-party loans of $4.2 billion, which, as a result of an extension in November 2020, mature in August 2021. These installment notes and third-party loans are shown in Current nonrecourse financial assets of variable interest entities and Current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities, respectively, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. We will settle the third-party loans at their maturity in August 2021 with the proceeds from the installment notes which also mature in August 2021 resulting in expected cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 billion representing our equity in the variable interest entities. Maturity of the installment notes and termination of the monetization structure is expected to result in a $75 million cash tax payment in 2021.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OUTLOOK FOR 2021

We expect another year of solid cash generation in 2021. Furthermore, we intend to continue to make choices for the use of cash that are consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive long-term value creation. These include maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making organic investments to maintain our world-class system and strengthen our packaging business.

Under our share repurchase program most recently approved by our Board of Directors on October 9, 2018, which does not have an expiration date, approximately $1.73 billion aggregate amount of shares of common stock remains authorized for purchase under this program.  We may continue to repurchase shares under such authorization in open market transactions (including block trades), privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, restrictions in our debt documents, applicable securities laws requirements and other factors. In addition, we pay regular quarterly cash dividends and expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Each quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and is subject to restrictions in our debt documents.

Capital Expenditures and Long-Term Debt

Capital spending for 2021 is planned at approximately $800 million, or about 61% of depreciation and amortization.

At December 31, 2020, International Paper’s credit agreements totaled $2.8 billion, which is comprised of the $750 million contractually committed revolving credit agreement, the $1.5 billion contractually committed bank credit agreement, and up to $550 million under the receivables securitization program. Management believes these credit agreements are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle. The credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon International Paper’s credit rating. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the $750 million revolving credit agreement, the $1.5 billion credit agreement, or the $550 million receivables securitization program. The Company’s credit agreements are not subject to any restrictive covenants other than the financial covenants as disclosed on pages 72 and 73 in 

Note 16 - Debt and Lines of Credit

 of 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, and the borrowings under the receivables securitization program being limited by eligible receivables. The Company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at December 31, 2020 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements. Further the financial covenants do not restrict any borrowings under the credit agreements. After considering the Company’s liquidity position in relation to COVID-19 and the current economic environment, the Company's receivable securitization program was amended from a committed financing arrangement to an uncommitted financing arrangement in February 2021 with the borrowing limit and expiration date remaining unchanged.”

In addition to the $2.8 billion in credit agreements, International Paper has a commercial paper program with a borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion. Under the terms of the program, individual maturities on borrowings may vary, but not exceed one year from the date of issue. Interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes. The Company had no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and $30 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019, under this program.

International Paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements for the next 12 months with current cash balances and cash from operations, supplemented as required by its existing credit facilities. The Company will continue to rely on debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. Funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. The primary goals of the Company’s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and maintain appropriate levels of liquidity to meet our needs while managing balance sheet debt and interest expense. The majority of International Paper’s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors. During 2020, management took various actions to further strengthen the Company’s liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the Company amending its receivable securitization program from an uncommitted financing arrangement to a committed financing arrangement in April 2020 and also  deferring the payment of our payroll taxes as allowed under CARES Act. The CARES Act allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer portion of Social Security taxes accrued between March 27, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Under the CARES Act 50% of the deferred payroll taxes will be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remainder will be paid by December 31, 2022. We believe that our credit agreements, commercial paper program, and the actions taken in response to COVID-19  provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate in this uncertain environment; however, an extended period of economic disruption could impact our access to additional sources of liquidity.

Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of International Paper’s financing strategy. At December 31, 2020, the Company held long-term credit ratings of BBB (stable outlook) and Baa2 (stable outlook) by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.

Contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at December 31, 2020, were as follows:

We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020, to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon (see 

Note 13 Income Taxes

 on pages 65 through 68 of I

tem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

). We do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.

The Company expects significant cash generation through various transactions in 2021 including the sale of the Kwidzyn, Poland mill, further monetization of our investment in Graphic Packaging,  the Printing Papers spin-off, the unwind of the 2005 timber monetization structure and the sale of its ownership interest in Olmuksan International Paper. We will deploy this cash in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework by maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and investing in opportunities that generate returns above our cost of capital and grow earnings and cash.  

Pension Obligations and Funding

At December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans determined under U.S. GAAP was approximately $1.0 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets, excluding non-U.S. plans. Approximately $595 million of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. Under current IRS funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits (the "projected benefit obligation") for accounting purposes. In December 2008, the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 ("WERA") was passed by the U.S. Congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. Funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the Company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2018, 2019 or 2020. At this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2021, although the Company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. The timing and 

amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.  

ILIM SHAREHOLDER'S AGREEMENT

In October 2007, in connection with the formation of the Ilim joint venture, International Paper entered into a shareholder’s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. This agreement provides that at any time, either the Company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement. If these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholder's agreement are commenced, although it is not obligated to do so, the Company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners' 50% interest in Ilim. Any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by Russian and other relevant antitrust authorities. Based on the provisions of the agreement, the Company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% interests would be approximately $700 million, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or International Paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the Company's option. The purchase by the Company of its partners’ 50% interest in Ilim would result in the consolidation of Ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods. The parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder’s agreement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires International Paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of International Paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and income taxes. The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of 

34

Tab

le of Contents

the Company’s Board of Directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.

While we have taken into account certain impacts arising from COVID-19 in connection with the accounting estimates reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, we have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be affected.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Accruals for contingent liabilities, including personal injury, product liability, environmental, asbestos and other legal matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. Liabilities for asbestos-related matters require reviews of recent and historical claims data. The Company utilizes its in-house legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal, environmental and asbestos obligations, supplemented as needed by third-party specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities.

We calculate our workers' compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. The workers' compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the ultimate settlement of workers' compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL

An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from future operations or disposals. A goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 

value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally, evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually. The amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management’s best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets. As these key factors change in future periods, the Company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections.

ASU 2011-08, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If a qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that, based on that qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value.

The Company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test for its North America Industrial Packaging, EMEA Industrial Packaging, European Papers, Russian Papers, and Brazilian Papers reporting units as of October 1, 2020. The Company elected to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units due to the current economic environment.  The quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed by comparing the carrying amount of each respective reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The Company calculated the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units with goodwill using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates. The determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") multiples.  The results of our annual impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of any reporting units. For our EMEA Packaging reporting unit, the fair value exceeded the carrying amount by 13%. While the reporting unit’s forecasted results support the fair value, significant changes in or inability to achieve the forecasts could result in the impairment of all or a portion of the reporting unit’s $70 million goodwill balance as of December 31, 2020. While the Printing Papers 

35

Tab

le of Contents

segment has experienced a significant decline in demand for its products in the current year as a result of COVID-19, the Company has determined the fair values for those reporting units have not been materially impacted based on management's cumulative long-term outlook and forecasts, which are inherently subjective given the uncertainty around the duration and magnitude of the economic impact of COVID-19.  Currently all of our Printing Papers reporting units fair values exceed carrying values by more than 85%.  

In addition, the Company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation. In consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to October 1, 2020.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit, and it was  determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit, totaling $52 million, was impaired. This impairment charge was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019. The decline in the fair value of Global Cellulose Fibers and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the outlook of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit's operations. 

PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

The charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with International Paper’s consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates.

The calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities.

Benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2020, for International Paper’s pension plan were as follows:

International Paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on December 31 of each year or more frequently if required, to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 7.00%.

Increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2021 pension expense by approximately $28 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $27 million.

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits,” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense

The decrease in 2020 pension expense primarily reflects a higher return on assets and lower interest costs slightly offset by higher service cost.

Assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of December 31, 2020, projected future net periodic pension plan expense (income) would be as follows:

The Company estimates that it will record net pension income of approximately $114 million for its U.S. defined benefit plans in 2021, compared to expense of $32 million in 2020. The estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2021 is primarily due to higher return on assets, lower interest cost and lower amortization of actuarial losses partially offset by higher service cost.

The market value of plan assets for International Paper’s U.S. qualified pension plan at December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $12.0 billion, consisting of approximately 40% equity securities, 48% debt securities, 7% real estate funds and 5% other assets. The Company’s funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. There were no required contributions to the U.S. qualified plan in 2020. The nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which 

totaled $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

INCOME TAXES

International Paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.

While International Paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

on our operating results in each of the last three years. Sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS

International Paper has operations in a number of countries. Its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of international operations’ local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). In general, a weaker U.S. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to International Paper. The currencies that have the most impact are the Euro, the Brazilian real, the Polish zloty and the Russian ruble.

MARKET RISK

We use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. Information related to International Paper’s debt obligations is included in 

Note 16 Debt and Lines of Credit

 on pages 72 and 73 of 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

. A discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in 

Note 17 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

 on pages 73 through 77 of 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.

The fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. We assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. We invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AAA and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. Our investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. Our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.

We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. Derivative instruments, such as, interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $9.3 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $443 million and $511 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

The objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. Commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net fair value of these contracts was immaterial and the potential loss in fair value from a 10% adverse change in quoted commodity prices for these contracts was also immaterial.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

International Paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. Our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. We address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a $3 million liability and a $16 million asset, respectively. The 

38

potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately $26 million and $87 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON:

Financial Statements

The management of International Paper Company is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management has also prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments. Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report. We have formed a Disclosure Committee to oversee this process.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP. During its audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board. Management believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of International Paper Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules (13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance 

of achieving the designed control objectives. The Company’s internal control system is supported by written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Our procedures for financial reporting include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit and Finance Committee and our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals.

The Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, it used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report appears on pages 44 and 45.

Internal Control Environment And Board Of Directors Oversight

Our internal control environment includes an enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness that establishes a positive “tone at the top.” This is exemplified by our ethics program that includes long-standing principles and policies on ethical business conduct that require employees to maintain the highest ethical and legal standards in the conduct of International Paper business, which have been distributed to all employees; a toll-free telephone helpline whereby any employee may anonymously report suspected violations of law or International Paper’s policy; and an office of ethics and business practice. The internal control system further includes careful selection and training of supervisory and management personnel, appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility, dissemination of accounting and business policies throughout International Paper, and an extensive program of internal audits with management follow-up.

The Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit and Finance Committee ("Committee"), monitors the integrity of the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting procedures, the performance of the Company’s internal audit function and independent auditors, and other matters set forth in its charter. The Committee, which consists of independent directors, 

40

Tab

le of Contents

meets regularly with representatives of management, and with the independent auditors and the Internal Auditor, with and without management representatives in attendance, to review their activities. The Committee’s Charter takes into account the New York Stock Exchange rules relating to Audit Committees and the SEC rules and regulations promulgated as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, including critical accounting policies and significant management judgments, with management and the independent auditors. The Committee’s report recommending the inclusion of such financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be set forth in our Proxy Statement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of International Paper Company: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the 

amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Goodwill — Printing Papers Reportable Segment — Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s evaluation of goodwill associated with the Printing Papers reportable segment for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow model and the market approach. The determination of the fair value using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates. The determination of the fair value using the market approach requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiples.  The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2020. Because the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values, no impairments were recorded. As of December 31, 2020, the Printing Papers reportable segment’s goodwill was $201 million. 

We identified the Company’s impairment evaluations of goodwill for the Printing Papers reportable segment, specifically related to the Brazil Papers and European Papers reporting units, as a critical audit matter.  Given reductions in cash flows caused by a substantial decline in demand for printing papers across all geographic regions and given the uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of 

42

Tab

le of Contents

the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management and its specialists’ estimates and assumptions related to the discount rate, forecasted  future revenues and operating margins, and revenue and adjusted EBITDA multiples, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenues and operating profit margins ("forecasts"), revenue and adjusted EBITDA multiples, and selection of discount rates for the Brazil Papers and European Papers reporting units, included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to management’s selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenue and operating margin.

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and operating margins by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group.

•

We considered the impact of changes in the operating environment on management’s forecasts, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the long-term demand for the Company’s products.  

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the discount rates, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the revenue and adjusted EBITDA multiples, including testing the underlying source information and 

mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and comparing the multiples selected by management to its guideline companies.

Retirement Plans — Plan Assets — Refer to Note 19 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s Pension Plans held approximately $2.5 billion in investments whose reported value is determined based on net asset value (“NAV”). The strategic asset allocation policy prescribed by the Company’s Pension Plan includes permissible investments in certain hedge funds, private equity funds, and real estate funds whose reported values are determined based on the estimated NAV of each investment.  

These NAVs are generally determined by the Pension Plan’s third-party administrators or fund managers and are subject to review and oversight by management of the Company and its third-party investment advisors. 

Given a lack of a readily determinable value of these investments and the subjective nature of the valuation methodologies and unobservable inputs used in these methodologies, auditing the NAV associated with these investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve professionals in our firm having expertise in alternative investments.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the determination of NAV associated with the Company’s Pension Plan’s investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, and real estate funds included the following, among others: 

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s determination and evaluation of NAV, including those related to the reliability of NAVs reported by third-party administrators and fund managers. 

•

We inquired of management and the investment advisors regarding changes to the investment portfolio and investment strategies. 

•

We obtained a confirmation from the third-party custodian as of December 31, 2020 of all individual investments held in trust for the Pension Plan to confirm the existence of each individual asset held in trust. 

43

Tab

le of Contents

•

For each selected investment fund with a fiscal year end of December 31, we performed a retrospective review in which we compared the estimated fair value recorded by the Company in the December 31, 2019 financial statements, to the actual fair value of the fund (using the per-share NAV disclosed in the fund’s subsequently issued audited financial statements), to evaluate the appropriateness of management’s estimation process.

•

With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in alternative investments, we rolled forward the valuation from the selected funds’ most recently audited financial statements to December 31, 2020. This roll forward procedure included consideration of the Company’s transactions in the fund during the period, as well as an estimate of the funds’ returns based on an appropriate, independently obtained benchmark or index. We then compared our independent fund valuation estimate to the December 31, 2020, balance recorded by the Company. For certain selected funds, our roll forward procedures included alternative procedures, such as inspecting trust statements for observable transactions near year-end to compare to the estimated fair value.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of International Paper Company":

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of International Paper Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 

44

Tab

le of Contents

expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS

International Paper (the "Company") is a global paper and packaging company with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, North Africa and Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to available industry capacity and general economic conditions.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Since that time, most of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic. The health and safety of our employees and contractors is our most important responsibility as we manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented work-systems across the Company, including hygiene, social distancing, site cleaning, contact tracing, and other measures, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and WHO. Our COVID-19 measures are proving to be effective and we have not had any material disruptions to our operations.

We have seen a significant negative impact on demand for our printing papers products. Demand for our pulp, containerboard and corrugated box products has not been negatively impacted by COVID-19 to date, but our operations in Industrial Packaging experienced higher supply chain costs due to the impacts of COVID-19. The recent resurgence of the virus in many areas has led to additional governmental measures, such as stay-at-home orders or business and school closures, negatively impacting our supply chain, and therefore our production.

There continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to the various economic reopening plans and the resurgence of the virus in many areas; additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and private businesses to attempt to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or to mitigate its impact; the extent and duration of social distancing and stay-at-home orders; the efficacy and availability of various vaccines; and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on unemployment, economic activity and consumer confidence. Developments related to 

COVID-19 are significantly adversely affecting portions of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly if negative global economic conditions persist for a significant period of time or deteriorate.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require the use of management’s estimates. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Paper and subsidiaries for which we have a controlling financial interest, including variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

The equity method of accounting is applied for investments when the Company has significant influence over the investee’s operations, or when the investee is structured with separate capital accounts. Our material equity method investments are described in 

Note 11

.

  

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

The Company allocates the total consideration of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the business combination date. In developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, the Company utilizes a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows, anticipated growth rates, discount rates, estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors. Determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets such as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment. We may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statement of operations. Subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change, requiring us to record impairment charges or adjust their economic lives in future periods. See 

Note 7

 for further details.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

A discontinued operation may include a component or a group of components of the Company's operations. A disposal of a component or a group of components is reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results when the following occurs: (1) a component (or group of components) meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale; (2) the component or group of components is disposed of by sale; or (3) the component or group of components is disposed of other than by sale (for example, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spin-off).

 

For any component classified as held for sale or disposed of by sale or other than by sale, qualifying for presentation as a discontinued operation, the Company reports the results of operations of the discontinued operations (including any gain or loss recognized on the disposal or loss recognized on classification as held for sale of a discontinued operation), less applicable income taxes (benefit), as a separate component in the consolidated statement of operations for current and all prior periods presented.

RESTRUCTURING     LIABILITIES AND COSTS

For operations to be closed or restructured, a liability and related expense is recorded in the period when operations cease. For termination costs associated with employees covered by a written or substantive plan, a liability is recorded when it is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For termination costs associated with employees not covered by a written and broadly communicated policy covering involuntary termination benefits (severance plan), a liability is recorded for costs to terminate employees (one-time termination benefits) when the termination plan has been approved and committed to by management, the employees to be terminated have been identified, the termination plan benefit terms are communicated, the employees identified in the plan have been notified and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The timing and amount of an accrual is dependent upon the type of benefits granted, the timing of communication and other provisions that may be provided in the benefit plan. The accounting for each termination is evaluated individually. See 

Note 6

 for further details.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Generally, the Company recognizes revenue on a point-in-time basis when the customer takes title to the goods and assumes the risks and rewards for the 

goods. For customized goods where the Company has a legally enforceable right to payment for the goods, the Company recognizes revenue over time, which generally is, as the goods are produced. 

The Company’s revenue is primarily derived from fixed consideration; however, we do have contract terms that give rise to variable consideration, primarily volume rebates, early payment discounts and other customer refunds. The Company estimates its volume rebates at the individual customer level based on the most likely amount method outlined in ASC 606. The Company estimates early payment discounts and other customer refunds based on the historical experience across the Company's portfolio of customers to record reductions in revenue which is consistent with the expected value method outlined in ASC 606. Management has concluded that these methods result in the best estimate of the consideration the Company will be entitled to from its customers.

The Company has elected to present all sales taxes on a net basis, account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset the Company would recognize is one year or less, and not record interest income or interest expense when the difference in timing of control or transfer and customer payment is one year or less. See 

Note 3

 for further details.

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

Temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less and money market funds with greater than three month maturities but with the right to redeem without notice are treated as cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market value. See 

Note 9

 for further details.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. In the United States, costs of raw materials and finished pulp and paper products, are generally determined using the last-in, first-out method. Other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods. See 

Note 9

 for further details.

LEASED ASSETS

Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over 

52

Tab

le of Contents

the lease term. The Company's leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options to extend are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Some leases have variable payments, however, because they are not based on an index or rate, they are not included in the ROU assets and liabilities. Variable payments for real estate leases primarily relate to common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities. Variable payments for equipment, vehicles, and leases within supply agreements primarily relate to usage, repairs and maintenance. As the implicit rate is not readily determinable for most of the Company's leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach using an estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the initial present value of lease payments over the lease terms on a collateralized basis over a similar term, which is based on market and company specific information. We use the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjust that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, and apply the rate based on the currency of the lease, which is updated on a quarterly basis for measurement of new lease liabilities. Leases having a lease term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition, the Company has applied the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases. See 

Note 10

 for further details.

PLANTS, PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

Plants, properties and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized, whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The units-of-production method of depreciation is used for pulp and paper mills, and the straight-line method is used for other plants and equipment. See 

Note 9

 for further details.

GOODWILL

Annual evaluation for possible goodwill impairment is performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, with additional interim evaluation performed when management believes that it is more likely than not, that events or circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill.

The Company has the option to evaluate goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative   assessment of events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or 

circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company does not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, the Company is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In performing this evaluation, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. The determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates.  The determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") multiples. The results of our annual impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of any reporting units. For reporting units whose carrying amount is in excess of their estimated fair value, the reporting unit will record an impairment charge by the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. See 

Note 12

 for further discussion.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A recoverability test is performed based on undiscounted cash flows, requiring judgments as to whether assets are held and used or held for sale, the weighting of operational alternatives being considered by management and estimates of the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from the use of the long-lived assets generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value. See 

Note 8

 for further discussion.

INCOME TAXES

International Paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those 

53

Tab

le of Contents

temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted.

International Paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Company’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, a change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

While the judgments and estimates made by the Company are based on management’s evaluation of the technical merits of a matter, assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants, historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts, resulting in adjustments that could materially affect future financial statements. See 

Note 13

 for further details.

International Paper uses the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits earned on eligible open-loop biomass facilities and combined heat and power system expenditures. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year they are earned rather than a reduction in the asset basis.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

Costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable. See 

Note 14

 for further details.

TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Balance sheets of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, while statements of operations are translated at average rates. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

NOTE 2 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Other than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Income Taxes

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes." This guidance removes certain exceptions from recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. It also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The Company early adopted the provisions of this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2020 with no material impact.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." This guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment method with a method that reflects expected credit losses. The Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2020. As a result of using this approach, the Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $

2

 million to the opening balance of retained earnings representing the adjustment to our opening allowance for doubtful accounts required to state our trade receivables and contract assets net of their expected credit losses, net of deferred taxes.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

Reference Rate Reform

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting." This guidance provides companies with 

optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. This guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.

REVENUE CONTRACT BALANCES

A contract asset is created when the Company recognizes revenue on its customized products prior to having an unconditional right to payment from the customer, which generally does not occur until title and risk of loss passes to the customer.

A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The majority of our customer prepayments are received during the fourth quarter each year for goods that will be transferred to customers over the following twelve months. Current liabilities of $

31

 million and $

56

 million are included in Other current liabilities in the accompanying condense consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the difference between the price and quantity at comparable points in time for goods which we have an unconditional right to payment or receive prepayment from the customer, respectively.

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS

International Paper's principal business is to manufacture and sell fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper goods. As a general rule, none of our businesses provide equipment installation or other ancillary services outside of producing and shipping packaging, pulp and paper goods to customers. 

The nature of the Company's contracts can vary based on the business, customer type and region; however, in all instances it is International Paper's customary business practice to receive a valid order from the customer, in which each parties' rights and related payment terms are clearly identifiable. 

Contracts or purchase orders with customers could include a single type of product or it could include 

multiple types/grades of products. Regardless, the contracted price with the customer is agreed to at the individual product level outlined in the customer contracts or purchase orders. The Company does not 

bundle prices; however, we do negotiate with customers on pricing and rebates for the same products based on a variety of factors (e.g. level of contractual volume, geographical location, etc.). Management has concluded that the prices negotiated with each individual customer are representative of the stand-alone selling price of the product.

NOTE 4 EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities were converted into common shares.

There are no adjustments required to be made to net income for purposes of computing basic and diluted EPS.

A reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of basic earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations is as follows:

NOTE 8 DIVESTITURES AND IMPAIRMENTS OF BUSINESSES

PRINTING PAPERS SPIN-OFF

2020:

  On December 3, 2020, the Company announced a plan to pursue a spin-off of the Company's Printing Papers segment into a standalone, publicly-traded company. The transaction will be implemented through the distribution of  shares of the standalone company to International Paper shareholders. International Paper will retain up to 

19.9

% of the shares of the standalone company at the time of the separation, with the intent to monetize its investment and to provide additional proceeds to the Company. The Company expects the separation to be tax-free for the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes and plans to complete the spin-off late in the third quarter of 2021, subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals. See 

Note 23

 for further discussion.

BRAZIL PACKAGING

2020:

 On October 14, 2020, the Company closed the previously announced sale of its Brazilian Industrial Packaging business for R$

330

 million ($

58.5

 million U.S. dollars), with R$

280

 million ($

49.6

 million U.S. dollars) paid at closing and R$

50

 million ($

8.9

 million U.S. dollars) to be paid one year from closing. This business includes 

three

 containerboard mills and 

four

 box plants and the agreement follows International Paper's previously announced strategic review of the Brazilian Industrial Packaging business.

In conjunction with the announced agreement, net pre-tax charges of $

347

 million ($

340

 million after taxes) were recorded in 2020. These charges included $

327

 million related to the cumulative foreign currency translation loss and a $

20

 million loss  related the write down of the long-lived assets of the Brazilian Industrial Packaging business to their estimated fair value. These charges are included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and is included in the results for the Industrial Packaging segment.

2018: 

During 2018, a determination was made that the current carrying value of the long-lived assets of the Brazil Packaging business exceeded their estimated fair value due to a change in the outlook for the business. Management engaged a third party to assist with determining the fair value of the business and the fixed assets. The fair value of the business was calculated using a probability-weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples, and transaction multiples and the fair value of the fixed assets was determined using a market approach. As a result, a pre-tax charge of $

122

 million ($

81

 million, net of tax) was recorded related to the impairment of an intangible asset and fixed assets. This charge is included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and is included in the results for the Industrial Packaging segment.

OLMUKSAN INTERNATIONAL PAPER

2020

: On January 5, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Mondi Group to sell its 

90.38

% ownership interest in Olmuksan International Paper, a corrugated packaging business in Turkey, for €

66

 million (approximately $

81

 million using the December 31, 2020 exchange rate). The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

In conjunction with the announced agreement, a determination was made that the current book value of the Olmuksan International Paper disposal group exceeded its estimated fair value of $

79

 million which was based on the agreed upon transaction price. As a result, a preliminary charge of $

123

 million  (before and after taxes) was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the cumulative foreign currency translation loss. This charge is included in the Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and is included in the results for the Industrial Packaging segment. 

At December 31, 2020, all assets and liabilities related to Olmuksan International Paper are classified as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

While we have taken into account certain impacts of COVID-19 in connection with our estimate of the allowance for expected credit losses, it is possible that additional expected credit losses in excess of such allowance could occur if additional containment and mitigation measures are required or negative economic conditions persist or deteriorate as a result of COVID-19.

20.5

% ownership interest (

79,911,511

 units) in  Graphic Packaging International Partners, LLC ("GPIP"). GPIP subsequently transferred the North American Consumer Packaging business to Graphic Packaging International, LLC ("GPI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIP that holds the assets of the combined business. On January 29, 2020, the Company exchanged 

15,150,784

 units of the aggregate units owned by the Company for an aggregated price of $

250

 million, resulting in a pre-tax 

62

Tab

le of Contents

gain of $

33

 million ($

25

 million after taxes) which was recorded in the first quarter of 2020. On August 7, 2020, the Company exchanged 

17,399,414

 units of the aggregated units owned by the Company for an aggregated price of $

250

 million, resulting in an immaterial gain which was recorded in the third quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's ownership percentage in GPIP was 

15.0

%. The Company recorded equity earnings of $

40

 million, $

46

 million and $

46

 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company received cash dividends from GPIP of $

20

 million and $

 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's investment in GPIP was $

702

 million and $

1.1

 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was $

345

 million and $

529

 million more than the Company's proportionate share of the entity's underlying net assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The difference primarily relates to the basis difference between the fair value of our investment and the underlying net assets and is generally amortized in equity earnings over a period consistent with the underlying long-lived assets.

 

The Company is party to various agreements with GPI under which it sells fiber and other products to GPI. Sales under these agreements were $

(d)

(e)

Reflects the impairment of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit.

    

The Company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test to its North America Industrial Packaging, EMEA Industrial Packaging, European Papers, Russian Papers, and Brazilian Papers reporting units as of October 1, 2020. The Company elected to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test due to the current economic environment. The quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed by comparing the carrying amount of each respective reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The Company calculated the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units with goodwill using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. The carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of any reporting units.

In addition, the Company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation. In consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to October 1, 2020.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the Company calculated the estimated fair value of the Global Cellulose Fibers reporting unit, and it was determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit, totaling $

52

 million, was impaired. This impairment charge was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019.

The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was a decrease of $(

6

) million and an increase of $

250

 million, respectively. The net change in the prior year is primarily due to tax law changes in foreign jurisdictions impacting future utilization of deferred tax assets of $

203

 million.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the captions Deferred charges and other assets and Deferred income taxes. Of the $

1.4

 billion  of deferred tax liabilities for forestlands, related installment sales, and investment in subsidiary, $

887

 million is attributable to an investment in subsidiary and relates to a 2006 International Paper installment sale of forestlands and $

If the Company were to prevail on the unrecognized tax benefits recorded, substantially all of the balances at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 would benefit the effective tax rate.

The Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The Company had approximately $

17

 million and $

21

 million accrued for the payment of estimated interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The major jurisdictions where the Company files income tax returns are the United States, Brazil, France, Poland and Russia. Generally, tax years 2007 through 2019 remain open and subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The Company frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Pending audit settlements and the expiration of statute of limitations could reduce the uncertain tax positions by $

16

 million during the next twelve months.

The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service has challenged the deductibility of goodwill amortization generated in a 2007 acquisition by International Paper do Brasil Ltda., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received assessments for the tax years 2007-2015 totaling approximately $

114

 million in tax, and $

367

 million in interest, penalties, and fees as of December 31, 2020 (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). After a previous favorable ruling challenging the basis for these assessments, we received other subsequent unfavorable decisions from the Brazilian Administrative Council of Tax Appeals. The Company has appealed and intends to further appeal these and any future unfavorable administrative judgments to the Brazilian federal courts; however, this tax litigation matter may take many years to resolve. The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transaction underlying these assessments, and has concluded based on Brazilian tax law, that its tax position would be sustained. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for tax years subsequent to 2015.

The Company provides for foreign withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. state income taxes on earnings intended to be repatriated from non-U.S. subsidiaries, which we believe will be limited in the future to each year's current earnings. No provision for these taxes on approximately $

2.3

 billion of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 has been made, as these earnings are considered indefinitely invested. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted in a taxable manner is not practicable.

If management decided to monetize the Company’s foreign investments, we would recognize the tax cost related to the excess of the book value over the tax basis of those investments. This would include foreign withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. Federal and state income taxes. Determination of the 

67

Tab

tax cost that would be incurred upon monetization of the Company’s foreign investments is not practicable; however, we do not believe it would be material.

On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act ("the CARES Act"). The CARES Act provides various types of economic relief for individuals and businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary corporate tax relief. We currently do not believe there to be a material impact to the income tax provision resulting from the CARES Act.

OTE 14 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

GUARANTEES

In connection with sales of businesses, property, equipment, forestlands and other assets, International Paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets, and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities, breaches of representations and warranties, and other matters. Where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable, accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Environmental 

International Paper has been named as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"). Many of these proceedings involve the 

cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA and equivalent state laws, as a practical matter, liability for CERCLA cleanups is typically allocated among the many PRPs. There are other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the Company’s current, closed or formerly-owned facilities, and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet.

Remediation costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable. International Paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these environmental remediation matters, including those described herein, to be approximately $

185

 million ($

194

 million undiscounted) in the aggregate as of December 31, 2020. Other than as described below, completion of required environmental remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Cass Lake:

 One of the matters included above arises out of a closed wood-treatment facility located in Cass Lake, Minnesota. In June 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of $

45

 million as of December 31, 2020. In April 2020, the EPA issued a final plan concerning clean-up standards at a portion of the site, the estimated cost of which is included within the reserve referenced above. In October 2012, the Natural Resource Trustees for this site provided notice to International Paper and other PRPs of their intent to perform a Natural Resource Damage Assessment. It is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of the applicable reserve referenced above, which may be incurred.

Kalamazoo River: 

The Company is a PRP with respect to the Allied Paper, Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site in Michigan. The EPA asserts that the site is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") primarily as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the Kalamazoo River, including a paper mill (the "Allied Paper Mill") formerly owned by St. Regis Paper Company ("St. Regis"). The Company is a successor in interest to St. Regis. 

•

Operable Unit 5, Area 1: In March 2016, the Company and other PRPs received a special notice letter from the EPA (i) inviting participation in implementing a remedy for a portion of the site known as Operable Unit 5, Area 1, and (ii) demanding reimbursement of EPA past costs totaling $

37

 million, including $

19

 million in past costs previously demanded by the EPA. The Company responded to the special notice letter. In December 2016, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to the Company and other 

68

Tab

le of Contents

PRPs to perform the remedy. The Company responded to the unilateral administrative order, agreeing to comply with the order subject to its sufficient cause defenses.

•

Operable Unit 5, Area 2:  In September 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting the final remedy for a portion of the site known as Operable Unit 5, Area 2, but has not yet issued a special notice letter for implementing the remedy.

•

Operable Unit 1: In October 2016, the Company and another PRP received a special notice letter from the EPA inviting participation in the remedial design component of the landfill remedy for the Allied Paper Mill, which is also known as Operable Unit 1. The Record of Decision establishing the final landfill remedy for the Allied Paper Mill was issued by the EPA in September 2016. The Company responded to the Allied Paper Mill special notice letter in December 2016. In February 2017, the EPA informed the Company that it would make other arrangements for the performance of the remedial design.

In addition, in December 2019, the United States published notice in the Federal Register of a proposed consent decree with NCR Corporation (one of the parties to the allocation/apportionment litigation described below), the State of Michigan and natural resource trustees under which NCR would make payments of more than  $

100

 million and perform work at the Site at an estimated cost of $

135.7

 million. On December 2, 2020, the Federal District Court approved the proposed consent decree, as submitted. NCR will deposit the settlement funds into a Court Registry Account. 

The Company’s CERCLA liability has not been finally determined with respect to these or any other portions of the site, and except as noted above, the Company has declined to perform any work or reimburse the EPA at this time. As noted below, the Company is involved in allocation/apportionment litigation with regard to the site. Accordingly, it is premature to predict the outcome or estimate our maximum reasonably possible loss or range of loss with respect to this site. We have recorded a liability for future remediation costs at the site that are probable and reasonably estimable, and it remains reasonably possible that additional losses in excess of this recorded liability could be material.

The Company was named as a defendant by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation and Georgia Pacific LLC in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the site. NCR Corporation and Weyerhaeuser Company are also named as defendants in the suit. The suit seeks contribution under CERCLA for costs purportedly expended by plaintiffs ($

79

 million as of the filing of the complaint) and for future remediation 

costs. In June 2018, the Court issued its Final Judgment and Order, which fixed the past cost amount at approximately $

50

 million (plus interest to be determined) and allocated to the Company a 

15

% share of responsibility for those past costs. The Court did not address responsibility for future costs in its decision. In July 2018, the Company and each of the other parties filed notices appealing the Final Judgment and prior orders incorporated into that Judgment. The proposed consent decree by NCR described above will result in the termination of NCR's involvement in the appeal.

Harris County: 

International Paper and McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corporation ("MIMC"), a subsidiary of Waste Management, Inc. ("WMI"), are PRPs at the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site in Harris County, Texas. The PRPs have been actively participating in the activities at the site and share the costs of these activities. 

In October 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision ("ROD") selecting the final remedy for the site: removal and relocation of the waste material from both the northern and southern impoundments. The EPA did not specify the methods or practices needed to perform this work. The EPA’s selected remedy was accompanied by a cost estimate of approximately  $

115

 million ($

105

 million for the northern impoundment, and $

10

 million for the southern impoundment). Subsequent to the issuance of the ROD, there have been numerous meetings between the EPA and the PRPs, and the Company continues to work with the EPA and MIMC/WMI to develop the remedial design. 

To this end, in April 2018, the PRPs entered into an Administrative Order on Consent ("AOC") with the EPA, agreeing to work together to develop the remedial design until April 2021. The AOC does not include any agreement to perform waste removal or other construction activity at the site. Rather, it involves adaptive management techniques and a pre-design investigation, the objectives of which include filling data gaps (including but not limited to post-Hurricane Harvey technical data generated prior to the ROD and not incorporated into the selected remedy), refining areas and volumes of materials to be addressed, determining if an excavation remedy is able to be implemented in a manner protective of human health and the environment, and investigating potential impacts of remediation activities to infrastructure in the vicinity. 

During the first quarter of 2020, through a series of meetings among the Company, MIMC/WMI, our consultants, the EPA and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"), progress was made to resolve key technical issues previously preventing the Company from determining the manner in which the selected remedy for the northern impoundment would be feasibly implemented. As a result of these developments the Company reserved the following amounts in relation to remediation at this site:  (a) $

10

 million for the southern impoundment; and (b) $

55

 million for the northern impoundment, which 

69

Tab

le of Contents

represents the Company's 

50

% share of our estimate of the low end of the range of probable remediation costs.

Although key technical issues have been resolved, we still face significant challenges remediating the northern impoundment in a cost-efficient manner and without a release to the environment and therefore our discussions with the EPA on the best approach to remediation will continue. Because of ongoing questions regarding cost effectiveness, timing and gathering other technical data, additional losses in excess of our recorded liability are possible. We are currently unable to reasonably estimate any further adjustment to our recorded liability or any loss or range of loss in excess of such liability; however, we believe it is unlikely any adjustment would be material.

Asbestos-Related Matters

We have been named as a defendant in various asbestos-related personal injury litigation, in both state and federal court, primarily in relation to the prior operations of certain companies previously acquired by the Company. The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its asbestos liabilities and reviews recent and historical claims data. During the second quarter of 2020, as previously disclosed, we adjusted our estimated net liability associated with asbestos-related litigation concerning products sold by Champion International Corporation prior to our acquisition of Champion in 2000 to revise the time period associated with anticipated future claims through 2059, a commonly viewed end point when such claims are more predictable. We concluded the adjustment of $

43

 million to increase this net liability, which resulted in a liability of $

75

 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries, was not material to any period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total recorded liability with respect to pending and future asbestos-related claims was $

115

 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries. While it is reasonably possible that the Company may incur losses in excess of its recorded liability with respect to asbestos-related matters, we do not believe material losses are probable.

Antitrust

Italy: 

In March 2017, the Italian Competition Authority ("ICA") commenced an investigation into the Italian packaging industry to determine whether producers of corrugated sheets and boxes violated the applicable European competition law. In April 2019, the ICA concluded its investigation and issued initial findings alleging that over 

30

 producers, including our Italian packaging subsidiary ("IP Italy"), improperly coordinated the production and sale of corrugated sheets and boxes. On August 6, 2019, the ICA issued its decision and assessed IP Italy a fine of €

29

 million (approximately $

32

 million at current exchange rates) which was recorded in the third quarter of 2019. 

However, we are vigorously appealing this decision of the ICA to the Italian courts and have numerous and strong bases for our appeal.

Taxes Other Than Payroll and Income Taxes

In 2017, the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court decided that the state value-added tax ("VAT") should not be included in the basis of federal VAT calculations. In 2018 and 2019, the Brazilian tax authorities published both an internal consultation and a normative ruling with a narrow interpretation of the effects of the case. We have determined that any related federal VAT refunds should be recognized when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Based upon the best information available to us, we have determined that the amount of refund that is probable of being realized is limited to that determined by the tax authorities' narrow interpretation, for which we have recognized a receivable of $

12

 million as of December 31, 2020. It is possible that future court decisions and guidance from the tax authorities could expand the scope of the federal VAT refunds. 

General

The Company is involved in various other inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters, personal injury, product liability, labor and employment, contracts, sales of property, intellectual property, tax, and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. See 

Note 13

 for details regarding a tax matter. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions, and are otherwise subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, there can be no certainty that the Company will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. The Company believes that loss contingencies arising from pending matters including the matters described herein, will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in pending or threatened legal matters, some of which are beyond the Company's control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, a future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals with respect to these matters could result in future charges that could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.

NOTE 15 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

 

In connection with the 2006 sale of approximately 

5.6

 million acres of forestlands, International Paper received installment notes (the "Timber Notes") totaling approximately $

4.8

 billion. The Timber Notes were used as collateral for borrowings from third party lenders, which effectively monetized the Timber 

70

Tab

le of Contents

Notes through the creation of newly formed special purposes entities (the "Entities"). The monetization structure preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sales. As of December 31, 2020, this deferred tax liability was $

887

 million. 

During 2015, International Paper initiated a series of actions in order to extend the 2006 monetization structure and maintain the long-term nature of the deferred tax liability. The Entities, with assets and liabilities primarily consisting of the Timber Notes and third-party bank loans (the "Extension Loans"), were restructured which resulted in the formation of wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (the "2015 Financing Entities").

The Timber Notes are shown in Current financial assets of variable interest entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in August 2021. These notes, which do not require principal payments prior to their maturity, are supported by approximately $

4.8

 billion of irrevocable letters of credit. 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Extension Loans were amended to extend the maturity dates to August 2021. The Extension Loans are shown in Current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. These bank loans, totaling approximately $

4.2

 billion, are nonrecourse to the Company, and are secured by approximately $

4.8

 billion of Timber Notes, the irrevocable letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes, and approximately $

150

 million of International Paper debt obligations. The $

150

 million of International Paper debt obligations are eliminated in the consolidation of the 2015 Financing Entities and are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Provisions of loan agreements related to approximately $

1.1

 billion of the Extension Loans require the bank issuing letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes pledged as collateral to maintain a credit rating at or above a specified threshold. In the event the credit rating of the letter of credit bank is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit must be replaced within 

60 days

 with letters of credit from a qualifying financial institution. 

As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the Timber Notes was $

4.9

 billion, and the fair value of the Extension Loans  was $

4.2

 billion and $

4.3

 billion for the years ended 2020 and 2019. The Timber Notes and Extension Loans are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in

In connection with the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012, two special purpose entities became wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Paper. The use of the two wholly-owned special purpose entities discussed below preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2007 Temple-Inland timberlands sales. As of December 31, 2020, this deferred tax liability was $

488

 million, which will be settled with the maturity of the notes in 2027.

In October 2007, Temple-Inland sold 

1.55

 million acres of timberland for $

2.4

 billion. The total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in 2027 issued by the buyer of the timberland, which Temple-Inland contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The notes are shown in Long-term financial assets of variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are supported by $

2.4

 billion of irrevocable letters of credit issued by three banks, which are required to maintain minimum credit ratings on their long-term debt. 

In December 2007, Temple-Inland's two wholly-owned special purpose entities borrowed $

2.1

 billion which is shown in Long-term nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities. The loans are repayable in 2027 and are secured by the $

2.4

 billion of notes and the irrevocable letters of credit securing the notes, and are nonrecourse to us. The loan agreements provide that if a credit rating of any of the banks issuing the letters of credit is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within 

30 days

 with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution. 

As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the notes receivable was $

2.3

 billion. As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of this debt was $

% due in 2021, $

658

 million with an interest rate of

297

 million with an interest rate of

$

152

 million in open market repurchases related to debt with interest rates ranging from 

3.00

% to 

4.40

% and maturities dates from 2026 to 2048. 

The Company had debt issuances in 2020 of $

583

 million related primarily to the AR securitization program and international debt. In addition to the early debt reductions, the Company had debt reductions of $

638

 million in 2020 related primarily to the AR securitization program, commercial paper, and international debt.

The borrowing capacity of the Company's commercial paper program is $

1.0

 billion. Under the terms of this program, individual maturities on borrowings may vary, but not exceed one year from the date of issue. Interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes. The Company had 

no

 borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and $

30

 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019, under this program.

In March 2020, the Company entered into a $

750

 million contractually committed 364-day revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions which augments the Company's access to liquidity due to macroeconomic conditions at that time and supplements the Company's $

1.5

 billion five-year credit agreement. In October 2020, the Company extended the expiration date of the $

1.5

 billion credit agreement from December 2021 to December 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under either the $

750

 million revolving credit agreement or the $

1.5

 billion credit agreement.

In April 2020, the Company's receivable securitization program was amended from an uncommitted financing arrangement to a committed financing arrangement with a borrowing limit up to $

550

 million based on eligible receivables balances that expires in April 2022. This was done in response to the economic environment related to COVID-19 to further strengthen the Company’s liquidity position. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 

no

 borrowings outstanding under the program. After considering the Company’s liquidity position in relation to COVID-19 and the current economic environment, the Company's receivable securitization program was amended from a committed financing arrangement to an uncommitted financing arrangement in February 2021 with the borrowing limit and expiration date remaining unchanged.

The calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and both the current and long-term Nonrecourse Financial Liabilities of Variable Interest Entities. The total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

 

NOTE 17 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

International Paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks. International Paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria at inception, International Paper formally designates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge of a specific underlying exposure.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.

Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion for both cash flow and fair value hedges, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

We manufacture and sell our products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the 

73

Tab

le of Contents

world and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.

To manage this exchange rate risk, we have historically utilized a combination of forward contracts, options and currency swaps. Contracts that qualify are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies or net investment hedges of foreign denominated subsidiaries. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges, all changes in the  fair value of these instruments are recorded in AOCI, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in AOCI. 

The change in value of certain non-qualifying instruments used to manage foreign exchange exposure of intercompany financing transactions and certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.

COMMODITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility in earnings due to price fluctuations, we may utilize swap contracts or forward purchase contracts. 

Derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values, unless the derivative instruments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale ("NPNS") exception under GAAP and such exception has been elected.  If the NPNS exception is elected, the fair values of such contracts are not recognized on the balance sheet.

Contracts that qualify are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective and non-qualifying portions, which are not material for any year presented, are immediately recognized in earnings. The change in the fair value of certain non-qualifying instruments used to reduce commodity price volatility is immediately recognized in earnings.

The notional amounts of qualifying and non-qualifying instruments used in hedging transactions were as follows:

During the first quarter of 2020, International Paper terminated its interest rate contracts in fair value hedging relationships. These contracts had a notional value of $

700

 million and an approximate fair value of $

85

 million at the time of termination. Subsequent to the termination of the interest rate swaps, the fair value basis adjustment is amortized to earnings as interest income over the same period as a debt premium on the previously hedged debt. During the first and second quarter of 2020, International Paper also terminated interest rate contracts in net investment hedging relationships with a notional value of $

475

 million. These contracts had an approximate fair value of $

33

 million at the time of termination. 

Subsequent to the termination of the net investment hedges, the fair value is accounted for in other comprehensive income as cumulative translation adjustment for the previously hedged net investment.

Fair Value Measurements

International Paper’s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value consist of derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, options and other financial instruments that are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and currency risks.  For these financial instruments, fair value is determined at each balance sheet date using an income approach.

The guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy that groups fair value measurement inputs into the following three classifications:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.

Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. All of International Paper’s derivative fair value measurements use Level 2 inputs.

Below is a description of the valuation calculation and the inputs used for each class of contract:

Interest Rate Contracts

Interest rate contracts are valued using swap curves obtained from an independent market data provider. 

The market value of each contract is the sum of the fair value of all future interest payments between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. 

The fair value of the future interest payments is determined by comparing the contract rate to the derived forward interest rate and present valued using the appropriate derived interest rate curve.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Foreign currency forward and option contracts are valued using standard valuation models. Significant inputs used in these standard valuation models are foreign currency forward and interest rate curves  and a volatility measurement.  The fair value of each contract is present valued using the applicable interest rate. All significant inputs are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions.

Electricity Contract

The Company is party to an electricity contract used to manage market fluctuations in energy pricing. The Company's electricity contract is valued using the Mid-C index forward curve obtained from the Intercontinental Exchange. The market value of the 

contract is the sum of the fair value of all future purchase payments between the contract counterparties, discounted to present value. The fair value of the future purchase payments is determined by comparing the contract price to the forward price and present valued using International Paper's cost of capital.

Since the volume and level of activity of the markets that each of the above contracts are traded in has been normal, the fair value calculations have not been adjusted for inactive markets or disorderly transactions.

The above contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that provide rights of offset with each counterparty when amounts are payable on the same date in the same currency or in the case of certain specified defaults. Management has made an accounting policy election to not offset the fair value of recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  The amounts owed to the counterparties and owed to the Company are considered immaterial with respect to each counterparty and in the aggregate with all counterparties.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

International Paper evaluates credit risk by monitoring its exposure with each counterparty to ensure that exposure stays within acceptable policy limits. Credit risk is also mitigated by contractual provisions with the majority of our banks. Certain of the contracts include a credit support annex that requires the posting of collateral by the counterparty or International Paper based on each party’s rating and level of exposure. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the collateral threshold is generally $

15

 million.

If the lower of the Company’s credit rating by Moody’s or S&P were to drop below investment grade, the Company would be required to post collateral for all of its derivatives in a net liability position, although no derivatives would terminate. The fair value of derivative instruments containing credit-risk-related contingent features in a net  liability position was $

5

 million and $

1

 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.  The Company was  not required to post any collateral as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.

NOTE 19 RETIREMENT PLANS

International Paper sponsors and maintains the Retirement Plan of International Paper Company (the "Pension Plan"), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides retirement benefits to certain employees. 

The Pension Plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings (salaried employees and hourly employees receiving salaried benefits), hourly job rates or specified benefit rates (hourly and union employees).  

The Company also has 

two

 unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plans: a Pension Restoration Plan that provides retirement benefits based on eligible compensation in excess of limits set by the Internal Revenue Service, and a supplemental retirement plan for senior managers ("SERP"), which is an alternative retirement plan for salaried employees who are senior vice presidents and above or who are designated by the chief executive officer as participants. These nonqualified plans are only funded to the extent of benefits paid, which totaled $

31

 million, $

26

 million and $

29

 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and which are expected to be $

21

 million in 2021.

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company froze participation, including credited service and compensation, for salaried employees under the Pension Plan, the Pension Restoration Plan and the  SERP plan. This change does not affect benefits accrued through December 31, 2018. For service after December 31, 2018, employees affected by the freeze receive a company contribution to their individual  Retirement Savings Account as described later in this 

Note 19

.

Many non-U.S. employees are covered by various retirement benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes.

The non-current portion of the liability is included with the pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under Pension Benefit Obligation. The liability for Turkey has been reclassified to Liabilities held for sale. 

The largest contributor to the actuarial loss affecting the benefit obligation was the decrease in the discount rate from

% at December 31, 2019 to  

2.60

% at December 31, 2020. However positive asset returns offset the higher obligation for an improved funded position.

ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits” provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets and other assumption changes. These net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains in subsequent years. 

NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE

Service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans’ benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year. Interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation, which is a discounted amount, due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current-year earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated long-term rate of return.

The components of net periodic pension expense other than the Service cost component are included in Non-operating pension expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The decrease in 2020 pension expense primarily reflects higher asset returns and lower interest cost slightly offset by higher service cost.

On September 25, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately $

1.6

 billion of International Paper's U.S. qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction closed on October 2, 2018 and was funded with pension plan assets. Under the transaction, at the end of 2018, Prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 

23,000

 retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than $

1,000

 in monthly benefit payments from the plan. Settlement accounting rules required a remeasurement of the qualified plan as of October 2, 2018 and the Company recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of $

424

 million before tax in the fourth quarter of 2018.

ASSUMPTIONS

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements for employers’ accounting for pensions. These assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of December 31 of the current year and pension expense to be recorded in the following year (i.e., the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 is also the discount rate used to determine net pension expense for the 2021 year).

Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for our defined benefit plans are presented in the following table:

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan’s investment portfolio. Projected rates of return are developed through an asset/liability study in which projected returns for each of the plan’s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes. 

Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets. The discount rate assumption was determined from a universe of high quality corporate bonds. A settlement portfolio is selected and matched to the present value of the plan’s projected benefit

payments. To calculate pension expense for 2021, the Company will use an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 

6.60

% for the Retirement Plan of International Paper, a discount rate of 

2.60

% and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 

2.25

%. The Company estimates that it will record net pension income of approximately $

114

 million for its U.S. defined benefit plans in 2021, compared to expense of $

32

 million in 2020. The estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2020 is primarily due to higher return on assets and lower interest cost partially offset by higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service cost.

For non-U.S. pension plans, assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country.

The following illustrates the effect on pension expense for 2021 of a

PLAN ASSETS

International Paper’s Board of Directors has appointed a Fiduciary Review Committee that is responsible for fiduciary oversight of the U.S. Pension Plan, approving investment policy and reviewing the management and control of plan assets. Pension Plan assets are invested to maximize returns within prudent levels of risk. 

The Pension Plan maintains a strategic asset allocation policy that designates target allocations by asset class. Investments are diversified across classes and within each class to minimize the risk of large losses. Derivatives, including swaps, forward and futures contracts, may be used as asset class substitutes or for hedging or other risk management purposes. Periodic reviews are made of investment 

policy objectives and investment manager performance. For non-U.S. plans, assets consist principally of common stock and fixed income securities.

International Paper’s U.S. pension allocations by type of fund at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and target allocations were as follows:

(a) A private equity fund investment ("partnership interest") is contractually locked up for the life of the private equity fund by the partnership agreement. Limited partners do not have the option to redeem partnership interests.

 

Equity securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. companies and international companies. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. 

Fixed income consists of government securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, 

common collective funds and other fixed income investments. Government securities are valued by third-party pricing sources. Mortgage-backed security holdings consist primarily of agency-rated holdings. The fair value estimates for mortgage securities are calculated by third-party pricing sources chosen by the custodian’s price matrix. Corporate bonds are valued using either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or using a discounted cash flows approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. Common collective funds are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date. Other fixed income investments of $(

1,585

) million and $(

647

) million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily include reverse repurchase agreement obligations in which we have sold a security and have an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same security at a later date for a price specified in the agreement.

Derivative investments such as futures, forward contracts, options and swaps are used to help manage risks. Derivatives are generally employed as asset class substitutes (such as when employed in a portable alpha strategy), for managing asset/liability mismatches, or bona fide hedging or other appropriate risk management purposes.

 

 Derivative instruments are generally valued by the investment managers or in certain instances by third-party pricing sources.

Hedge funds are investment structures for managing private, loosely-regulated investment pools that can pursue a diverse array of investment strategies with a

wide range of different securities and derivative instruments. These investments are made through funds-of-funds (commingled, multi-manager fund structures) and through direct investments in individual hedge funds. Hedge funds are primarily valued by each fund’s third-party administrator based upon the valuation of the underlying securities and instruments and primarily by applying a market or income valuation methodology as appropriate depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. Funds-of-funds are valued based upon the net asset values of the underlying investments in hedge funds.

Private equity consists of interests in partnerships that invest in U.S. and non-U.S. debt and equity securities. Partnership interests are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interest cash flows.

Real estate funds include commercial properties, land and timberland, and generally include, but are not limited to, retail, office, industrial, multifamily and hotel properties. Real estate fund values are primarily reported by the fund manager and are based on 

valuation of the underlying investments which include inputs such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.

FUNDING AND CASH FLOWS

The Company’s funding policy for the Pension Plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, cash flow generated by the Company, and other factors. The Company continually reassesses the amount and  timing of any discretionary contributions. No voluntary contributions were made in 2018, 2019 or 2020. Generally, International Paper’s non-U.S. pension plans are funded using the projected benefit as a target, except in certain countries where funding of benefit plans is not required.

At December 31, 2020, projected future pension benefit payments, excluding any termination benefits, were as follows:

OTHER U.S. PLANS

International Paper sponsors the International Paper Company Salaried Savings Plan and the International Paper Company Hourly Savings Plan, both of which are tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) savings plans. Substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees are eligible to participate and may make elective deferrals to such plans to save for retirement. International Paper makes matching contributions to participant accounts on a specified percentage of employee deferrals as determined by the provisions of each plan. The Company makes Retirement Savings Account contributions equal to a percentage of an eligible employee’s pay. Beginning in 2019, as a result of the freeze for salaried employees under the Pension Plan,  all salaried employees are eligible for the contribution to the Retirement Savings Account.

The Company also sponsors the International Paper Company Deferred Compensation Savings Plan, which is an unfunded nonqualified defined contribution plan. This plan permits eligible employees to continue to make deferrals and receive company matching contributions (and Retirement Savings Account contributions) when their contributions to the International Paper Salaried

Savings Plan are stopped due to limitations under U.S. tax law. Participant deferrals and company contributions are not invested in a separate trust, but are paid directly from International Paper’s general assets at the time benefits become due and payable.

Company contributions to the plans totaled approximately $

154

 million, $

172

 million and $

125

 million for the plan years ending in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 

NOTE 20 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

International Paper provides certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits covering certain U.S. salaried and hourly employees. These employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of creditable service. International Paper does not fund these benefits prior to payment and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future.

In addition to the U.S. plan, certain Brazilian and Moroccan employees are eligible for retiree health care and life insurance benefits.

NOTE 21 INCENTIVE PLANS

International Paper currently has an Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP). The ICP authorizes grants of restricted stock, restricted or deferred stock units, performance awards payable in cash or stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals,

dividend equivalents, stock options, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards at the discretion of the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") that administers the ICP.   Additionally, restricted stock, which may be deferred into RSU’s, may be awarded under a Restricted Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN

Under the Performance Share Plan ("PSP"), contingent awards of International Paper common stock are granted by the Committee. The PSP awards are earned over a three-year period. PSP awards are earned based on the achievement of defined performance of Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") measured against our internal benchmark and ranking of Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") compared to the TSR peer group of companies. The 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 Awards are weighted 

50

% ROIC and 

50

% TSR for all participants. The ROIC component of the PSP awards is valued at the closing stock price on the day prior to the grant date. As the ROIC component contains a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. The TSR component of the PSP awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as the TSR component contains a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the TSR component based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free rate, expected dividends, and the expected volatility for the Company and its competitors. The expected term is estimated based on the vesting period of the awards, the risk-free rate is based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period, and the volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility over the expected term. PSP grants are made in performance-based restricted stock units. 

The following table sets forth the assumptions used to determine compensation cost for the market condition component of the PSP plan:

NOTE 22 FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA

International Paper’s business segments, Industrial Packaging, Global Cellulose Fibers and Printing Papers, are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. See the 

Description of Business Segments

 on pages 26 and 27 in 

Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

 for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.

Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense.

External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

NOTE 23 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

SALE OF KWIDZYN MILL

On February 12, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell our Kwidzyn, Poland mill for €

670

 million (approximately $

812

 million) in cash, subject to final working capital and net debt adjustments.  The business includes the pulp and paper mill in Kwidzyn and supporting functions. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.   

On December 3, 2020, the Company announced its intention to spin off its Printing Papers business into a standalone, publicly-traded company in order to focus on its corrugated packaging and absorbent fibers businesses. The sale of Kwidzyn provides an opportunity for International Paper to achieve a premium value and significant incremental cash proceeds, but otherwise does not change its plans for the proposed spin-off.

GRAPHIC PACKAGING MONETIZATION

On February 16,  2021, the Company exchanged 

15,307,000

 units of the aggregate units owned by the Company for 

15,307,000

 shares of Graphic Packaging stock. The Company sold the shares in open market transactions for approximately $

247

 million. Additionally, on February 16, 2021, Graphic Packaging repurchased 

9,281,316

 units owned by the Company for an aggregate price of $

150

 million. The Company expects to recognize a gain on these two transactions and related tax expense in the first quarter 2021.
