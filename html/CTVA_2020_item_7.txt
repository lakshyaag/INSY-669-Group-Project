ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, 

continued 

waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 2 new sites during 2018. There were no new notices in 2019 or 2020.

Environmental Capital Expenditures 

Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $11 million in 2021.

Climate Change

The company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors maintains oversight of these risks and opportunities. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. Across its business, individuals who are responsible for climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives. 

Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.  

Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on customers’ ability to use the company's products, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its overall risk management.

The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company's businesses, strategy and financial planning and are presented in the 14 ten-year sustainability goals that were set in 2020. For each goal, the company established key performance indicators and criteria to achieve the goals, which are provided on the company's website at: https://www.corteva.com/sustainability.html. The information contained on the company’s website is not part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the company’s other SEC filings.

As demonstrated by the goals, Corteva is working to shrink its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses while enabling a more resilient agriculture value chain. Corteva will establish a climate strategy, including appropriate Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas reduction targets, by June 2021. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability.  

The company is committed to engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe who have innovative and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people.  By doing more to address climate change today, the company is fortifying its ability to grow food, grow progress and build a sustainable industry that will help humanity thrive for generations to come.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates.  The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results.  In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls.  For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts may be used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks 

The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings.  The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the Brazilian Real, Swiss franc, European Euro ("EUR"), and Canadian dollar.  The company uses foreign exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain forecasted transactions, investment in foreign subsidiaries, as well as the translation of foreign currency-denominated earnings and uses commodity contracts to offset risks associated with foreign currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar ("USD") amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. 

Certain foreign entities of the company held USD denominated marketable securities, mainly U.S. government securities, at December 31, 2020. The USD/EUR was the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities. These marketable securities were classified as available-for-sale and as such, fluctuations in foreign exchange were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) within the Consolidated Statements of Equity. These fluctuations are subsequently reclassified from AOCL to earnings in the period in which the marketable securities are sold.

The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates.

Since the company's risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.

Concentration of Credit Risk 

The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.

As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service Corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.

The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.
