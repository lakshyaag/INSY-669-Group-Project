>Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW 

The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report.

We are one of the largest global apparel companies in the world and, in March 2020, we marked our 100-year anniversary as a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange. We manage a diversified brand portfolio, including 

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

 CALVIN KLEIN

, 

Van Heusen

, 

IZOD

, 

ARROW

, 

Speedo

 (licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean), 

Warner’s

,

 Olga

,

 True&Co. 

and 

Geoffrey Beene

. Our brand portfolio also consists of various other owned, licensed and, to a lesser extent, private label brands. We entered into a definitive agreement on January 9, 2020 to sell our Speedo North America business to Pentland and, upon closing of the sale, we will no longer license the 

Speedo

 trademark. The Speedo transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. The closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which has been received.

    

Our business strategy is to position our brands to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license the use of our trademarks to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees’ expertise can better serve our brands.

Our revenue was $9.9 billion in 2019, of which over 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global lifestyle brands, 

TOMMY HILFIGER 

and

 CALVIN KLEIN

, together generated approximately 85% of our revenue. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COVID-19 Outbreak

The COVID-19 outbreak is having a significant impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in 2020. 

Virus-related concerns, reduced travel, temporary store closures and government-imposed restrictions have resulted in sharply reduced traffic and consumer spending trends and sales stoppages in our retail stores and in the stores of our wholesale customers in virtually all key markets during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, our supply chain had been disrupted and may experience future disruptions as a result of either closed factories or factories with reduced workforces. Our licensees’ sales and their supply chain are also being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which in turn negatively impacts our royalty revenue. 

There is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak; however, there will be a significant negative impact to our 2020 revenue and net income. 

Further, our fourth quarter of 2019 earnings were negatively impacted compared to the prior year period by $22 million of additional inventory reserves that we recorded in anticipation of the lower sales trends projected in 2020 as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak.  

Operations Overview   

We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear (casual apparel), jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swimwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products under owned and licensed trademarks, including through digital commerce sites operated by our wholesale partners and pure play digital commerce retailers, and (ii) the sale of certain of these products through (a) approximately 1,830 Company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our 

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

 CALVIN KLEIN 

and certain of our heritage brands trademarks, (b) approximately 1,500 Company-operated shop-in-shop/concession locations worldwide under our 

TOMMY HILFIGER 

and 

CALVIN KLEIN 

trademarks, and (c) digital commerce sites in over 30 countries under our 

TOMMY HILFIGER

 and 

CALVIN KLEIN

 trademarks and in the United States through our directly operated digital commerce sites for 

Speedo

, 

True&Co

., 

Van Heusen

, and 

IZOD

, as well as our 

 32

styleBureau

.com site. Additionally, we generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. We manage our operations through our operating divisions, which are presented as 

six

 reportable segments: (i) Tommy Hilfiger North America; (ii) Tommy Hilfiger International; (iii) Calvin Klein North America; (iv) Calvin Klein International; (v) Heritage Brands Wholesale; and (vi) Heritage Brands Retail. 

        

We have entered into the following transactions that have impacted our results of operations and the comparability among the years, including our 2020 expectations as compared to 2019, as discussed below:

•

We entered into a definitive agreement on January 9, 2020 to sell our Speedo North America business to Pentland for $170 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, as described above. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Speedo transaction and expected deconsolidation of the net assets of the business, consisting of (i) a noncash impairment of our perpetual license right for the 

Speedo

 trademark and (ii) a noncash loss to reduce the carrying value of the business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. 

•

We entered into agreements on July 3, 2019 to terminate early the licenses for the global Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger North America socks and hosiery businesses in order to consolidate the socks and hosiery businesses for all of our brands in the United States and Canada in a newly formed joint venture, PVH Legwear, in which we own a 49% economic interest, and to bring in-house the international Calvin Klein socks and hosiery wholesale businesses. PVH Legwear was formed with a wholly owned subsidiary of our former Heritage Brands socks and hosiery licensee, and licenses from us the rights to distribute and sell 

TOMMY HILFIGER

, 

CALVIN KLEIN

, 

IZOD

, 

Van Heusen

 and 

Warner’s

 socks and hosiery beginning in December 2019. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $60 million during 2019 in connection with these agreements.

•

We completed the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions in the second quarter of 2019. The Australia acquisition closed on May 31, 2019. Prior to the closing, we, along with Gazal, jointly owned and managed a joint venture, PVH Australia, which licensed and operated businesses under the 

TOMMY HILFIGER

, 

CALVIN KLEIN

 and 

Van Heusen

 brands, along with other owned and licensed brands. PVH Australia came under our full control as a result of the Australia acquisition and we now operate directly those businesses. The aggregate net purchase price for the shares acquired was $59 million, net of cash acquired and after taking into account the proceeds from the divestiture to a third party of an office building and warehouse owned by Gazal in June 2019. We completed the TH CSAP acquisition on July 1, 2019 for $74 million, as a result of which we now operate directly the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in the Central and Southeast Asia market. Please see Note 3, “Acquisitions,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

In connection with the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions, we recorded an aggregate net pre-tax gain of $83 million during 2019, including (i) a noncash gain of $113 million to write up our existing equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value, partially offset by (ii) $21 million of pre-tax costs, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and one-time expenses recorded on our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia prior to the Australia acquisition closing, and (iii) a $9 million expense recorded in interest expense, net resulting from the remeasurement of our mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest that was recognized in connection with the Australia acquisition. 

•

We entered into a licensing agreement on May 30, 2019 with G-III for the design, production and wholesale distribution of 

CALVIN KLEIN JEANS

 women’s jeanswear collections in the United States and Canada, which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated Calvin Klein North America women’s jeanswear wholesale business in 2019.

•

We refinanced on April 29, 2019 our senior credit facilities and recorded pre-tax debt modification and extinguishment charges of $5 million. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

•

We closed our 

TOMMY HILFIGER 

flagship and anchor stores in the United States (the “TH U.S. store closures”)

 

in the first quarter of 2019

 and recorded pre-tax costs of $55 million, primarily consisting of noncash lease asset impairments. Please see Note 12, “Fair Value Measurements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the noncash lease asset impairments.

•

We announced on January 10, 2019 a restructuring in connection with strategic changes for our

 

Calvin Klein business (the “Calvin Klein restructuring”). The strategic changes included (i) the closure of the 

CALVIN KLEIN 205 W39 NYC 

brand (formerly 

Calvin Klein Collection

), (ii) the closure of the flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New 

 33

York 

(collectively with (i), the “CK Collection closure”)

, (iii) the restructuring of the Calvin Klein creative and design teams globally, and (iv) the consolidation of operations for the men’s Calvin Klein Sportswear and Calvin Klein Jeans businesses. All costs related to this restructuring were incurred by the end of 2019. 

We recorded pre-tax costs of $103 million during 2019 in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, consisting of a $30 million noncash lease asset impairment resulting from the closure of the flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York, $26 million of contract termination and other costs, $26 million of severance, $9 million of other noncash asset impairments and $13 million of inventory markdowns

. We recorded pre-tax costs of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, consisting of $27 million of severance, $7 million of noncash asset impairments, $4 million of contract termination and other costs and $2 million of inventory markdowns. Please see 

Note 18

, “

Exit Activity Costs

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. 

•

We acquired on April 20, 2018 the 

Geoffrey Beene

 tradename from Geoffrey Beene for $17 million, of which $16 million was paid in cash. Prior to the acquisition, we had licensed the rights to design, market and distribute 

Geoffrey Beene

 dress shirts and neckwear from Geoffrey Beene.

•

We issued on December 21, 2017 €600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027. We redeemed on January 5, 2018 our $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022 (using the proceeds of the senior notes due December 15, 2027) and recorded pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of $24 million. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

•

We amended on December 20, 2017 Mr. Tommy Hilfiger’s employment agreement, pursuant to which we made a cash buyout of a portion of the future payment obligation (the “Mr. Hilfiger amendment”). We recorded pre-tax charges of $83 million in 2017 in connection with the amendment.

•

We restructured our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung Trading Limited (“Li & Fung”) in a transaction that closed on September 30, 2017. Our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung was terminated in connection with this transaction (the “Li & Fung termination”). We recorded pre-tax charges of $54 million in 2017 in connection with the termination.

•

We acquired on September 1, 2017 the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein wholesale and concessions businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg from a former agent (the “Belgian acquisition”) for $12 million. As a result of this acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses in this region. 

•

We acquired on March 30, 2017 True & Co., a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel digital-centric retailer, for $28 million, net of $400,000 of cash acquired. This acquisition enabled us to participate further in the fast-growing online channel and provided a platform to increase innovation, data-driven decisions and speed in the way we serve our consumers across our channels of distribution.

•

We completed the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York in 2017 and recorded related pre-tax charges of $19 million, including noncash depreciation expense.

•

We purchased a group annuity in 2017 for certain participants of our retirement plans under which certain of our benefit obligations were transferred to an insurer. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $9 million in connection with the noncash settlement of such benefit obligations.  

•

We acquired on April 13, 2016 the 55% ownership interests in our former joint venture for 

TOMMY HILFIGER

 in China that we did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”). As a result of the TH China acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger business in this market. We recorded pre-tax charges of $24 million and $27 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets. 

Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Our results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Accordingly, our results of operations are unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we generate significant revenue and earnings and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. Over 50% of our 2019 revenue was subject to foreign currency translation. The United States dollar strengthened against most major currencies 

 34

in the latter part of 2018 and in 2019, particularly the euro, which is the foreign currency in which we transact the most business. As a result, our 2019 revenue and net income decreased by approximately $215 million and $25 million, respectively, as compared to 2018 due to the impact of foreign currency translation. We currently expect a decrease in our revenue and net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the impact of foreign currency translation.

There is also a transactional impact on our financial results because inventory typically is purchased in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar, as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against a portion of the exposure related to this transactional impact. The contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are generally entered into 12 months in advance of the related inventory purchases. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of the United States dollar on the cost of inventory purchases covered by these contracts may be realized in our results of operations in the year following their inception, as the underlying inventory hedged by the contracts is sold. Our 2019 net income included a slight benefit as compared to 2018 as a result of this transactional impact. However, the unfavorable impact of a strengthening United States dollar against most major currencies in the latter part of 2018 and in 2019, particularly the euro, is expected to negatively impact our gross margin during 2020. Additionally, there is a transactional impact related to changes in SG&A expenses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We currently expect a decrease in our net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the transactional impact.

Further, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our €950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States. The strengthening of the United States dollar against the euro would require us to use a lower amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments, whereas the weakening of the United States dollar against the euro would require us to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments. We designated the carrying amount of these euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. As a result, the remeasurement of these foreign currency borrowings at the end of each period is recorded in equity.

Retail comparable store sales discussed below refer to sales from Company-operated retail stores that have been open and operated by us for at least 12 months, as well as sales from Company-operated digital commerce sites for those businesses and regions that have operated the related digital commerce site for at least 12 months. Sales from retail stores and Company-operated digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales. Sales for retail stores that are relocated, materially altered in size or closed for a prolonged period of time and sales from Company-operated digital commerce sites that are materially altered are also excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales until such stores or sites have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state, as applicable, for at least 12 months. Retail comparable store sales are based on local currencies and comparable weeks. As a result of the 53rd week in 2017, the 2018 retail comparable store sales are more appropriately compared with the 52 week period ended February 4, 2018 (which excludes for this purpose the first week of 2017). As such, all 2018 retail comparable store sales are presented on this shifted basis.

Total Revenue 

Total revenue was $9.909 billion in 2019, $9.657 billion in 2018 and $8.915 billion in 2017. Revenue in 2017 included the benefit of a 53rd week. The increase in revenue of $252 million, or 3%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due principally to the net effect of the following items: 

•

The net addition of an aggregate $367 million of revenue, or an 8% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included a negative impact of $129 million, or 3%, related to foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 15% (including a 5% negative foreign currency impact), 

driven principally by outperformance in Europe and the addition of revenue resulting from the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions

. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 9%, including a benefit of 4% from sales on our digital commerce sites. Revenue in our Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 1%, as growth in the North America wholesale business was more than offset 

by a 6% decline in Tommy Hilfiger North America comparable store sales due to weakness in traffic and consumer spending trends, especially in stores located in international tourist locations. 

•

The net reduction of an aggregate $63 million of revenue, or a 2% decrease compared to the prior year, attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included a negative impact of $85 million, or 2%, related to foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 3% (including a 4% negative foreign currency impact), as continued solid growth in Europe and the addition of revenue resulting from the Australia acquisition were partly offset by the negative impacts of (i) softness experienced in Asia due, in part, to the business disruptions caused by the protests in Hong Kong SAR and the trade tensions between the United States and China and (ii) the reduction of revenue resulting from the CK Collection closure. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales decreased 1%. Revenue in our Calvin Klein North America segment decreased 7%, driven by the effect of the G-III license and a 2% decrease in Calvin Klein North America comparable store sales due to weakness in traffic and consumer spending trends, especially in stores located in international tourist locations.

•

The reduction of an aggregate $52 million of revenue, or a 3% decrease compared the prior year, attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments, primarily due to weakness in the North America wholesale business and a 2% decline in comparable store sales.

 36

The increase in revenue of $742 million, or 8%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due principally to the effect of the following items:

•

The addition of an aggregate $451 million of revenue, or a 12% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included the addition of $49 million, or 1%, related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 15% (including a 2% positive foreign currency impact), driven by strong performance across all regions and channels. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 13%. Revenue in our Tommy Hilfiger North America segment increased 6%, principally attributable to strength in the wholesale business and a 5% increase in Tommy Hilfiger North America comparable store sales.

•

The addition of an aggregate $270 million of revenue, or an 8% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included the addition of $12 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 10%, driven by growth in Europe and Asia. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales increased 5%. Revenue in our Calvin Klein North America segment increased 5% primarily as a result of growth in the wholesale business and a 1% increase in Calvin Klein North America comparable store sales. 

•

The addition of an aggregate $21 million of revenue, or a 1% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments. Comparable store sales increased 1%.

There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and the businesses of our licensees and other business partners. We currently expect that revenue will decrease significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, inclusive of a negative impact related to foreign currency translation, primarily due to the negative impacts to our businesses caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Revenue in 2020 is also expected to decrease by approximately $150 million due to the aggregate net effect of reductions resulting from (i) the Speedo transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, and (ii) the G-III license, which commenced in 2019, partially offset by an addition of revenue resulting from (iii) the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions, which closed in the second quarter of 2019. 

    

Gross Profit

Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, such as inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs and inspection costs. Also included as cost of goods sold are the amounts recognized on foreign currency forward exchange contracts as the underlying inventory hedged by such forward exchange contracts is sold. Warehousing and distribution expenses are included in SG&A expenses. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities.

Gross profit in 2019 was $5.388 billion, or 54.4% of total revenue, as compared to $5.308 billion, or 55.0% of total revenue, in 2018. The 60 basis point decrease in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a gross margin decline in our Tommy Hilfiger North America business due to more promotional selling as compared to the prior year, (ii) the impact of additional inventory reserves recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in anticipation of lower 2020 sales trends as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, (iii) short-lived noncash inventory valuation adjustments recorded in connection with the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions, and (iv) the negative impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported from China into the United States. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger 

 37

International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, as well as gross margin improvements realized in our Calvin Klein North America business.

Gross profit in 2018 was $5.308 billion, or 55.0% of total revenue, as compared to $4.894 billion, or 54.9% of total revenue, in 2017. The 10 basis point increase in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a favorable mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, and (ii) gross margin improvement in our Tommy Hilfiger business. Partially offsetting these increases were gross margin declines in our Calvin Klein and Heritage Brands businesses principally due to more promotional selling. 

We currently expect that gross margin in 2020 will decrease as compared to 2019 primarily due to (i) the need for increased promotional selling and inventory liquidation as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly our European businesses, as the increased local currency value of inventory results in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and the businesses of our licensees and other business partners.

SG&A expenses in 2019 were $4.715 billion, or 47.6% of total revenue, as compared to $4.433 billion, or 45.9% of total revenue in 2018. The 170 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) an increase in costs incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the Socks and Hosiery transaction, and (iii) the costs incurred in connection with the TH U.S. store closures. Also contributing to the increase was a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue. 

SG&A expenses in 2018 were $4.433 billion, or 45.9% of total revenue, as compared to $4.245 billion, or 47.6% of total revenue in 2017. The 170 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to the absence in 2018 of costs that were recorded in 2017 in connection with (i) the Mr. Hilfiger amendment, (ii) the Li & Fung termination, and (iii) the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense. Also contributing to the decrease was a leveraging of expenses in the Tommy Hilfiger business. These decreases were partially offset by (i) a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue, (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring and (iii) an increase in corporate expenses due, in part, to investments in digital and information technology initiatives.

In light of the negative impacts on our business resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are taking measures to significantly reduce SG&A expenses in 2020. As such, we currently expect our SG&A expenses in 2020 will be significantly lower as compared to 2019, including as a result of the reductions resulting from these measures and the absence in 2020 of costs related to (i) the Calvin Klein restructuring, (ii) the Socks and Hosiery transaction and (iii) the TH U.S. store closures. However, we expect our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2020 will increase as compared to 2019 primarily due to a deleveraging of expenses driven by the expected decline in revenue resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and our SG&A expenses may be subject to significant material change, including as a result of noncash impairments of our property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, or goodwill and other intangible assets that we may recognize as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Non-Service Related Pension and Postretirement Cost

Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2019 was $90 million as compared to $5 million in 2018. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2019 and 2018 included actuarial losses on our retirement plans of $98 million and $15 million, respectively. Please see Note 13, “Retirement and Benefit Plans,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2018 was $5 million as compared to $3 million in 2017. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2018 included a $15 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2017 included a $9 million loss recorded in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of our benefit obligations related to our retirement plans as a result of a group annuity purchased for certain participants under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer, as well as a $3 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans. Please see 

Note 13

, “

Retirement and Benefit Plans

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

We currently expect that non-service related pension and postretirement (income) for 2020 will be approximately $15 million compared to non-service related pension and postretirement cost of $90 million in 2019. Our 2019 non-service related pension and postretirement cost included a $98 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans recorded in the fourth quarter. Non-service related pension and postretirement (income) cost recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our results of operations. Our expectation of 2020 non-service related pension and post-retirement income does not include the impact of an actuarial gain or loss. However, if recent market volatility due, in part, to the COVID-19 outbreak continues, we may incur a significant actuarial loss in 2020 as a result of the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets or if there is a decline in discount rates. Our actual 2020 non-service related pension and postretirement (income) cost may be significantly different than our projections.

Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs 

We incurred costs totaling $5 million in 2019 in connection with the refinancing of our senior credit facilities. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

We incurred costs totaling $24 million in 2017 in connection with the early redemption of our $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion. 

Other Noncash Loss, Net

We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Speedo transaction and expected deconsolidation of the net assets of the Speedo North America business, consisting of a noncash impairment of our perpetual license right for the 

Speedo

 trademark, and a noncash loss to reduce the carrying value of the business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Please see Note 4, “Assets Held For Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

We recorded a pre-tax noncash gain of $113 million in the second quarter of 2019 to write up our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value in connection with the Australia acquisition. Please see Note 3, “Acquisitions,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates

The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates was $10 million in 2019 as compared to $21 million in 2018 and $10 million in 2017. These amounts relate to our share of income (loss) from PVH Australia (prior to acquiring it on May 31, 2019 through the Australia acquisition), our joint venture for the 

TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN, Warner’s, Olga 

and 

Speedo 

brands in Mexico, our joint ventures for the 

TOMMY HILFIGER

 brand in India and Brazil, our joint venture for the 

CALVIN KLEIN

 brand in India, and our newly formed PVH Legwear joint venture for the 

TOMMY HILFIGER

, 

CALVIN KLEIN

, 

IZOD

, 

Van Heusen

 and 

Warner’s

 brands and other owned and licensed trademarks in the United States and Canada. (PVH Legwear began operations in December 2019.) Also included is our share of income (loss) from our investments in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V. (“Karl Lagerfeld”) and in Gazal (prior to acquiring it on May 31, 2019 through the Australia 

 39

acquisition). The equity in net income for 2019 decreased as compared to 2018, primarily due to having only a partial year of income from our investments in Gazal and PVH Australia and one-time expenses of $2 million recorded on our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia prior to the Australia acquisition closing. Our investments in the continuing joint ventures and Karl Lagerfeld are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the closing of the Australia acquisition, we began to consolidate the operations of Gazal and PVH Australia into our financial statements. Please see the section entitled “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion. 

We currently expect that our equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates for 2020 will include an increase in income on our investment in PVH Legwear as compared to 2019, as we recognize a full year of income in 2020, offset by a decrease in income on our investments due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our unconsolidated affiliates’ businesses in 2020.

Interest Expense, Net

Net interest expense decreased to $115 million in 2019 from $116 million in 2018 primarily due to lower interest rates on our senior unsecured credit facilities as compared to 2018, partially offset by the $9 million loss on remeasurement of our mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest that was recognized in connection with the Australia acquisition. Please see the section entitled “Financing Arrangements” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

Net interest expense decreased to $116 million in 2018 from $122 million in 2017 primarily due to (i) the net impact of the early redemption of our $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes in January 2018 and issuance of €600 million euro-denominated 3 1/8% senior notes in December 2017 and (ii) the cumulative impact of long-term debt repayments made during 2018 and 2017, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings and interest rates as compared to 2017. Please see the section entitled “Financing Arrangements” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

We currently expect that net interest expense in 2020 will increase as compared to 2019. We have increased the aggregate borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, other short-term revolving credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper note program in 2020 to approximately $930 million in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business, and we expect that we may further increase our borrowings under existing or new financing arrangements. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and our interest expense may be subject to further significant increase.

The United States Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Legislation”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revised the United States tax code. The revisions that significantly impact us are (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, (ii) the imposition of a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated, (iii) the implementation of a modified territorial tax system, (iv) the introduction of a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (known as “GILTI”) and a beneficial tax rate to be applied against foreign derived intangible income (known as “FDII”) and (v) the introduction of a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (known as “BEAT”) that taxes certain payments between United States corporations and their subsidiaries. 

We recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, consisting of a $265 million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $38 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits and a $174 million transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our final analysis of the impacts of the U.S. Tax Legislation and recorded a net tax benefit of $25 million to adjust the provisional amount recorded in 2017, during the measurement period allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $25 million net 

 40

tax benefit included the release of a $26 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits, partially offset by a $2 million expense related to the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities. 

We file income tax returns in more than 40 international jurisdictions each year. A substantial amount of our earnings are in international jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands and Hong Kong SAR, where income tax rates, coupled with special rates levied on income from certain of our jurisdictional activities, are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate, and reduced our consolidated effective income tax rate during 2019, 2018 and 2017. We expect to benefit from these special rates until 2022. The reduction in the United States statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate due to our mix of earnings.

Our effective income tax rate for 2019 was lower than the 21.0% United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation and the settlement of a multi-year audit from an international jurisdiction, which together resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 11.8%, and (ii) the favorable impact of a tax exemption on the noncash gain recorded to write-up our existing equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value in connection with the Australia acquisition, which resulted in a 5.4% benefit to our effective income tax rate. 

The effective income tax rate for 2019 was 6.5% compared with 4.0% in 2018. The 2019 effective income tax rate was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2018 primarily due to (i) the absence of a 5.3% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate related to the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the legislation enacted in the Netherlands known as the “2019 Dutch Tax Plan” and (ii) the absence of a 3.2% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate related to the U.S. Tax Legislation, partially offset by (iii) a favorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity of 8.1%, which includes the benefit to our 2019 effective income tax rate resulting from settlement of a multi-year audit from an international jurisdiction. The variance between the 2019 and 2018 effective income tax rates is also affected by the substantial change in our pre-tax income, which was $444 million in 2019 and $776 million in 2018. As a result, the effect that discrete tax amounts have on the effective income tax rate in each year is not comparable. 

Our effective income tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21.0% United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) a $41 million benefit from the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the enactment of the 2019 Dutch Tax Plan, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 5.3%, (ii) the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 3.7%, (iii) a net tax benefit of $25 million recorded in 2018 to adjust the provisional amount recorded in 2017 in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 3.2%, and (iv) the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns.

The effective income tax rate for 2018 was 4.0% compared with (5.1)% in 2017. The 2018 effective income tax rate was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2017 primarily due to (i) a lower net benefit recorded in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a 3.2% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate compared with a 10.4% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate, (ii) an unfavorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity of 3.8%, and (iii) the absence of a 3.0% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate resulting from an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. These unfavorable impacts to our effective income tax rate for 2018 were partially offset by a 5.3% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate from the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the 2019 Dutch Tax Plan.

As a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation, which reduced the United States statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, our United States statutory income tax rate for 2017 was a blended rate of 33.7%. Our effective income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) the provisional net benefit of $53 million recorded in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 10.4%, (ii) the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns, and (iii) the overall benefit of certain discrete items, including the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions and an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which resulted in benefits to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 7.5% and 3.0%, respectively.

Given the significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and results of operations, we are not able to estimate our effective income tax rate in 2020.

 41

Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and new regulations, as well as audits by tax authorities and the receipt of new information, which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. Please see

Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

We have a joint venture in Ethiopia with Arvind Limited, in which we own a 75% interest. We consolidate the results of PVH Ethiopia in our consolidated financial statements. PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that produces finished products for us for distribution primarily in the United States. The manufacturing facility began operations in 2017. 

The net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest in PVH Ethiopia was immaterial in 2019, 2018 and 2017. We currently expect that the net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest for 2020 will also be immaterial. Please see

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow Summary

Cash and cash equivalents at 

February 2, 2020

 was $503 million, an increase of $51 million from the amount at 

February 3, 2019

 of $452 million. The change in cash and cash equivalents included the impact of (i) $325 million of common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program, (ii) $71 million of long-term debt repayments, (iii) a $59 million net payment made in connection with the Australia acquisition, and (iv) a $74 million payment made in connection with the TH CSAP acquisition.

Cash flow in 2020 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section, including (i) mandatory long-term debt repayments of approximately $14 million, subject to exchange rate fluctuations, (ii) common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program of $111

 

million, which reflects stock repurchases through March 2020 with no further repurchases planned for the remainder of 2020, and (iii) the expected proceeds of $170 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, related to the Speedo transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, in March 2020 we increased the aggregate borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, other short-term revolving credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper note program to approximately $930 million, in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, our estimates of cash flows in 2020 may be subject to material significant change, including as a result of the actual impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our 2020 earnings, additional borrowings under existing or new financing arrangements, excess inventories, delays in collection of, or inability to collect on, certain trade receivables, and other working capital changes that we may experience as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

As of February 2, 2020, approximately $405 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. Our intent is to reinvest indefinitely substantially all of our earnings in foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. However, if management decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the United States, we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes, including any applicable foreign withholding tax and United States state income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

 

Operations

Cash provided by operating activities was $1.020 billion in 2019 compared to $852 million in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by changes in working capital, including a favorable change in trade receivables and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in net income as adjusted for noncash charges.

In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we were obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the acquisition agreement, as amended) of products bearing any of the 

CALVIN KLEIN

 brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the 

 42

sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein were made were wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Contingent purchase price payments totaled $16 million and $56 million

 

in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The final payment due to Mr. Klein was made in the second quarter of 2018.

Capital Expenditures

    

Our capital expenditures in 2019 were $345 million compared to $379 million in 2018. The capital expenditures in 2019 primarily related to (i) investments in new stores and store expansions, (ii) investments to upgrade and enhance our operating, supply chain and logistics systems and our digital commerce platforms and (iii) the expansion of our warehouse and distribution network in North America. We currently expect that capital expenditures for 2020 will decrease to approximately $190 million and will include only certain minimum required expenditures in our retail stores and expenditures for projects currently in progress, primarily related to (i) investments to support the multi-year upgrade of our platforms and systems worldwide and (ii) enhancements to our warehouse and distribution network. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, our estimates of capital expenditures in 2020 may be subject to change. Our capital expenditures may differ materially compared to our current expectations as a result.

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We own a 49% economic interest in our newly formed PVH Legwear joint venture. We made payments of $

28

 million to PVH Legwear during 

2019

 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding. 

We held an approximately 

22%

 ownership interest in Gazal and a 

50%

 ownership interest in PVH Australia until the closing of the Australia acquisition on May 31, 2019. These investments were accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We derecognized our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia and began to consolidate the operations of Gazal and PVH Australia in our financial statements effective with the closing of the transaction. We received aggregate dividends of $6 million, $8 million and $4 million from Gazal and PVH Australia during 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. 

We acquired a 51% economic interest in a joint venture, Calvin Klein Arvind Fashion Private Limited (“CK India”) in 2013. We sold 1% of our interest for $400,000 in 2017, decreasing our economic interest in CK India to 50%. Prior to the sale, we were not deemed to hold a controlling interest in CK India as the shareholders agreement provided the partners with equal rights. CK India licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the 

CALVIN KLEIN

 trademarks in India for certain product categories. We made payments of $2 million to CK India during 2017 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding.

We own a 50% economic interest in a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited (“TH India”). TH India licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the 

TOMMY HILFIGER

 trademarks in India for certain product categories. Arvind, our joint venture partner in PVH Ethiopia and CK India, is also our joint venture partner in TH India. We made payments of $3 million to TH India during 2017 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding.

We formed with two other parties a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A. (“TH Brazil”), in 2012, in which we have a 40% economic interest. We acquired an approximately 1% additional interest for $300,000 in 2017, increasing our economic interest in TH Brazil to approximately 41%. TH Brazil licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the 

TOMMY HILFIGER 

trademarks in Brazil for certain product categories. We made payments of $3 million to TH Brazil during 2017 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding. We issued a note receivable to TH Brazil in 2016 for $12 million, of which $6 million was repaid in 2016 and the remaining balance, including accrued interest, was repaid in 2017.

We, along with Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I. de C.V., formed a joint venture (“PVH Mexico”) in 2016, in which we own a 49% economic interest. PVH Mexico licenses from certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain 

TOMMY HILFIGER

, 

CALVIN KLEIN

, 

Warner’s

, 

Olga

 and 

Speedo

 brand products in Mexico. We received dividends of $

7

 million from PVH Mexico during 2019.

Payments made to contribute our share of the joint ventures funding and the repayment of the note receivable we issued to TH Brazil were included in our net cash used by investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the respective period. The dividends received from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates were included in our net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the respective period.

Loan to a Supplier

Wuxi Jinmao Foreign Trade Co., Ltd. (“Wuxi”), one of our finished goods inventory suppliers, has a wholly owned subsidiary with which we entered into a loan agreement in 2016. Under the agreement, Wuxi’s subsidiary borrowed a principal amount of $14 million for the development and operation of a fabric mill. Principal payments are due in semi-annual installments beginning March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2026. The outstanding principal balance of the loan bears interest at a rate of (i) 4.50% per annum until the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the loan and (ii) LIBOR plus 4.00% thereafter. We received principal payments of $400,000 and $200,000 during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The outstanding balance, including accrued interest, was $13 million and $14 million as of 

February 2, 2020

 and 

February 3, 2019

, respectively. 

TH CSAP Acquisition

Dividends

Our common stock has historically paid annual dividends, which totaled $0.15 per share in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017. Dividends on common stock totaled $11 million in 2019 and $12 million in each of 2018 and 2017.

We declared a $0.0375 per share dividend payable to our common stockholders of record as of March 4, 2020, in respect of which we made dividend payments totaling approximately $3 million on March 31, 2020. We have suspended our dividend policy in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. If we were to pay cash dividends totaling $0.15 per share on our common stock in 2020, such dividends would total approximately $11 million based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of 

 44

February 2, 2020

, our estimate of stock to be issued during 2020 under our stock incentive plans and our estimate of stock repurchases during 2020.

Acquisition of Treasury Shares

Our Board of Directors has authorized over time since 2015 an aggregate $

2.0

 billion stock repurchase program through June 3, 2023. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as we deem appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board of Directors, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we purchased approximately 3.4 million shares, 2.2 million shares and 2.2 million shares, respectively, of our common stock under the program in open market transactions for $325 million, $300 million and $250 million, respectively. Purchases of $500,000 were accrued for in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 

February 2, 2020

. Purchases of $2 million that were accrued for in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 

February 4, 2018

 were paid in 2018. The repurchased shares were held as treasury stock and $683 million of the authorization remained available for future share repurchases as of 

February 2, 2020

. 

Treasury stock activity also includes shares that were withheld principally in conjunction with the settlement of restricted stock units and performance share units to satisfy tax withholding requirements.

Mandatorily Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

    

The Australia acquisition agreement provided for key members of Gazal and PVH Australia management to exchange a portion of their interests in Gazal for approximately 

6%

 of the outstanding shares in our previously wholly owned subsidiary that acquired 

100%

 of the ownership interests in the Australia business. We are obligated to purchase this 

6%

 interest within two years of the acquisition closing in two tranches as follows: tranche 1 – 

50%

 of the shares 

one year after the closing

, but the holders had the option to defer half of this tranche to tranche 2; and tranche 2 – all remaining shares 

two years after the closing

. With respect to tranche 1, the holders elected not to defer their shares to tranche 2 and as a result we are obligated to purchase all of the tranche 1 shares in the second quarter of 2020. The purchase price for the tranche 1 and tranche 2 shares is based on a multiple of the subsidiary’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) less net debt as of the end of the measurement year, and the multiple varies depending on the level of EBITDA compared to a target. The liability for the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest was $33.8 million as of February 2, 2020 based on exchange rates in effect on that date, of which $16.9 million is payable in the second quarter of 2020 for the purchase of the tranche 1 shares.

In addition, we had $503 million and $452 million of cash and cash equivalents as of 

February 2, 2020

 and 

February 3, 2019

, respectively. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

We have the ability to draw revolving borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facilities, as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. We had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of 

 45

February 2, 2020

. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings outstanding under these facilities during 

2019

 was $

378

 million. We had $

8

 million outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facilities as of 

February 3, 2019

 as discussed in the section entitled “2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities” below. The weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed as of 

February 3, 2019

 was 

4.45

%. 

Additionally, we have the availability to borrow under short-term lines of credit, overdraft facilities and short-term revolving credit facilities denominated in various foreign currencies. These facilities, which now include a facility in Australia as a result of the Australia acquisition, provided for borrowings of up to $

132

 million based on exchange rates in effect on 

February 2, 2020

 and are utilized primarily to fund working capital needs. We had $

50

 million and $

5

 million outstanding under these facilities as of 

February 2, 2020

 and 

February 3, 2019

, respectively. The $50 million of borrowings outstanding as of 

February 2, 2020

 included borrowings under the facility in Australia. The weighted average interest rate on funds borrowed as of 

February 2, 2020

 and 

February 3, 2019

 was 

2.56

% and 

0.21

%, respectively. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during 

2019

 was $99 million.

Commercial Paper

    

We established on November 5, 2019 an unsecured commercial paper note program in the United States primarily to fund working capital needs. The program enables us to issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities that vary but do not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper note program as of February 2, 2020. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under the program during 2019 was $370 million.

The commercial paper program allows for borrowings of up to $

675

 million to the extent that we have borrowing capacity under our United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. Accordingly, the combined aggregate amount of (i) borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper note program and (ii) the revolving borrowings outstanding under the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility at any one time cannot exceed $675 million. The maximum aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility during 2019 was $567 million, which reflects a brief period of higher aggregate borrowings at the time that we launched the commercial paper program.

Finance Lease Obligations

Our cash payments for finance lease obligations totaled $5 million in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.

2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities

On May 19, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit facilities (as amended, the “2016 facilities”). We replaced the 2016 facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities on April 29, 2019 as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. The 2016 facilities, as of the date they were replaced, consisted of a $2.347 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility and senior secured revolving credit facilities consisting of (i) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (ii) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars and Canadian dollars and (iii) a €186 million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen and Swiss francs. 

2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities

We refinanced the 2016 facilities on April 29, 2019 (the “Closing Date”) by entering into senior unsecured credit facilities (the “2019 facilities”), the proceeds of which, along with cash on hand, were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the 2016 facilities, as well as the related debt issuance costs.

The 2019 facilities consist of a $1.093 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility (the “USD TLA facility”), a €500 million euro-denominated Term Loan A facility (the “Euro TLA facility” and together with the USD TLA facility, the “TLA facilities”) and senior unsecured revolving credit facilities consisting of (i) a $675 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (ii) a CAD $70 million Canadian dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars, (iii) a €200 million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Australian dollars and other agreed foreign currencies and (iv) a $50 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Hong Kong dollars. The 

 46

2019 facilities are due on April 29, 2024. In connection with the refinancing of our senior credit facilities, we paid debt issuance costs of $10 million (of which $3 million was expensed as debt modification costs and $7 million is being amortized over the term of the debt agreement) and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $2 million to write off previously capitalized debt issuance costs.

Each of the senior unsecured revolving facilities, except for the $50 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Hong Kong dollars, also include amounts available for letters of credit and have a portion available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more senior unsecured term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. The lenders under the 2019 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments.

We had loans outstanding of $1.570 billion, net of debt issuance costs and based on applicable exchange rates, under the TLA facilities and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities as of 

February 2, 2020

. We had no borrowings outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities as of February 2, 2020. 

 

The terms of the TLA facilities require us to make quarterly repayments of amounts outstanding under the 2019 facilities, which commenced with the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2019. Such required repayment amounts equal 2.50% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the first eight calendar quarters following the Closing Date, 5.00% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the four calendar quarters thereafter and 7.50% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the remaining calendar quarters, in each case paid in equal installments and in each case subject to certain customary adjustments, with the balance due on the maturity date of the TLA facilities. The outstanding borrowings under the 2019 facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). Any voluntary repayments we make would reduce the future required repayment amounts.

We made payments of $71 million on our term loans under the 2019 facilities and we repaid the 2016 facilities in connection with the refinancing of the senior credit facilities during 2019. We made payments of $150 million and $250 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively, on our term loans under the 2016 facilities.

The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers' acceptances having a term of one month or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

Borrowings available in Hong Kong dollars under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The borrowings under the 2019 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars, Canadian dollars or Hong Kong dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The current applicable margin with respect to the TLA facilities and each revolving credit facility is 1.375% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.375% for base rate or Canadian prime rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the TLA facilities and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment (i) after the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements, with respect to each of our fiscal quarters, based upon our net leverage ratio or (ii) after the date of delivery of notice of a change in our public debt rating by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.

 47

We entered into interest rate swap agreements designed with the intended effect of converting notional amounts of our variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreements, for the outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we pay a fixed rate plus the current applicable margin.

The notional amounts of the outstanding interest rate swaps that commenced in February 2018 and February 2019 are adjusted according to pre-set schedules during the terms of the swap agreements such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the USD TLA facility is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps.

4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022

We had outstanding $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. We redeemed these notes on January 5, 2018 in connection with the issuance of €600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027, as discussed below. We paid a premium of $16 million to the holders of these notes in connection with the redemption and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $8 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with these notes during 2017.

7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 

We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due November 15, 2023 that accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%. The debentures are not redeemable at our option prior to maturity.

3 5/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2024 

We have outstanding €

350

 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024. Interest on the notes is payable in euros. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to April 15, 2024 by paying a “make whole” premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after April 15, 2024 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

3 1/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2027

We issued on December 21, 2017 €

600

 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027. Interest on the notes is payable in euros. We paid €

9

 million (approximately $

10

 million based on exchange rates in effect on the payment date) of fees during 2017 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to September 15, 2027 by paying a “make whole” premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after September 15, 2027 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 

    

Our financing arrangements contain financial and non-financial covenants and customary events of default. As of 

February 2, 2020

, we were in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants under our financing arrangements.

 48

As of 

February 2, 2020

, our issuer credit was rated BBB- by Standard & Poor’s with a stable outlook and our corporate credit was rated Baa3 by Moody’s with a stable outlook, and our commercial paper was rated A-3 by Standard & Poor’s and P-3 by Moody’s. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies, our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors.

Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements.

MARKET RISK

Financial instruments held by us as of 

February 2, 2020

 include cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. 

Note 12

, “

Fair Value Measurements

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of 

February 2, 2020

. Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates, which are currently low. The potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash and cash equivalents and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at 

February 2, 2020

, the effect of a 10 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $500,000 annually. Borrowings under our 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our 2019 facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of 

February 2, 2020

, after taking into account the effect of our interest rate swap agreements that were in effect as of such date, approximately 55% of our long-term debt was at a fixed interest rate, with the remainder at variable interest rates. Given our long-term debt position at 

February 2, 2020

, the effect of a 10 basis point change in interest rates on our variable interest expense would be approximately $1 million annually. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements.

Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Over 50% of our $9.909 billion of revenue in 2019 was generated outside of the United States. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translational impact and a transactional impact. 

The translational impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our results of operations and financial position. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally the applicable local currencies. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period and the assets and liabilities in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences that arise from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities into United States dollars are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive (loss) income. Accordingly, our results of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese yuan renminbi, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. 

Our 2019 revenues and net income decreased by approximately $215 million and $25 million, respectively, as compared to 2018 due to the impact of foreign currency translation. We currently expect a decrease in our revenue and net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the impact of foreign currency translation.

In addition, in 2019 we recognized unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $158 million within other comprehensive (loss) income principally driven by a strengthening of the United States dollar against the euro of 4% since 

February 3, 2019

. Our foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income are significantly impacted by the substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets denominated in the euro, which represented 33% of our $7.2 billion total goodwill and other intangible assets as of 

February 2, 2020

. This translational impact was partially mitigated by the change in the fair value of our net investment hedges discussed below.

A transactional impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany transactions and SG&A expenses. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these 

 51

inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries.

    

We currently expect a decrease in our net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the transactional impact.

Given our foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at 

February 2, 2020

, the effect of a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $105 million. Any change in the fair value of these contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. 

In order to mitigate a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries denominated in the euro, we designated the carrying amount of our €950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. The effect of a 10% change in the euro against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of the net investment hedges of approximately $105 million. Any change in the fair value of the net investment hedges would be more than offset by a change in the value of our investments in certain of our European subsidiaries. Additionally, during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a lower amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on our euro-denominated senior notes, whereas during times of a weakening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on these notes.

Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $7 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost of approximately $45 million.

SEASONALITY

Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in 

Note 1

, “

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations:

Sales allowances and returns

—We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical experience, an evaluation of current sales trends and market conditions, and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for sales allowances and inventory returns. Our historical accrual estimates have not differed materially from actual results. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals.

 52

Inventories—

Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for certain retail inventories in North America that are stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method. Cost for substantially all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail inventories in Asia is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory aging and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and record inventories at either the lower of cost or net realizable value or the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method, as applicable. We believe that all inventory write-downs required at 

February 2, 2020

 have been recorded. Our historical estimates of inventory reserves have not differed materially from actual results. If market conditions were to change, including as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted.

Asset impairments

—We determined during each of 2019, 2018 and 2017 that long-lived assets, primarily in certain of our retail stores and shop-in-shops, were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. Additionally, during 2019 we determined that certain operating lease right-of-use assets were impaired primarily as a result of the closure of certain flagship and anchor stores in the United States. In order to calculate these impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. Undiscounted future cash flows were estimated using current sales trends and other factors and, in the case of operating lease right-of-use assets, using estimated sublease income assumptions. If different assumptions had been used, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. 

Note 12

, “

Fair Value Measurements

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

—Trade receivables, as presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts.

Income taxes

—Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded.

During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

 

Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results have differed materially in the past and could differ materially in the future from our current estimates.

The U.S. Tax Legislation was enacted on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revised the United States tax code. Please see

Goodwill and other intangible assets

—

 

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.

 53

We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents our weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potential impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. For goodwill, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 

For the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for all reporting units and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The annual goodwill impairment test during 2019 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for all of our reporting units and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. The reporting unit with the least excess fair value had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by 

15%

. No impairment of goodwill resulted from our annual impairment test in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Speedo transaction was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting unit, the reporting unit that includes the Speedo North America business, could be impaired, prompting the need to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test. Please see Note 8, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

For the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The annual goodwill impairment test during 2018 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for our reporting units, all of which had fair values in excess of the carrying amounts by more than 50%, and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. No impairment of goodwill resulted from our annual impairment test in 2018.

For the 2019 annual impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for the Australia reacquired perpetual license rights, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. For the Australia reacquired perpetual license rights, since only a few months had passed since the acquisition on May 31, 2019 and the business had performed better than initially expected, we determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reacquired perpetual license rights were less than the carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. The fair values of all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceed their carrying amounts, with the exception of the perpetual license right related to our Speedo North America business, which had a fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by 3% at the testing date. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Speedo transaction was a triggering event that prompted the need to perform an interim impairment test of this perpetual license right. As a result of this interim test, the perpetual license right was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $116 million was recorded to other noncash loss, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Please see

Assets Held For Sale

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. 

For the 2018 annual impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for the 

Geoffrey Beene

 tradename, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. For the 

Geoffrey Beene

 tradename, since only a few months had passed since the acquisition on April 20, 2018 and there had not been any significant changes in the business, we determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this tradename was less than the carrying amount and concluded that the 

 54

quantitative impairment test was not required. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment tests in 2018.

If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed in 2019 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. For example, if general macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or otherwise vary from current assumptions (including those resulting in changes in the weighted average cost of capital), industry or market conditions deteriorate, business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including cost increases or loss of major customers, our businesses do not perform as projected, or there is an extended period of a significant decline in our stock price, this could be an indicator that the excess fair value of our reporting units could be lessened and the chance of an impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could be raised. 

Pension and Benefit Plans

—Pension and benefit plan expenses are recorded throughout the year based on calculations using actuarial valuations that incorporate estimates and assumptions that depend in part on financial market, economic and demographic conditions, including expected long-term rate of return on assets, discount rate and mortality rates. These assumptions require significant judgment. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from our actuarial assumptions, are recognized in the year in which they occur and could have a material impact on our operating results. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on historical returns and the level of risk premium associated with the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested as well as expectations for the long-term future returns of each asset class. The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. The expected return on plan assets is recognized quarterly and determined at the beginning of the year by applying the long-term expected rate of return on assets to the actual fair value of plan assets adjusted for expected benefit payments, contributions and plan expenses. At the end of the year, the fair value of the assets is remeasured and any difference between the actual return on assets and the expected return is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss. 

The discount rate is determined based on current market interest rates. It is selected by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that matches the cash flows from interest payments and principal maturities of the portfolio to the timing of benefit payments to participants. The yield on such a portfolio is the basis for the selected discount rate. Service and interest cost is measured using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year, while the projected benefit obligation is measured using the discount rate as of the end of the year. The impact of the change in the discount rate on our projected benefit obligation is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss.

We revised during each of 2019 and 2018 the mortality assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations based on recently published actuarial mortality tables. These changes in life expectancy resulted in changes to the period for which we expect benefits to be paid. In 2019 and 2018, the decrease in life expectancy decreased our benefit obligations and future expense. 

We also periodically review and revise, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, and termination based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. We have not historically had significant adjustments to these assumptions. 

Actual results could differ from our assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future net benefit cost. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $7 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost of approximately $45 million. 

Note 13

, “

Retirement and Benefit Plans

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth certain significant rate assumptions and information regarding our target asset allocation, which are used in performing calculations related to our pension plans.

Stock-based compensation

—Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation cost over the service period for 

 55

awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and restricted stock units is recognized as expense over the service period, net of actual forfeitures. 

The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions is established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Certain contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions are also subject to a holding period of one year after the vesting date. For such awards, the grant date fair value is discounted for the restriction of liquidity, which is calculated using the Chaffe model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of actual forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.
