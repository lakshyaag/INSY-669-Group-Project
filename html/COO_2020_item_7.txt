Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Note numbers refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for fiscal 

2020

 compared with fiscal 

2019

. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” For a discussion related to fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended October 31, 2019, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 20, 2019, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.coopercos.com.

Within the tables presented, percentages are calculated based on the underlying whole-dollar amounts and, therefore, may not recalculate exactly from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The succeeding sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) may include certain financial measures that are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These measures, which are referred to as non-GAAP measures, are listed below:

•

Free Cash Flow 

- Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.

•

Constant currency 

- Constant currency is defined as excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.

For a discussion of these measures and the reasons management believes they are useful to investors, refer to “Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. To the extent applicable, this MD&A includes reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies.

COVID-19 Considerations

The World Health Organization categorized the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis, along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties, which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally. As a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic, governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the COVID-19 virus, many optical practitioners and retailers, hospitals, medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities, restricted access, or delayed or canceled patient visits, exams and elective medical procedures, and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits. This has had, and we believe will continue to have, an adverse effect on our sales, operating results and cash flows.

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We have taken an active role in addressing the ongoing pandemic’s impact on our employees, suppliers, distribution channels, operations and customers, including taking precautionary measures, such as implementing contingency plans, and making operational adjustments as necessary. We have taken measures to help ensure the safety of our personnel in all our facilities, and we have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide.

As of the date of this filing, we have not experienced any significant disruption at our manufacturing facilities. We have had no significant disruption in our access to necessary raw materials and other supplies or with our distribution network; however, we have experienced higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs, labor inefficiencies, higher cost of production and higher freight charges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we instituted an inventory control project to reduce buildup of excess inventory. Our manufacturing and distribution operations have responded to the impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have been able to continue to supply our products around the world without interruption. In the future, we may decide or need to implement additional precautionary measures or operational adjustments as we deem prudent to meet consumer demand or to help further ensure employee safety. We believe that the actions we are taking have enabled us to keep our employees safe and our supply chain intact and will help us emerge from this global pandemic operationally sound and well positioned for long-term growth.

The extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition will depend on future developments. At this time, future developments are highly uncertain, difficult to predict and largely outside of our control. These include, but are not limited to, the spread, duration and severity of the pandemic outbreak and any subsequent waves of additional outbreaks, actions taken by governments to contain the pandemic, address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We will continue to closely monitor the developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses from governments and private sector participants and their respective impact on our Company and on our customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners.

For more information on the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" herein.

Outlook

Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and general health care markets. However, the impact, risks and uncertainty relating to the global COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, as further described in the “COVID-19 Considerations” section above and in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this filing, have adversely affected our sales, cash flow and current performance and are likely to further adversely affect our future sales, cash flow and performance. Additionally, other events affecting the economy as a whole, including but not limited to the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility, changes in tax legislation, debt concerns, the uncertainty during and after the transition period following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU, changes to existing regulations and new regulations, global trade barriers including additional tariffs and the trend of consolidations within the health care industry could impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our future performance.

CooperVision

wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. CooperVision also competes in the myopia management and specialty eye care markets with products such as ortho-k and scleral lenses. In November 2019, CooperVision received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its MiSight

®

 1 day lens, which is the first and only FDA-approved product indicated to slow the progression of myopia in children with treatment initiated between the ages of 8-12 and became available in the United States during fiscal 2020. CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration using recently introduced products, and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, including through acquisitions. 

On August 7, 2020, CooperVision completed the acquisition of a privately-held U.S contact lens manufacturer focusing on ortho-k lenses. This acquisition expands CooperVision’s specialty eye care portfolio and its leadership in addressing the increasing severity and prevalence of myopia.

On December 28, 2018, CooperVision completed the acquisition of a privately-held scleral lens company, which expands CooperVision's specialty and scleral lens portfolio.

Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability. CooperVision manufactures and markets a wide variety of silicone hydrogel contact lenses. Our single-use silicone hydrogel product franchises, clariti

® 

and MyDay

®

, remain a focus as we expect increasing demand for these products as well as future single-use products as the global contact lens market continues to shift to this modality. Outside of single-use, the Biofinity

®

 and Avaira Vitality

®

 product families comprise our focus in the FRP, or frequent replacement product, market which encompasses the 2-week and monthly modalities. Included in this segment are unique products such as Biofinity Energys

®

, which helps individuals with digital eye fatigue.

CooperSurgical -

 Our CooperSurgical business competes in the general health care market with a commitment to advancing the health of women, babies and families through its diversified portfolio of products and services focusing on women's health and fertility. CooperSurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies, products and services that complement its business model. 

CooperSurgical acquired a privately-held distributor of IVF medical devices and systems on December 13, 2019.

On December 31, 2018, CooperSurgical acquired a privately-held U.S. medical device company that develops mechanical surgical solutions for skin closure.

Rate (LIBOR), announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. Further, in March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04, 

Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting

. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and is continuing to monitor this activity and evaluate the related risk. We are continuing to evaluate the scope of impacted contracts and the potential impact. We are also monitoring the developments regarding alternative rates and may amend certain contracts to accommodate those rates if the contract does not already specify a replacement rate. While the notional value of agreements potentially indexed to LIBOR is material, we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the expected impact.

We believe that current cash, cash equivalents and future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements included in this annual report. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as that for acquisitions, share repurchases, cash dividends or other activities as we execute our business strategy, we anticipate that additional funds will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

CooperVision Net Sales

The contact lens market has two major product categories:

•

Spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects

•

Toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.

:

•

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business. Net sales in fiscal 2020 declined by 7%, compared to fiscal 2019. Customers have either slowed down purchases or delayed orders due to a desire to reduce inventories, reduced contact lens wear driven by limited social interaction and lack of patient access on account of certain office closures and reduced access as offices reopen. We started experiencing downward pressure on net sales when markets started

 

closing during our second quarter of fiscal 2020 as social restrictions were put in place and the offices of health care providers were closed

•

CooperVision’s net sales declined across product categories and all our markets, however the net sales decline was partially offset by higher sales of MyDay, MiSight and Biofinity Energys

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

•

Total silicone hydrogel products decreased by 4%, representing 74% of net sales in the fiscal 2020 compared to 72% in fiscal 2019

•

Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately $2.4 million, compared to a negative impact of $53.6 million in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, net sales decreased 6% in constant currency over the prior year

•

Sales reduction was primarily driven by a decrease in the volume of lenses sold. Average realized prices by product did not materially influence sales

•

We expect to continue seeing downward pressure on net sales if the COVID-19 pandemic continues, optical retailers and healthcare centers continue to restrict access, and social distancing measures continue.

:

•

We have experienced COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruptions and decline in net sales during fiscal 2020. We experienced downward pressure on revenue when major markets started closing as social restrictions were put in place and the offices of certain health care providers were closed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as a precautionary measure, certain health care facilities and medical offices were closed or restricted access and surgeries and elective medical procedures and exams have been deferred or canceled. Further, there has been a significant reduction in physician office visits, and healthcare centers have postponed or canceled capital purchases 

•

Office and surgical products decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to reduction in PARAGARD IUD sales. Further, there has been a reduction in revenue from other surgical products such as Uterine Manipulators and Closure products, partially offset by an increase in revenue from Incisive Surgical and Endosee products

•

Fertility net sales declined compared to the prior year mainly due to reduction in revenue from IVF consumables and equipment 

•

Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted sales by approximately $2.1 million, compared to a negative impact of $9.0 million in the prior year. In fiscal 2020, net sales decreased 13% in constant currency over the prior year

SGA expense remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, SGA increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, due to salaries and benefits, selling, advertising and marketing activities, and fixed General and Administrative (G&A) costs.

CooperVision's SGA remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to advertising and marketing activities, including MiSight and increase in G&A costs, partially, offset by lower travel expenses. CooperVision's SGA in fiscal 2020 included $6.5 million primarily related to acquisition and integration activities. CooperVision's SGA in fiscal 2019 included $7.1 million of acquisition costs, integration costs and costs related to new product launches.

The decrease in CooperSurgical's SGA in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower selling and distribution expenses due to lower sales and savings from lower travel expenses, partially offset by an increase in G&A costs. CooperSurgical's SGA in fiscal 2020, included $19.8 million, primarily related to integration expenses and MDR costs. CooperSurgical's SGA in fiscal 2019 included $19.6 million of acquisition and integration expenses of acquired companies, as well as MDR costs.

Corporate SGA increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense.

The operating income for fiscal 2020 was primarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted from a decrease to our net sales and additional expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic related costs as discussed above.

CooperVision operating income decreased as a percentage of net sales and in absolute dollars in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in net sales partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and a decrease in amortization expenses.

CooperSurgical operating income decreased as a percentage of net sales and in absolute dollars in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in net sales and higher R&D expenses to support growth partially offset by a decrease in SGA. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, CooperSurgical sold an exclusive distribution right to distribute Filshie Clip System in the U.S. for $21.0 million and recognized a gain of $19.0 million.

Corporate operating loss increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense.

Foreign exchange loss primarily resulted from the revaluation and settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances.

Other expense (income) increased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to non-consolidated subsidiary investments losses and advances during the year.

Provision for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate (ETR) was 10.6% and 2.3% for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. The ETR in fiscal 2020 increased in comparison to fiscal 2019 primarily due to foreign earnings subject to US tax, partially offset by a shift in the geographic mix of income.

The ETR for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was less than the US federal statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, a step-up of the US tax-deductible basis of intellectual property rights from intra-entity sales and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This was partially offset by foreign earnings subject to US tax. The jurisdictions with lower tax rates with the most significant tax impact include Barbados, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. See Note 6. Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

We grant various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares and restricted stock units. The share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2020 was $38.6 and $4.8, respectively, compared to $36.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2019. As of October 31, 2020, there was $82.5 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards. See Note 9. Stock Plans of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

We estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. The use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value. The expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are

If our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2020 would have increased by approximately $8.08. To determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company's stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. If our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2020 would have increased by approximately $2.37.

Retirement Income Plan Soft Freeze

On June 18, 2019 the Board of Directors of the Company approved a soft freeze of the Plan effective August 1, 2019. The Plan was closed to employees hired on or after August 1, 2019, including former participants or employees rehired on or after August 1, 2019 and employees hired in connection with a stock or asset acquisition, merger or other similar transaction on or after August 1, 2019. Existing employees already covered by the Plan, continue to accrue their benefits. There is no material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the fiscal 2020 and 2019.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On March 18, 2019, the Company received stockholder approval for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The first offering period began on November 4, 2019 and offerings are generally made on a quarterly basis. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees of the Company with the opportunity to acquire shares of common stock at 

85%

 of the market price on the last business day of each offering period by means of accumulated payroll deductions. Payroll deductions will be limited to 

15%

 of the employee’s eligible compensation, not to exceed 

$21.3 thousand

 in any one calendar year. The ESPP initially authorized the issuance of 

1,000,000

 shares of common stock. These shares will be made available from shares of common stock reacquired by the Company as Treasury Stock. During fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, we issued 

11,641

 shares to our employees under the ESPP. At October 31, 2020, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under the ESPP is 988,359 shares. Total ESPP Share-based compensation recognized during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 was 

$0.7 million

Working Capital

The increase in working capital at October 31, 2020 from the end of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to: 

•

decrease in short-term debt of $

154.4

 million primarily due to repayment of the outstanding balance of the 2019 Term Loan at maturity net of the amount of borrowings received under the new 2020 Term Loan Agreement, entered into on October 16, 2020 (see below)

•

increase in inventories of $

63.5

 million due to lower sales from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher manufacturing costs

•

increase in cash and cash equivalents of $

26.9

 million

•

decrease in other current liabilities of $

25.3

 million primarily due to timing of payments and a reduction in fiscal 2020 customer rebate accruals due to the decrease in sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic

•

increase in prepaid expense and other current assets of $

20.3

 million, partially offset by;

•

increase in accounts payable of $

25.9

 million due to timing of payments

•

increase in employee compensation and benefits of $

14.3

 million

•

recognition of current operating lease liabilities of $

33.3

 million on adoption of ASC 842, Leases.

At October 31, 2020, our inventory months on hand were 6.6 compared to 6.4 at October 31, 2019. The $

63.5

 million increase in inventories was primarily due to lower sales from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher manufacturing costs.

Our days sales outstanding (DSO) was 60 days at October 31, 2020 compared to 56 days at October 31, 2019. The increase in DSO from October 31, 2019 to October 31, 2020 was primarily due to timing of collections.

Operating Cash Flow

Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $

226.6

 million from $

713.2

 million in fiscal 2019 to $

486.6

 million in fiscal 2020. This decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities primarily consists of:

•

decrease in net income of $

228.3

 million from a net income of $

466.7

 million in fiscal 2019 to $

238.4

 million in fiscal 2020 which resulted from a decrease in our net sales and additional expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic;

•

$

80.9

 million decrease in the net changes in prepayments and other assets primarily due to the refund of the prepayment made to the U.K. Tax Authorities in the prior year period and capitalized cloud computing costs;

•

$

95.5

 million cash outflow in fiscal 2020 compared to $

351.4

 million cash outflow in fiscal 2019, primarily due to:

•

$

 million increase in proceeds from long-term debt, primarily due to funds received from the 2020 Credit Agreement (as defined below) partially offset by;

•

$

1,374.1

•

$

531.9

 million decrease in net proceeds from short-term debt, primarily due to movements in short term loans.

On April 1, 2020, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (the 2020 Credit Agreement), among the Company and KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent. The 2020 Credit Agreement provides for (a) a multicurrency revolving credit facility (the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.29 billion and (b) a term loan facility (the 2020 Term Loan Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million, each of which, unless terminated earlier, mature on April 1, 2025. In addition, the Company has the ability from time to time to request an increase to the size of the revolving credit facility or establish one or more new term loans under the term loan facility in an aggregate amount up to $1.605 billion, subject to the discretionary participation of the lenders. 

On April 1, 2020, in connection with the Company’s entry into the 2020 Credit Agreement, the Company terminated the senior unsecured term loan agreement entered into on November 1, 2017 in connection with PARAGARD (the 2017 Term Loan Agreement) and the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement entered into on March 1, 2016 (the 2016 Credit Agreement). In connection with the termination, all borrowings outstanding under the 2017 Term Loan Agreement and the 2016 Credit Agreement were repaid.

At maturity, on September 25, 2020, outstanding amounts under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement (including the Second Amendment to the 2018 Term Loan Agreement) were fully repaid using borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility.

On October 16, 2020, the Company entered into a

72

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Interest Coverage Ratio. As defined, in the 2020 Credit Agreement and the 2019 Term Loan Agreement, we are required to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.00 to 1.00, and a Total Leverage Ratio of no higher than 3.75 to 1.00. At 

October 31, 2020

, we were in compliance with the Interest Coverage Ratio at 21.19 to 1.00 and the Total Leverage Ratio at 2.15 to 1.00. The Company, after considering the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, expects to remain in compliance with its financial maintenance covenant and meet its debt service obligations for at least the twelve months following the date of issuance of these financial statements.

See Note 5. Debt of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Considering recent market conditions and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have re-evaluated our operating cash flows and cash requirements and continue to believe that current cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operating activities and cash available under our 2020 Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as that for acquisitions, share repurchases, cash dividends or other activities as we execute our business strategy, we anticipate that additional funds will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

Share Repurchases

In December 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the 2012 Share Repurchase Program and through subsequent amendments, the most recent in March 2017, the total repurchase authorization was increased from 

$500.0 million

 to 

$1.0 billion

 of the Company's common stock. The program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Purchases under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program are subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and may be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.

As of October 31, 2020, we had $124.0 million of income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 Act, which is payable in six annual installments. The installment for 2021 is classified as a current income tax payable on our consolidated balance sheet. 

We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, about $58.5 million of our long-term income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above. However, other long-term liabilities, included in our consolidated balance sheet, include a reserve for a portion of these uncertain tax positions. See Note 6. Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes obligations for inventory, capital expenditures and other operating expense commitments.

Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years. 

Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP financial measures that may be included in this MD&A and the reasons management believes they are useful to investors are described below. These measures should be considered supplemental in nature and are not intended to be a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures may not be the same as similarly named measures presented by other companies.

Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow is useful for investors as an additional measure of liquidity because it represents 

74

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

cash that is available to grow the business, make strategic acquisitions, repay debt, buyback common stock or fund the dividend. We use free cash flow internally to understand, manage, make operating decisions and evaluate our business. In addition, we use free cash flow to help plan and forecast future periods.

Constant currency is defined as excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In order to assist with the assessment of how our underlying businesses performed, we compare the percentage change in net sales from one period to another, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present this information, current period revenue for entities reporting in currencies other than the United States dollar are converted into United States dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year.

Accounting Pronouncements 

Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1. Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies

 

Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods.

The World Health Organization categorized the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis, along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties, which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally. As a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic, governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the COVID-19 virus, many optical practitioners and retailers, hospitals, medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities, restricted access, or delayed or canceled patient visits, exams and elective medical procedures, and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits. This has had, and we believe will continue to have, an adverse effect on our sales, operating results and cash flows.

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates particularly as it relates to estimates reliant on forecasts and other assumptions impacted by uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our accounting estimates will depend on future developments including, but not limited to, the continued spread, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the occurrence, spread, duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks; the actions taken by the U.S. and foreign governments to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity; the occurrence, duration and severity of a global, regional or national recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event; the impact of the developments described above on our customers and suppliers; and how 

75

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to:

•

allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses

•

carrying value of inventory

•

carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets

There was not a material impact to the above estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continually monitor and evaluates the estimates used as additional information becomes available. Adjustments will be made to these provisions periodically to reflect new facts and circumstances that may indicate that historical experience may not be indicative of current and/or future results. Our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material changes to the estimates and material impacts to our Consolidated Financial Statements in future reporting periods.

Our critical accounting policies include:

•

Revenue recognition - We recognize revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers and/or when services are rendered. Our payment terms are typically between 30 to 120 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. 

Product discounts, including certain rebates, sales incentives, and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer. We evaluate contractual terms, historical experience, and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized. Our PARAGARD program is subject to Medicaid rebates, which are estimated at the time of sale based upon the difference between current retail pricing and contractual Medicaid pricing and an estimate of the number of units that will be sold to Medicaid patients, which is informed by historical trends of claim history.

Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data. Promotional programs, such as cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. We currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.

•

Valuation of goodwill - We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. We account for goodwill, evaluate and test goodwill balances for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards. We performed an annual impairment assessment in our third quarter of fiscal 

2020

 and 

2019

, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill in our reporting units. We test goodwill impairment in accordance with ASU 2017-04, 

Intangibles - Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

. We perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be 

76

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

recognized for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment.

Goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, we may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets and stockholders' equity.

•

Leases - We consider an arrangement a lease if the arrangement transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. We have operating leases, but do not have material financing leases. Lease right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make payments arising from the lease agreement. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease based upon the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term reflects the noncancelable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option. Changes in the lease term assumption could impact the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized on the balance sheet. As our leases typically do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate, we determine the present value of the lease liability using our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date based on the lease term on a collateralized basis.

•

Business combinations - We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. We recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. Key assumptions routinely utilized in allocation of purchase price to intangible assets include projected financial information such as revenue projections for companies acquired. As of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

•

Income taxes - We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the tax rate, we use the full-year income and the related income tax

expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material.

We file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns that we have determined are not more-likely-than-not realizable. Our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. These tax reserves have been established based on management's assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to our uncertain tax positions as well as interest and penalties attributable to these uncertain tax positions. All tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that result in changes in judgment.
