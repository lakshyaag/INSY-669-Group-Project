FORW

ARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE

 

Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).  A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements.  Forward-looking statements may contain words like: “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “shall,” “will” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance.  In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings.  We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA. 

 

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: 

 



The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future outbreaks of COVID-19, and uncertainty surrounding the length and severity of future impacts on the global economy and on our business, results of operations and financial condition;



Further deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels and claims experience; 



Adverse global capital and credit market conditions that may affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures; 



The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts, which could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;



Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect: the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products; the required amount of reserves and/or surplus; our ability to conduct business and our captive reinsurance arrangements as well as restrictions on the payment of revenue sharing and 12b-1 distribution fees;



The impact of U.S. federal tax reform legislation on our business, earnings and capital; 



The impact of Regulation Best Interest or other regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Labor or other federal or state regulators or self-regulatory organizations relating to the standard of care owed by investment advisers and/or broker-dealers that could affect our distribution model;  



Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;



Further declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products; 



Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;



The impact of the implementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to the regulation of derivatives transactions;



The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as:  adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;



A decline or continued volatility in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products; a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products; an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”); and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;



Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;



Future pandemics, acts of terrorism, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;



Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;



The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from evolving market preferences and the changing demographics of our client base; and



The unanticipated loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.

 

The risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this report and other reports that we file with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance, including “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which are incorporated herein by reference.  Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment.  New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. 

 

Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.

RODUCTION

 

Exe

cutive Summary 

 

We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies.  We sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation, retirement income and group protection products and solutions through our four business segments: 

 



Annuities;



Retirement Plan Services;



Life Insurance; and



Group Protection 

 

We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  See “Part I – Item 1. Business” above for a discussion of our business segments and products. 

 

As discussed in Note 3, on May 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company of 100% of the capital stock of Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston (“Liberty Life”), an operator of a group benefits business (the “Liberty Group Business”) and an individual life and individual and group annuity business.  We ceded insurance policies relating to the individual life and individual and group annuity business to third-party reinsurers.  The acquisition expanded the scale and capabilities of the Group Protection business while further diversifying the Company’s sources of earnings.  Effective September 1, 2019, Liberty Life’s name was changed to Lincoln Life Assurance Company of Boston (“LLACB”).

In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments.  Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments.  Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 22.  Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses.  Certain items are excluded from operating revenue and income (loss) from operations because they are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.  In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our businesses.

 

We provide information about our segments’ and Other Operations’ operating revenue and expense line items and realized gain (loss), key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items below.  For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.  

 

Industry Trends

 

We continue to be influenced by a variety of trends that affect the industry. 

 

COVID-19 Pandemic

 

The COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the United States in the first quarter of 2020 and led to an extreme downturn in and volatility of the capital markets, record-low interest rates and wide-ranging changes in consumer behavior, including as a result of quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activity.  The severe restriction in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased level of unemployment in the United States have contributed to increased volatility and uncertainty regarding expectations for the economy and markets going forward.  The National Bureau of Economic Research, a panel of economists charged with officially designating business cycles, announced in June 2020 that a recession began in March 2020, ending the longest expansion period in United States history.  Although states have eased restrictions and the capital markets have mostly recovered, it is unclear when the economy will operate under normal or near-normal conditions.  In the third quarter, the economy began to recover from what has been deemed the shortest recession on record in the United States.  However, as the economic and regulatory environment continues to react and evolve, we cannot predict the full impact of the pandemic and ensuing conditions on our business and financial condition.

 

As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to expect higher mortality in our Life Insurance and Group Protection segments in 2021.  Separately, we continue to expect increased disability claims in our Group Protection segment related to the economic environment and the increased level of unemployment in the United States.

 

Economic Environment 

 

Because the profitability of some of our business depends in part on interest rates, changes in interest rates may impact both our margins and our return on invested capital.  Some of our products, principally our fixed annuities and universal life insurance (“UL”), including indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”) and linked-benefit UL, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates or prolonged low interest rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the interest that we are required to credit to contracts and the yields that we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting our obligations under the contracts.  

 

In response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero in March 2020 and announced in September 2020 its intention to keep interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future.  We expect the continuation of the low interest rate environment to continue to adversely affect the interest margins of our businesses.  For risks related to sustained low interest rates, see “Significant Operational Matters – Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment” below and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.”

 

The economic environment has improved from early in 2020 but there could be continued weakness in the current environment as a result of restrictions on economic activity and the increased level of unemployment in the United States.  This could impact select corporate industries and parts of the commercial mortgage loan market.  The current environment could lead to increased credit defaults and/or negative ratings migrations, resulting in an increase to our allowance for credit losses and additional write-downs of financial assets for impairments in our broader investment portfolio.

Regulatory Environment

 

U.S.-domiciled insurance entities are regulated at the state level, while certain products and services are also subject to federal regulation.  Regulators may refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry.  Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially affect the capital requirements and profitability of the industry and result in increased regulation and oversight for the industry.  See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax” for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.

 

Significant Operational Matters 

 

Actions in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic

 

We took several actions during 2020, and expect to continue to take actions, to preserve our liquidity and capital position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic environment conditions.  During the second and third quarters of 2020, we suspended common stock repurchases under our buyback program after repurchasing $225 million of shares in the first quarter of 2020.  We resumed common stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2020, repurchasing $50 million of shares.

 

Debt financing transactions in the first half of 2020 allowed us to redeem our 2021 and prefund our 2022 senior debt maturities, with our next debt maturity not until 2023.  

 

While the COVID-19 pandemic caused distribution disruption, we efficiently moved to a virtual sales environment across all of our distribution channels beginning in mid-March 2020.  In addition, during 2020, we accelerated a plan already in place, in light of the low interest rate environment, to re-price certain products to achieve appropriate returns, shift our sales mix toward shorter-duration products that are less sensitive to interest rates, and add new products that are more capital efficient while increasing consumer choice and expanding customer value propositions.  

 

We also continue to focus on expense discipline.  During the second quarter of 2020, we implemented a plan that significantly reduced expenses in 2020, and we expect to continue to manage expenses aggressively going forward. 

 

Targeted Annual Operating Earnings Per Share Growth

 

Growth in operating earnings per share (“EPS”) is a key driver of our long-term performance.  We believe that the key drivers to growing our operating EPS over time include:

 



Generating new business and positive net flows through our product development and distribution;



Capital markets performing in-line with our expectations;



Expense discipline, our strategic digitization initiative and expense synergies of acquired businesses driving improvement in operating margins; and



Capital generation and active capital deployment, consisting of returning capital to common stockholders.

Sources of Earnings

 

We monitor our sources of earnings as a factor in managing our businesses.  This information may be useful in assessing our risk profile and cost of capital.  We continue to focus on achieving our long-term goal of increasing mortality and morbidity margins.  Growth in this source of earnings component could be driven by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, pricing actions on our life and group products and acquiring blocks of mortality/morbidity business.  The following table presents the sources of earnings components of income (loss) from operations, before income taxes, excluding Other Operations:

(1)

Investment spread earnings consist primarily of net investment income, net of interest credited, earned on the underlying general account investments supporting our fixed products less related expenses.

(2)

Mortality/morbidity earnings result from mortality margins, morbidity margins, and certain expense assessments and related fees that are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of business in force. 

(3)

Fees on assets under management (“AUM”) earnings consist primarily of asset-based fees charged on variable account values less associated benefits and related expenses. 

(4)

Variable annuity (“VA”) riders’ earnings consist of fees charged to the contract holder related to guaranteed benefit rider features, less the net valuation premium and associated change in benefit reserves and related expenses.

(5)

The sources of earnings components include the effect of unlocking resulting from our annual comprehensive review, which for 2020 and 2019 were significantly unfavorable.  See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” below for more information about unlocking.

 

See Note 22 for additional information on income (loss) from operations by segment. 

 

Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment 

 

Although we have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment, declines in our spread, or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products, could have an adverse effect on some of our businesses or results of operations.  We have provided disclosures around interest rate spreads and interest rate risk in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”

 

Variable Annuity Hedge Program Performance

 

We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees.  As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB,” we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) embedded derivatives and benefit ratio unlocking in certain of our variable annuity products.  The income statement effect due to the change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in embedded derivative reserves and benefit ratio unlocking.  These results are excluded from the Annuities and Retirement Plan Services  segments’ operating revenues and income (loss) from operations (see Note 22).  See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below for information on our methodology for calculating the non-performance risk (“NPR”), which affects the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserves.

 

We also offer variable annuity products with death benefit guarantees.  As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – GDB,” we use derivative instruments to hedge the income statement effect of the guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) benefit ratio unlocking for movements in equity markets.  These results are excluded from income (loss) from operations (see Note 22).

 

The costs of derivative instruments that we use to hedge these variable annuity products may increase as a result of a low interest rate environment.

Earnings from Account Values

 

The Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments are the most sensitive to the equity markets, as well as, to a lesser extent, our Life Insurance segment.  We discuss the earnings effect of the equity markets on account values and the related asset-based earnings below in each business segment’s operating results section and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity.”  

 

Strategic Digitization Initiative 

 

We continue to make strategic investments in our businesses to grow revenues, further spur productivity and improve our efficiency and service to our customers.  In 2016, we began our enterprise-wide digitization initiative that intends to significantly enhance our customer experience and provide operational efficiencies over time to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts.  During 2020, we saw benefits of approximately $50 million, pre-tax, net of investment.  We expect to see annual benefits of $80 million, pre-tax, net of investment, in 2021, and ultimately $90 million to $150 million as a result of this initiative. 

 

Outlook

 

Management expects to continue focusing on the following in 2021:

 



Making investments in our businesses, primarily in technology/digitization (including integrating and consolidating systems and processes), product innovation and distribution, to grow revenues, drive margin expansion and reduce costs; 



Re-pricing products to ensure we are achieving the necessary return on capital;



Focusing a large majority of our new business mix on products without long-term guarantees, which are less sensitive to interest rates, in line with our long-term growth strategies;



Adding new products that are more capital efficient while increasing consumer choice and expanding customer value propositions; 



Focusing on expense discipline and managing our expenses aggressively;



Closely monitoring our capital and liquidity positions taking into account changing economic conditions and monetary policy, ongoing regulatory activities and our capital deployment strategy;



Closely monitoring ongoing activities in the legal and regulatory environment and taking an active role in the legislative and/or regulatory process; 



Exploring additional reinsurance and other strategies addressing the statutory reserve strain related to certain products, namely our term products; and



Maintaining risk management and the flexibility to adjust the risk profile of assets within our investment portfolio.

 

Critical 

Accounting

 Policies and Estimates

 

We have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the understanding of our results of operations and our financial condition.  In applying these critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements, management must use critical assumptions, estimates and judgments concerning future results or other developments, including the likelihood, timing or amount of one or more future events.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our assumptions, estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  For a detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies, see Note 1.

 

DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL

 

Accounting for intangible assets requires numerous assumptions, such as estimates of expected future profitability for our operations and our ability to retain existing blocks of life and annuity business in force.  Our accounting policies for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL affect the Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments.  

 

Deferrals

 

Qualifying deferrable acquisition expenses are recorded as an asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as DAC for products we sold during a period or VOBA for books of business we acquired during a period.  In addition, we defer costs associated with DSI and revenues associated with DFEL.  DSI increases interest credited and reduces income when amortized.  DFEL is a liability included within other contract holder funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and when amortized, increases fee income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Table of Contents

 




 

We incur certain costs that can be capitalized in the acquisition of insurance contracts.  Only those costs incurred that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts may be capitalized as deferrable acquisition costs.  This determination of deferability must be made on a contract-level basis.  Some examples of acquisition costs that are subject to deferral include the following:

 



Employee, agent or broker commissions;



Wholesaler production bonuses;



Renewal commissions and bonuses to agents or brokers;



Medical and inspection fees; 



Premium-related taxes and assessments; and



A portion of the salaries and benefits of certain employees involved in the underwriting, contract issuance and processing, medical and inspection and sales force contract selling functions.

 

All other acquisition-related costs, including costs incurred by the insurer for soliciting potential customers, market research, training, administration, management of distribution and underwriting functions, unsuccessful acquisition or renewal efforts and product development, are considered non-deferrable acquisition costs and must be expensed in the period incurred.  

 

In addition, the following indirect costs are considered non-deferrable acquisition costs and must be charged to expense in the period incurred:  

 



Administrative costs;



Rent;



Depreciation;



Occupancy costs;



Equipment costs (including data processing equipment dedicated to acquiring insurance contracts);



Trail commissions; and



Other general overhead.

Amortization

 

DAC for variable annuity and deferred fixed annuity contracts and UL and variable universal life insurance (“VUL”) policies is amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to the incidence of EGPs derived from the contracts.  Certain broker commissions or broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales of mutual fund products, respectively, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.  For our traditional products, we amortize deferrable acquisition costs either on a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.  

 

EGPs vary based on a number of sources including policy persistency, mortality, fee income, investment margins, expense margins and realized gains and losses on investments, including assumptions about the expected level of credit-related losses.  Each of these sources of profit is, in turn, driven by other factors.  For example, assets under management and the spread between earned and credited rates drive investment margins; net amount at risk drives the level of cost of insurance charges and reinsurance premiums.  The level of separate account assets under management is driven by changes in the financial markets (equity and bond markets, hereafter referred to collectively as “equity markets”) and net flows.  Realized gains and losses on investments include amounts resulting from differences in the actual level of impairments and the levels assumed in calculating EGPs.

 

We generally amortize DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL in proportion to our EGPs for interest-sensitive products.  When actual gross profits are higher in the period than EGPs, we recognize more amortization than planned.  When actual gross profits are lower in the period than EGPs, we recognize less amortization than planned.  In a calendar year where the gross profits for a certain group of policies, or “cohorts,” are negative, our actuarial process limits, or floors, the amortization expense offset to zero.  For a discussion of the periods over which we amortize our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL see “DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in Note 1.

 

Unlocking

 

As discussed and defined in “DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in Note 1, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products in the third quarter of each year.  We may have unlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating assumptions outside of our annual comprehensive review. 

 

For illustrative purposes, the following generally presents the hypothetical effects to net income (loss) attributable to changes in certain assumptions from those our model projections assume, assuming all other factors remain constant:

Unlocking was driven primarily by the following:

 

2020

 

As part of our annual comprehensive review in the third quarter, we

 

updated our interest rate assumptions.  These updates included lowering starting new money rates to reflect the current interest rate environment and reducing our long-term new money investment yield assumption by 50 basis points, resulting in an ultimate long-term assumption of 3.0% for a 10-year U.S. Treasury.  As a result of these updates, we recorded unfavorable after-tax unlocking of $361 million for Life Insurance, $140 million for Annuities and $7 million for Retirement Plan Services.  

 



For Annuities, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to interest rate assumptions, partially offset by favorable updates to policyholder behavior assumptions and other items.



For Retirement Plan Services, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to interest rate assumptions, partially offset by favorable updates to maintenance expense and other items.



For Life Insurance, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to interest rate and policyholder behavior assumptions.



For excluded realized gain (loss), favorable unlocking was driven by updates to policyholder behavior and separate account fee assumptions,

 

partially offset by unfavorable updates to other items.

 

2019

 

As part of our annual comprehensive review in the third quarter, we

 

updated our interest rate assumptions.  These updates included lowering starting new money rates to reflect the current interest rate environment; reducing our long-term new money investment yield assumption by 25 basis points, resulting in an ultimate long-term assumption of 3.5% for a 10-year U.S. Treasury; and extending the grade-in period from current rates to long-term rates from five years to seven years.  As a result of these updates, we recorded unfavorable after-tax unlocking of $225 million for Life Insurance, $63 million for Annuities and $3 million for Retirement Plan Services.

 



For Annuities, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to interest rate assumptions and other items

,

 partially offset by favorable updates to separate account fee and policyholder behavior assumptions.



For Retirement Plan Services, unfavorable unlocking impact from updates to interest rate assumptions was entirely offset by favorable updates to separate account fee, maintenance expense and policyholder behavior assumptions.



For Life Insurance, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to mortality margin, interest rate and reinsurance assumptions, partially offset by favorable updates to investment allocation and reserve discount rate assumptions and other items.



For excluded realized gain (loss), favorable unlocking was driven by updates to capital markets, separate account fee and policyholder behavior assumptions,

 

partially offset by unfavorable updates to other items.

 

Reversion to the Mean

 

Because returns within the variable sub-accounts (“variable funds”) have a significant effect on the value of variable annuity and VUL products and the fees earned on these accounts, EGPs could increase or decrease with movements in variable fund returns.  Significant and sustained changes in variable funds have had and could in the future have an effect on DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization primarily within our Annuities and RPS segments, as well as, to a lesser extent, our Life Insurance segment. 

 

As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process.  Under our RTM process, future EGPs are projected using stochastic modeling of a large number of market scenarios in conjunction with best estimates of lapse rates, interest rate spreads and mortality to develop a statistical distribution of the present value of future EGPs for our variable annuity products.  Because variable fund returns are unpredictable, the underlying premise of this process is that best estimate projections of future EGPs need not be affected by random short-term and insignificant deviations from expectations in variable fund returns.  However, long-term or significant deviations from expected variable fund returns require a change to best estimate projections of EGPs and unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and

Table of Contents

 




changes in future contract benefits.  The statistical distribution is designed to identify when the deviations from expected returns have become significant enough to warrant a change of the future variable fund growth rate assumption.  

 

As discussed above, stochastic modeling is used to develop a range of reasonably possible future EGPs.  We compare the range of the present value of the future EGPs from the stochastic modeling to that used in our amortization model.  A set of intervals around the mean of these scenarios is utilized to calculate two separate statistical ranges of reasonably possible EGPs.  These intervals are then compared to the present value of the EGPs used in the amortization model.  If the present value of EGPs utilized for amortization were to exceed the reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision of the EGPs used to calculate amortization would be considered.  If a revision is deemed necessary, future EGPs would be re-projected using the current account values at the end of the period during which the revision occurred along with a long-term variable fund growth rate assumption such that the re-projected EGPs would be our best estimate of EGPs.

 

Our practice is not necessarily to unlock immediately after exceeding the first of the two statistical ranges, but, rather, if we stay between the first and second statistical range for several quarters, we would likely unlock.  Additionally, if we exceed the ranges as a result of a short-term market reaction, we would not necessarily unlock.  However, if the second statistical range is exceeded for more than one quarter, it is likely that we would unlock.  While this approach reduces adjustments to DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL due to short-term fluctuations, significant changes in variable fund returns that extend beyond one or two quarters could result in a significant favorable or unfavorable unlocking.  Notwithstanding these intervals, if a severe decline or increase in variable fund values were to occur or should other circumstances suggest that the present value of future EGPs no longer represents our best estimate, we could determine that a revision of the EGPs is necessary.

 

Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate decrease of approximately 13% followed by growth going forward of 6.5% to 8.25% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed-income and equity-type investments.  If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of December 31, 2020, we would have recorded favorable unlocking of approximately $365 million, pre-tax, primarily within our Annuities segment.

 

Investments

 

Investments are an integral part of our operations, and we invest in fixed maturity securities that are primarily classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value with the difference from amortized cost due to factors other than credit loss included in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI.  The difference between amortized cost and fair value due to credit loss impairment is recognized in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  We also invest in equity securities that are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in realized gain (loss).  See “Consolidated Investments” below for more information.  

 

Investment Valuation 

 

Our measurement of fair value is based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset or NPR, which would include our own credit risk.  Our estimate of an exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability (“exit price”) in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or liability, as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or receive a liability (“entry price”).  We categorize our financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of inputs to the respective valuation technique.  The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined in Note 1.

Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value. 

 

For the categories and associated fair value of our fixed maturity AFS securities classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, see Notes 1 and 21. 

 

Our investments are valued using the appropriate market inputs based on the investment type, and include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.  In addition, market indicators and industry and economic events are monitored, and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met.  We incorporate the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if warranted, given the issuer’s industry and the security’s time to maturity.  We use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we do not adjust prices received from third parties or obtain multiple prices when measuring the fair value of our investments.  We generally use prices from the pricing service rather than broker quotes because we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs they use, as compared to the limited information on the pricing inputs from broker quotes.  For private placement securities, we use pricing matrices that utilize observable pricing inputs of similar public securities and Treasury yields as inputs to the fair value measurement.  

It is possible that different valuation techniques and models, other than those described above, could produce materially different estimates of fair value.

 

 

When the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability, we believe that the market is not active.  Activities that may indicate a market is not active include fewer recent transactions in the market, price quotations that lack current information and/or vary substantially over time or among market makers, limited public information, uncorrelated indexes with recent fair values of assets and abnormally wide bid-ask spread.  As of December 31, 2020, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive.  We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions.

 

We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information.  

We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation.  For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants.  Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant.  

Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of December 31, 2020

, we used broker quotes for 94 securities as our final price source, representing 1% of total securities owned. 

 

In order to validate the pricing information and broker quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent sales and observations of general market movements for those security classes.  Our primary third-party pricing service has policies and processes to ensure that it is using objectively verifiable observable market data.  The pricing service regularly reviews the evaluation inputs for securities covered, including broker quotes, executed trades and credit information, as applicable.  If the pricing service determines it does not have sufficient objectively verifiable information about a security’s valuation, it discontinues providing a valuation for the security.  The pricing service regularly publishes and updates a summary of inputs used in its valuations by major security type.  In addition, we have policies and procedures in place to review the process that is utilized by the third-party pricing service and the output that is provided to us by the pricing service.  On a periodic basis, we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used by the pricing service, and we perform a comparison of the pricing service output to an alternative pricing source.  In addition, we check prices provided by our primary pricing service to ensure that they are not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the prices for unusual changes from period to period based on certain parameters or for lack of change from one period to the next.  If such anomalies in the pricing are observed, we may use pricing information from another pricing source.

Valuation of Alternative Investments

 

Recognition of investment income on alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial statements, which are generally obtained from the partnerships’ general partners, as our venture capital, real estate and oil and gas portfolios are generally reported to us on a three-month delay, and our hedge funds are reported to us on a one-month delay.  In addition, the effect of annual audit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of the investees are typically received during the first or second quarter of each calendar year.  Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar year period may not include the complete effect of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar year period.  Recorded audit adjustments affect our investment income on alternative investments in the period that the adjustments are recorded.  

 

Measurement of Allowances for Credit Losses and Recognition of Impairments

 

As of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”)

,

 which replaced the historical incurred credit loss methodology with an expected credit loss methodology and impacts the way we recognize and measure impairment.  See Note 2 for additional information.

 

We regularly review our fixed maturity AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be impairment-related.  Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience.  In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are related to credit losses, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value.  However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance.  Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses attributable to factors other than credit loss until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell.  These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS.  We expect to continue to manage all non-trading investments within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification. 

 

We consider economic factors and circumstances within industries and countries where recent impairments have occurred in our assessment of the position of securities we own of similarly situated issuers.  While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio.  Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks.  The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.  When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is due to credit loss, a credit loss allowance is recorded.  In instances where declines are related to factors other than credit loss, the security will continue to be carefully monitored.  

 

There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether an investment shows indications of impairment.  These include subsequent significant changes in general overall economic conditions, as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, future financial market effects such as interest rate spreads, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments.  In addition, there are often significant estimates and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair values of securities as described in “Investment Valuation” above.  We continually monitor developments and update underlying assumptions and financial models based upon new information. 

 

For certain securitized fixed maturity AFS securities with contractual cash flows, including asset-backed securities (“ABS”), we use our best estimate of cash flows for the life of the security to determine whether it is credit impaired.  In addition, we review for other indicators of impairment as required by the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 

Accounting Standards Codification

TM

 (“ASC”).

 

Write-downs on real estate and other investments are experienced when the estimated value of the asset is deemed to be less than the carrying value.  Write-downs and allowance for credit losses for commercial mortgage loans are established when the estimated value of the asset is deemed to be less than the carrying value.  All commercial mortgage loans that are impaired are individually reviewed to determine an appropriate credit loss allowance.  Changing economic conditions affect our valuation of commercial mortgage loans.  Increasing vacancies, declining rents and the like are incorporated into the allowance for credit losses analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to an increase in the allowance for credit losses.  In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify both current and projected future risk based on reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Areas of emphasis include properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt-service coverage and/or loan-to-value reduction.  Where warranted, we have established or increased our allowance for credit losses based upon this analysis.

 

We have also established an allowance for credit losses on our residential mortgage loan portfolio that includes a specific credit loss allowance for loans that are deemed to be impaired as well as an allowance for credit losses for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.  The allowance for credit losses for the performing population of loans is based on historical performance for similar loans, as well as projected future losses based on modeling, which includes reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The historical data utilized in the allowance for credit losses calculation process is adjusted for current economic conditions.

Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses.  When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses.  These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. 

 

Derivatives 

 

We maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk, basis risk and credit risk.  Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates.  Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” Notes 1 and 6. 

 

We carry our derivative instruments at fair value, which we determine through valuation techniques or models that use market data inputs or independent broker quotations.  The fair values fluctuate from period to period due to the volatility of the valuation inputs, including but not limited to swap interest rates, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads and correlations, some of which are significantly affected by economic conditions.  The effect to revenue is reported in realized gain (loss) and such amount along with the associated federal income taxes is excluded from income (loss) from operations of our segments.  

 

Certain of our variable annuity contracts reported within future contract benefits contain embedded derivatives that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are all classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, including our GLB reserves embedded derivatives, a portion of which may be reported in either other assets or other liabilities.  These embedded derivatives are valued based on a stochastic projection of scenarios of the embedded derivative cash flows.  The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include assumptions for capital markets, actuarial lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, risk margin, administrative expenses and a margin for profit.  In addition, an NPR component is determined at each valuation date that reflects our risk of not fulfilling the obligations of the underlying liability.  The spread for the NPR is added to the discount rates used in determining the fair value from the net cash flows.  We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions.  It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.  Changes in the fair value of these embedded derivatives result primarily from changes in market conditions.  For more information, see Notes 1 and 21.

 

GLB

 

We have a dynamic hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities associated with the guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) and guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features that are available in our variable annuity products.  We have certain GLB variable annuity products with GWB and GIB features that are embedded derivatives.  Certain features of these guarantees have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC (“benefit reserves”) and embedded derivative reserves.  We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature.  In addition to mitigating selected risk and income statement volatility, the hedge program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits.

 

Changes in the value of the hedge contracts hedge the income statement effect of changes in GLB embedded derivative reserves and benefit reserves.  This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options and total return swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, and futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices, as well as interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency futures.  The notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and GLB benefit reserves caused by changes in equity markets, as well as the change in GLB embedded derivative reserves caused by changes in interest rates and implied volatilities.  See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below for information on how we determine our NPR.

 

As part of our current hedging program, equity market, interest rate and market-implied volatility conditions are monitored on a daily basis.  We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed.  While we actively manage our hedge positions, these positions may not completely offset changes in the fair value of embedded derivative reserves and benefit reserves caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities, realized market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off.

Within our individual annuity business, 59% and 63% of our variable annuity account values contained GLB features as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Underperforming equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features.  A contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 10% of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $582 million and $598 million, respectively.  However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount.  If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments.  The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.

 

As a result of these factors, the ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GLB guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $582 million, net of reinsurance.  Our fair value estimates of the GLB embedded derivatives, which are based on detailed models of future cash flows under a wide range of market-consistent scenarios, reflect a more comprehensive view of the related factors and represent our best estimate of the present value of these potential liabilities.  The market-consistent scenarios used in the determination of the fair value of the GLB embedded derivatives are similar to those used by an investment bank to value derivatives for which the pricing is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid.  We use risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulations in our calculation to value the entire block of guarantees, which involve 100 unique scenarios per policy or approximately 47 million scenarios.  The market-consistent scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant.  The market-consistent inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions for capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, rider utilization, etc.), mortality, risk margins, maintenance expenses and a margin for profit.  We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions.  It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.  For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below. 

 

The following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income (loss) that could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities (in millions) at the levels indicated in the table and excludes the net cost of operating the hedging program.  The amounts represent the estimated difference between the change in the portion of GLB reserves that is calculated on a fair value basis and the change in the value of the underlying hedge instruments after the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and taxes.  These effects do not include any estimate of unlocking that could occur, nor do they estimate any change in the NPR component of the GLB reserve or any estimate of effects to our GLB benefit ratio unlocking.  These estimates are based upon the recorded reserves as of December 31, 2020, and the related hedge instruments in place as of that date.  The effects presented in the table below are not representative of the aggregate impacts that could result if a combination of such changes to equity market returns, interest rates and implied volatilities occurred.

The actual effects of the results illustrated in the two tables above could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control, and consideration should be given to the following:

 



The analysis is only valid as of December 31, 2020, due to changing market conditions, contract holder activity, hedge positions and other factors;



The analysis assumes instantaneous shifts in the capital market factors and no ability to rebalance hedge positions prior to the market changes;



The analysis assumes constant exchange rates and implied dividend yields;



Assumptions regarding shifts in the market factors, such as assuming parallel shifts in interest rate and implied volatility term structures, may be overly simplistic and not indicative of actual market behavior in stress scenarios;



It is very unlikely that one capital market sector (e.g., equity markets) will sustain such a large instantaneous movement without affecting other capital market sectors; and



The analysis assumes that there is no tracking or basis risk between the funds and/or indices affecting the GLB reserves and the instruments utilized to hedge these exposures.

 

Index 

Benefits

 

Our indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect a fixed interest rate return or a return where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500® Index or other indices.  Contract holders may elect to rebalance among the various accounts within the product at renewal dates.  At the end of each indexed term, which can be up to six years, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by establishing different participation rates, caps, spreads or specified rates, subject to contractual guarantees.  We purchase and sell index options that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset period.  The mark-to-market of the options held generally offsets the change in value of the embedded derivative within the contract, both of which are recorded as a component of realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC require that we calculate fair values of index options we may purchase or sell in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations in future reset periods.  These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase or sell in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indicators of volatility and interest rates.  Changes in the fair values of these liabilities are included as a component of realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  For information on our index benefits hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below. 

 

Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations 

 

Reserves

 

Reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature.  Establishing adequate reserves for our obligations to contract holders requires assumptions to be made regarding mortality and morbidity.  The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding contracts.  These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation.

 

The reserves reported in our consolidated financial statements contained herein are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance subsidiaries.  These differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables, interest, persistency and other assumptions that we believe to be more representative of the expected experience for these contracts than those required for statutory accounting purposes and from differences in actuarial reserving methods.  

 




 

 

51

Table of Contents

 




 

The assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable.  If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses.  If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required.  This would result in a charge to our net income during the period the increase in reserves occurred.  The key experience assumptions include mortality rates, policy persistency and interest rates.  We periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.

 

GDB

 

The reserves related to the GDB features available in our variable annuity products are based on the application of a “benefit ratio” (the present value of total expected benefit payments over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract) to total variable annuity assessments received in the period.  The level and direction of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the benefit ratio and the level of assessments associated with the variable annuity.  

 

We utilize a delta hedging strategy for variable annuity products with a GDB feature, which uses futures and total return swaps on equity market indices to hedge against movements in equity markets.  The hedging strategy is designed to hedge our exposure to earnings volatility that results from equity market driven changes in the reserve for GDB contracts.  Because the GDB reserves are based upon projected long-term equity market return assumptions, and because the value of the hedging contracts will reflect current capital market conditions, the quarterly changes in values for the GDB reserves and the hedging contracts may not exactly offset each other.  For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below. 

 

UL Products with Secondary Guarantees

 

We issue UL contracts where we provide a secondary guarantee to the contract holder.  The policy can remain in force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met.  The reserves related to UL products with secondary guarantees are based on the application of a benefit ratio the same as our GDB features, which are discussed above.  The level and direction of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the benefit ratio and the level of assessments associated with the contracts.  For more discussion, see “Results of Life Insurance” below. 

 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

 

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  Intangibles that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  We perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test where the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, goodwill is impaired and written down to the reporting unit’s fair value.  The results of one test on one reporting unit cannot subsidize the results of another reporting unit.  For the purposes of the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill, our reporting units (Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life

Insurance and Group Protection) correspond with our reporting segments.

 

The fair values of our reporting units are comprised of the value of in-force (i.e., existing) business and the value of new business.  Specifically, new business is representative of cash flows and profitability associated with policies or contracts we expect to issue in the future, reflecting our forecasts of future sales volume and product mix over a 10-year period.  To determine the values of in-force and new business, we use a discounted cash flows technique that applies a discount rate reflecting the market expected, weighted-average rate of return adjusted for the risk factors associated with operations to the projected future cash flows for each reporting unit.

 

As of October 1, 2020 and 2019, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units, and, as of each such date, the fair value was in excess of each reporting unit’s carrying value for Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection.  

 

 




 

 

52

Table of Contents

 




 

We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units.  Factors that can influence the value of goodwill include the capital markets, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, consumer confidence and any items that can directly or indirectly affect new business future cash flows.  Factors that could affect production levels and profitability of new business include mix of new business, pricing changes, customer acceptance of our products and distribution strength.  Spread compression and related effects to profitability caused by lower interest rates affect the valuation of in-force business more significantly than the valuation of new business, as new business pricing assumptions reflect the current and anticipated future interest rate environment.  Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments.  Examples of unfavorable changes to assumptions or factors that could result in future impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:

 



Lower expectations for future sales levels or future sales profitability;



Higher discount rates on new business assumptions;



Weakened expectations for the ability to execute future reserve financing transactions for life insurance business over the long-term or expectations for significant increases in the associated costs;



Legislative, regulatory or tax changes that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserve requirements or changes to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements; and



Valuations of significant mergers or acquisitions of companies or blocks of business that would provide relevant market-based inputs for our impairment assessment that could support less favorable conclusions regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units.

 

Refer to Note 10 for goodwill and specifically identifiable intangible assets by segment.

 

Income Taxes 

 

Management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for items recognized differently in its financial statements from amounts shown on its income tax returns and the federal income tax expense.  Determining these amounts requires analysis and interpretation of current tax laws and regulations.  Management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets.  These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change.  Legislative changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, modifications or new regulations, administrative rulings, or court decisions could increase or decrease our effective tax rate.

 

The application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable.  Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance.  In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including:  the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused.  Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including our net operating loss deferred tax asset, will be realized.  For additional information on our income taxes, see Note 7.

Comparison of 2020 to 2019

 

Net income decreased due primarily to the following:

 



Higher benefits in our Life Insurance and Group Protection segments driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.



Spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates.



The effect of unlocking.



Lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.

 

The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:

 



Higher investment income on alternative investments.



Aggressively managing expenses, and lower incentive compensation as a result of production performance.



Lower acquisition and integration costs incurred associated with our 2018 acquisition.



Growth in average account values, business in force and group earned premiums.



Lower realized losses.

(3)

Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility and the net settlement related to a modified coinsurance (“Modco”) reinsurance transaction.

 

Comparison of 2020 to 2019

 

Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:

 



Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by higher average gross fixed account values and investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio.



Higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values.



Lower commissions and other expenses due to the effect of unlocking, expense management and incentive compensation as a result of production performance, partially offset by higher trail commissions resulting from higher average account values.

 

The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher benefits, net of changes in income annuity reserves, due to the effect of unlocking, an increase in the growth in benefit reserves driven primarily by equity market performance and an increase in costs associated with our hedge program.

 

See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for information about unlocking.

 

Additional Information

 

Strategic near-term actions to re-price certain products and to shift sales from fixed annuity products to respond to the low interest rate environment have contributed to lower deposits and negative net flows in 2020.  We expect the trend of negative net flows to persist into 2021.  For a discussion of the expected and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Introduction – Executive Summary” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.”

 

New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business.  Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations.




 

 

56

Table of Contents

 




 

The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business.  An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused by full surrenders, deaths and other contract benefits.  These outflows as a percentage of average gross account values were 7%, 9% and 9% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 

Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges.  Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.  We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.  For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” and “Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”

The account values of our variable annuity contracts are invested by our policyholders in a variety of investment options including, but not limited to, domestic and international equity securities and fixed income, which do not necessarily align with S&P 500 Index performance.  See Note 11 for additional information.

We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses.  These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values.  Average daily variable account values are driven by net flows and variable fund returns.  Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount.  We may collect surrender charges when our fixed and variable annuity contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period to protect us from premature withdrawals.  Fee income includes charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but excludes the attributed fees on our GLB riders; see “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” below for discussion of these attributed fees.

A portion of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our deferred fixed annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts.  Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  Certain types of commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.  Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized.  Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues.

Consists primarily of mutual fund account program revenues from mid to large employers.

 

Comparison of 2020 to 2019

 

Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields and lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums, partially offset by investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio and higher average fixed account values.  

 

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by lower commissions and other expenses driven by expense management and incentive compensation as a result of production performance, partially offset by the effect of unlocking.

 

See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for information about unlocking.

 

Additional Information

 

For a

 

discussion of the expected and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “

Introduction – Executive Summary

” above and “

Part I – Item 1A. 

Risk Factors

 – Market Conditions – The 

impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.”

 

Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented and terminating over the course of the year.

New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business.  Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations.  The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business.  An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused by plan sponsor terminations and participant withdrawals.  These outflows as a percentage of average account values were 13%, 12% and 11% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  

 

Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Net Flows By Market table below as “

Multi-Fund

® and other”), which are among our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs.  The proportion of these products to our total account values was 19%, 21% and 23% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.

Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis.  Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.  We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.  

For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” and “Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”

Comparison of 2020 to 2019

 

Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:

 



Higher benefits due to unfavorable mortality as a result of impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in business in force, partially offset by the effect of unlocking.



Lower fee income due to the effect of unlocking, partially offset by growth in business in force.

 

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:

 



Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by investment income on alternative investments, partially offset by spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields and lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.



Lower commissions and other expenses due to lower amortization rates, expense management and incentive compensation as a result of production performance, partially offset by the effect of unlocking. 

 

See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for information about unlocking. 

 

Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain

 

Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels.  Term products and other products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”), Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”) and the principles-based reserving framework.  For information on strategies we use to reduce the statutory reserve strain, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus” below.

Additional Information

 

Strategic repricing actions to respond to the low interest rate environment have contributed to lower sales for 2020 as compared to 2019.  We continue to expect elevated mortality to persist into 2021 as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For a discussion of the expected and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Introduction – Executive Summary” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.”

 

For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” and “Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”

 

Insurance Premiums

 

Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of business in force.  Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.

Fee income relates only to interest-sensitive products and includes cost of insurance assessments, expense assessments and surrender charges.  Both cost of insurance and expense assessments can have deferrals and amortization related to DFEL.  Cost of insurance and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values.  These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values.  Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. 

 

Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability.  For more information on sales, see “Additional Information” above.

 

Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:

 



MoneyGuard

®, our linked-benefit product – 15% of total expected premium deposits;



UL, IUL and VUL – first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received;



Executive Benefits – single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate-owned UL and VUL, first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received; and



Term – 100% of annualized first-year premiums.

 

We monitor the business environment, including but not limited to the regulatory and interest rate environments, and make changes to our product offerings and in-force products as needed, and as permitted under the terms of the policies, to sustain the future profitability of our segment.

Represents net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment and includes the effect of investment income on alternative investments for such assets that are held in the portfolios supporting statutory surplus versus the portfolios supporting product liabilities.

 

A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts.  Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements.  Investments allocated to this segment are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements.  These financing transactions lead to a transfer of investments from this segment to Other Operations.  We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts.  We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products.  Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products.  In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves.  These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of assessments and benefits causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.  Generally, we have higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims.  See “Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Funds” in Note 1 for additional information.

For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.  When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for 2020 and 2019, the increase was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with higher commission rates.

Comparison of 2020 to 2019

 

Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to higher benefits driven by unfavorable experience in our life and disability businesses and unfavorable reserve adjustments in 2020 as compared to favorable reserve adjustments in 2019 due to modifying certain assumptions on the reserves in these businesses, partially offset by lower incidence in our dental business.

 

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following: 

 



Higher insurance premiums due to favorable persistency.



Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio.



Lower commissions and other expenses driven by expense management and incentive compensation as a result of production performance.

Additional Information

 

The total loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2020, was driven primarily by unfavorable mortality in our life business and unfavorable morbidity in our disability business due primarily to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Additionally, we experienced higher new claims severity, delays in social security approvals and higher incidence in our disability business, partially offset by lower incidence in our dental business due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We continue to expect an unfavorable loss ratio to persist into 2021 as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, we anticipate both morbidity headwinds in our disability business related to the economic environment and continued delays in social security approvals to persist into 2021.  For a discussion of the expected and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Introduction – Executive Summary” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.”

 

Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations as group-underwriting risks change over time.  We expect normal fluctuations in our total loss ratio, as claims experience is inherently uncertain.  For every one percent increase in the total loss ratio, we would expect an annual decrease to income from operations of approximately $32 million to $36 million.  The effects are symmetrical for a comparable decrease in the loss ratio and, therefore, move in an equal and opposite direction.

 

For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity.”

Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers.  The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force.  Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.  

 

Sales relate to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders.  We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.  Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our products.  The decrease in sales when comparing 2020 to 2019 was primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in fewer cases going to market and a more highly competitive and price-sensitive market.

 

Net Investment Income

 

We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our investments.

Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized as a level percent of insurance premiums of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.  Certain broker commissions that vary with and are related to paid premiums are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.  Generally, we have higher amortization in the first quarter of the year due to a significant number of policies renewing in the quarter.  The decrease in DAC deferrals as a percentage of insurance premiums when comparing 2020 to 2019 was primarily driven by lower deferrable acquisition costs incurred in 2020, some of which resulted from lower sales due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher persistency.

Includes our disability income business, which has a corresponding offset in benefits for changes in reserves. 

 

Comparison of 2020 to 2019

 

Loss from operations for Other Operations increased due primarily to the following:

 



Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, related to lower allocated investments driven by a decline in excess capital retained by Other Operations.



Less favorable income tax benefits driven by lower excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.



Higher benefits attributable to unfavorable experience and reserve adjustments in our run-off disability income business.

 

The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by lower interest and debt expense driven by a decline in average interest rates.

 

Additional Information

 

We expect to continue making investments as part of our strategic digitization initiative, which are expected to be more than offset by the associated expense savings in the business segments.  For more information, see “Introduction – Executive Summary – Significant Operational Matters – Strategic Digitization Initiative.”

 

Net Investment Income and Interest Credited 

 

We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments.  Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations.  

If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.

 

Write-downs for impairments decrease the recorded value of investments owned by the business segments.  These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments.  When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations.  Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of investments between the business segments and Other Operations.

The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001.  A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements.  The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business.  There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.

 

Benefits

 

Benefits are recognized when incurred for institutional pension products and disability income business.

(2)

Includes state guaranty funds assessments to cover losses to contract holders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies.  Mandatory assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states.

(3)

Consists of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its access to a financing facility and issuance of LOCs.  

 

Interest and Debt Expense

 

Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.  For additional information on our financing activities, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” below.

As of December 31, 2020, the Modco investment portfolio included fixed maturity securities classified as AFS with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”).  Since the corresponding and offsetting changes in fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the Modco investment portfolio are recorded in realized gain (loss), volatility can occur within net income (loss).  See Note 9 for more information.

 

Comparison of

 2020 

to 2019 

 

We had higher realized losses due primarily to the following:

 



Unfavorable variable annuity net derivatives results driven by unfavorable hedge program performance due to more volatile markets, partially offset by favorable GLB NPR component results.  An update to our NPR input to the fair value calculation of our GLB embedded derivatives and the effect of unlocking drove favorable GLB NPR component results, partially offset by our associated reserves decreasing and credit spreads narrowing.



Higher losses related to certain financial assets due to an increase in our allowance for credit losses.

 

 

The higher realized losses were partially offset by the 

following:

 



Gains on the mark-to-market on certain instruments due primarily to favorable changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives related to certain Modco arrangements.

 



Lower losses related to our indexed annuity forward-starting option driven by the effect of unlocking and a decrease in option costs. 

 

The above components of excluded realized gain (loss) are described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax.

 

See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for more information about unlocking.

Operating Realized Gain (Loss)

 

Operating realized gain (loss) includes indexed annuity and IUL net derivatives results representing the net difference between the change in the fair value of the options that we hold and a portion of the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity and IUL products. The portion of the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities reported in operating realized gain (loss) represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity and IUL contracts.

 

Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves.  We calculate the value of the benefit reserves and the embedded derivative reserves based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature.  

For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we record them at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recorded in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”).  These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).

 

We also include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain (loss) and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized gain (loss).  For our Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in fee income. 

 

Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Financial Assets

 

For information on realized gain (loss) related to certain financial assets, see Note 16.

 

Gain (Loss) on the Mark-to-Market on Certain Instruments

 

Gain (loss) on the mark-to-market on certain instruments, including those associated with our consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) represents changes in the fair values of certain derivative investments (not including those associated with our variable annuity net derivatives results), reinsurance related embedded derivatives and trading securities.

 

See Note 4 for information about our consolidated VIEs.  

 

Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results

 

Our variable annuity net derivatives results include the net valuation premium, the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.  In addition, these results include the changes in reserves not accounted for at fair value and results from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders. 

 

We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded derivative reserves.  The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in embedded derivative reserves.  Our variable annuity net derivatives results can be volatile, especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur.  We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability.  

The NPR factors affect the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve.  Our methodology for calculating the NPR component of the embedded derivative reserve utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of expected cash flows over the expected life of the embedded derivative.  Our cash flows consist of both expected fees to be received from contract holders and benefits to be paid, and these cash flows are different on a pre- and post-NPR basis.  We utilize a model based on our holding company’s credit default swap (“CDS”) spread adjusted to reflect the credit quality of our insurance subsidiary as the issuing entity.  Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the effect of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries.

Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option

 

The liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index options we may purchase or sell in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase or sell in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

Investment Objective

 

Investments are an integral part of our operations.  We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities.  This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives.  This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities.  For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

 

Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification

 

Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes.  Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments.  We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.  

 

We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios

 

In 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, which resulted in a new recognition and measurement of credit losses on most financial assets.  See Note 2 for additional information.  Fixed maturity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading.  Details underlying our fixed maturity AFS securities by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below.  These tables agree in total with the presentation of fixed maturity AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the fixed maturity AFS portfolio.  Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.

Fixed Maturity AFS Securities

 

In accordance with the fixed maturity AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses.  Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes.  Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to AOCI.  For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business.  Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.  

 

The quality of our fixed maturity AFS securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:

Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”)).  For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second lowest rating assigned is used.  For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. 

 

Comparisons between the NAIC designations and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC.  The NAIC assigns securities quality designations and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements.  The NAIC designations are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds.  NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch) by such ratings organizations.  However, securities designated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting.  NAIC designations 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch). 

 

As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, 78% and 87%, respectively, of the total fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position were investment grade.  See Note 5 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio.  Our gross unrealized losses 

recognized in OCI

 on fixed maturity AFS securities as of December 31, 2020, decreased by $45 million since December 31, 2019.  For further information on our unrealized losses on fixed maturity AFS securities, see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity AFS Securities” below.

We believe the unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020, did not require an impairment recognized in earnings as:  (i) we did not intend to sell these fixed maturity AFS securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and

 (iii) the difference in the fair value compared to the amortized cost was due to factors other than credit loss.  This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process.  Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:

 



The current economic environment and market conditions;



Our business strategy and current business plans;



The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;



Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;



The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;



The capital risk limits approved by management; and



Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.

 

To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:

 



Historical and implied volatility of the security;



The extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; 



Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area; 



Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and



Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. 

 

As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $155.7 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $129.7 billion as of December 31, 2020.  If it were necessary to liquidate fixed maturity AFS securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those fixed maturity AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $117.0 billion as of December 31, 2020, rather than selling fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position.  The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point in time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business.  See “Fixed Maturity AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Notes 1 and 5 for additional discussion.

 

As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $19.1 billion and $17.0 billion, respectively, representing 

12% and 13% of total investments, respectively

.

 

Trading Securities

 

Trading securities, which in certain cases support reinsurance funds withheld and our Modco reinsurance agreements, are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in net income as they occur.  Investment results for these certain portfolios, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements.  Offsetting these amounts in certain cases are corresponding changes in fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement.  See Notes 1 and 9 for more information regarding Modco.

 

Mortgage-Backed Securities (Included in Fixed Maturity AFS and Trading Securities)

 

Our fixed maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”). These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments.  This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase.  Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss.  Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain.  In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities.  Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite effect.  The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by:  the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.  

 

We limit the extent of our risk on MBS by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities with improving collateral performance, and by primarily investing in securities that are current pay and senior priority in their trust structure.  A significant amount of assets in our MBS portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, supported in the securitization structure by junior securities or purchased at discounted prices significantly lower than their expected recovery value, enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.

Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be affected by subprime lending and direct investments in ABS and RMBS.  Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages.  These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness:  prime; Alt-A; and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles.  Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income.  Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.

 

Delinquency and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans have been showing positive trends, and, as long as the unemployment rate remains stable to improving, we expect these trends to continue.  We continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own.  The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the first loss.  Our ABS home equity and RMBS had a market value of $3.6 billion and a net unrealized gain of $366 million as of December 31, 2020.

Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity AFS Securities

 

When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the position of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the position of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date.  Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios.  These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of securities in an unrealized loss position on our future earnings.

Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.

 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, alternative investments included investments in 271 and 258 different partnerships, respectively, and 

the portfolio represented approximately 1% of total investments.  

The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners.  Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner.  These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date.  The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity.  Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 

Non-Income Producing Investments

 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $13 million and $9 million, respectively.

We earn investment income on our general account assets supporting fixed annuity, term life, whole life, UL, interest-sensitive whole life and the fixed portion of retirement plan and VUL products.  The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable.  Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments.  These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

 

Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums

 

Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity.  A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity.  These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.

 

The increase in prepayment and make-whole premiums when comparing 2020 to 2019 was attributable primarily to increased refinancing activity.

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, we recognized credit loss expense incurred and write-downs taken as a result of impairments through net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, we recognized write-downs taken as a result of OTTI through net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2019.

 

The $26 million of impairments recognized in net income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2020, were all credit-related impairments.  The increase in credit losses was primarily attributable to the destabilization of the energy industry.  For a discussion of the expected and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Introduction – Executive Summary” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Rick Factors – Market Conditions – The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.”

 

REIN

SURANCE

 

Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies.  The portion of our life insurance risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limit is reinsured with other insurers.  We seek life and annuity reinsurance coverage to limit our exposure to mortality losses and/or to enhance our capital and risk management.  

We acquire other reinsurance as applicable with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances.  The consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” reflect insurance premiums, insurance fees, benefits and DAC amortization net of insurance ceded.  Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.  

We utilize inter-company reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees.  With regard to risk retention from a consolidated basis, these inter-company agreements do not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.  For information regarding reserve financing and LOC expenses from inter-company reinsurance agreements, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Uses of Capital – Contractual Obligations” below.

 

We focus on obtaining reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers.  We have established standards and criteria for our use and selection of reinsurers.  In order for a new reinsurer to participate in our current program, we generally require the reinsurer to have an A.M. Best rating of A+ or greater or an S&P rating of AA- or better and a specified RBC percentage (or similar capital ratio measure).  If the reinsurer does not have these ratings, we may require them to post collateral as described below; however, we may waive the collateral requirements based on the facts and circumstances.  In addition, we may require collateral from a reinsurer to mitigate credit/collectability risk.  Typically, in such cases, the reinsurer must either maintain minimum specified ratings and RBC ratios or establish the specified quality and quantity of collateral.  Similarly, we have also required collateral in connection with books of business sold pursuant to indemnity reinsurance agreements.

 

Reinsurers, including affiliated reinsurers, that are not licensed, accredited or authorized in the state of domicile of the reinsured (“ceding company”), i.e., unauthorized reinsurers, are required to post statutorily prescribed forms of collateral for the ceding company to receive reinsurance credit.  The three primary forms of collateral are:  (i) qualifying assets held in a reserve credit trust; (ii) irrevocable, unconditional, evergreen LOCs issued by a qualified U.S. financial institution; and (iii) assets held by the ceding company in a segregated funds withheld account.  Collateral must be maintained in accordance with the rules of the ceding company’s state of domicile and must be readily accessible by the ceding company to cover claims under the reinsurance agreement.  Accordingly, our insurance subsidiaries require unauthorized reinsurers to post acceptable forms of collateral to support their reinsurance obligations to us.  

 

As a result of our Modco agreement with Athene to reinsure fixed and fixed indexed annuity products, we recorded a $5.8 billion deposit asset reflected within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.  For additional information, see Note 9.

Table of Contents

 




 

 

Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.  As of December 31, 2020, 85%, or $14.1 billion, of our total reinsurance recoverable was secured by collateral for our benefit.  Of this amount, $13.8 billion was held by reinsurers in reserve credit trusts (such reserve credit trusts are held by non-affiliated reinsurers; therefore, they are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets), $1.9 billion was reflected as funds withheld reinsurance liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020, although only $151 million can be utilized as collateral due to excess funds withheld above the reinsurance recoverable from our reinsurers, and $151 million was secured by LOCs for which we are the beneficiary, an off-balance sheet arrangement.

 

We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration risk with our largest reinsurers at least annually.  

We monitor all of our existing reinsurers’ financial strength ratings on a monthly basis.  We also monitor our reinsurers’ financial health, trends and commitment to the reinsurance business, statutory surplus, RBC levels, statutory earnings and fluctuations, current claims payment aging and our reinsurers’ own reinsurers.  In addition, we present at least annually information regarding our reinsurance exposures to the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.  For more discussion of our counterparty risk with our reinsurers, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Operational Matters – We face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which could materially affect our results of operations.”

 

Under certain indemnity reinsurance agreements, two of our insurance subsidiaries, LNL and LLANY, provide 100% indemnity reinsurance for the business assumed; however, the third-party insurer, or the “cedent,” remains primarily liable on the underlying insurance business.  These indemnity reinsurance arrangements require that our subsidiary, as the reinsurer, maintain certain insurer financial strength ratings and capital ratios.  If these ratings or capital ratios are not maintained, depending upon the reinsurance agreement, the cedent may recapture the business, or require us to place assets in trust or provide LOCs at least equal to the relevant statutory reserves.  Under the LNL reinsurance arrangement, we held approximately $2.9 billion of statutory reserves as of December 31, 2020.  LNL must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody’s financial strength rating of at least Baa3.  This arrangement may require LNL to place assets in trust equal to the relevant statutory reserves.  Under LLANY’s largest indemnity reinsurance arrangement, we held approximately $1.2 billion of statutory reserves as of December 31, 2020.  LLANY must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B+, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BB+ and a Moody’s financial strength rating of at least Ba1, as well as maintain an RBC ratio of at least 160% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 100%, or the cedent may recapture the business.  Under two other LLANY arrangements, by which we established $672 million of statutory reserves as of December 31, 2020, LLANY must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody’s financial strength rating of at least Baa3.  One of these arrangements also requires LLANY to maintain an RBC ratio of at least 185% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 115%.  Each of these arrangements may require LLANY to place assets in trust equal to the relevant statutory reserves.  See “Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” for a description of our financial strength ratings.

 REVIEW 

OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION

 

Liquidity 

and Capital Resources

 

Overview

 

Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety.  Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of investments.  Our operating activities provided (used) cash of $534 million, $(2.7) billion and $1.9 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC.  As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance or repay funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance.  The sources of liquidity and cash flow of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement.  These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets, including any current or future impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially affect our business operations and results of operations.  These poor market conditions may reduce our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC requiring them to retain more capital and may pressure their ability to pay dividends to LNC, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital.  We monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.  Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash.  As of December 31, 2020, the holding company had available liquidity of $754 million, which includes amounts related to the pre-funding of our $300 million senior notes due 2022.  Based on the sources of liquidity and cash flow available to us as discussed below, we currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection.

The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below).  Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.  Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.  See “Part IV – Item 15(a)(2) Financial Statement Schedules – Schedule II – Condensed Financial Information of Registrant” for the parent company cash flow statement.

 

Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments

 

We are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries.  Our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries.  Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.

Table of Contents

 




 

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”), may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) only from unassigned surplus or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation.  The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus.  Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.  LNL’s subsidiaries, the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”), a New York-domiciled insurance company, and LLACB, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurance company, are bound by similar restrictions, under New York law and New Hampshire law, respectively.  Under both New York and New Hampshire law, the applicable statutory limitation on dividends is equal to the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.

 

Indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend that violates these standards.  In the event the Commissioner determines that the contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate, the Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary.

 

We expect our direct domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends to LNC of approximately $865 million in 2021 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners.  The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.  

 

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities.  These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.  An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment.  In addition, further impairment could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.

 

Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus 

 

Our insurance subsidiaries must maintain certain regulatory capital levels.  We utilize the RBC ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our insurance subsidiaries.  The RBC ratio is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries, as a reduction in our insurance subsidiaries’ surplus may affect their RBC ratios and dividend-paying capacity.  For a discussion of RBC ratios, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation – Risk-Based Capital.”

 

Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.  Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to XXX and AG38, respectively.  Our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to reinsurance captives.  Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner.  We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves.  Included in the LOCs issued as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $2.1 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements for UL products containing secondary guarantees ($201 million will expire in 2024 and $1.9 billion relates to arrangements that will expire by 2031).  For information on the LOCs, see the credit facilities table in Note 13.  Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have also issued long-term notes of $3.6 billion to finance a portion of the excess reserves as of December 31, 2020; of this amount, $2.6 billion involve exposure to VIEs.  For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 4.  We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions primarily supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees.  LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  

 

Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company.  The NAIC’s adoption of the Valuation Manual that defines a principles-based reserving framework for newly issued life insurance policies was effective January 1, 2017.  We adopted the framework for our newly issued term business in 2017 and phased in the framework through January 1, 2020, for all other newly issued life insurance products.  We continue to analyze the effects of principles-based reserving on the use of captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and third-party reinsurance for reserve financing transactions for our life insurance business.  For more information on the NAIC’s adoption of principles-based reserving, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation.”

Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and interest rates, and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements.  As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period.  Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves.  We also utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements to manage our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees.  

 

Changes in equity markets may also affect the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries.  We may decide to reallocate available capital among our insurance subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurance subsidiaries, which would result in different RBC ratios for our insurance subsidiaries.  In addition, changes in the equity markets can affect the value of our variable annuity and variable universal life insurance separate accounts.  When the market value of our separate account assets increases, the statutory surplus within our insurance subsidiaries also increases.  Contrarily, when the market value of our separate account assets decreases, the statutory surplus within our insurance subsidiaries may also decrease, which may affect RBC ratios, and in the case of our separate account assets becoming less than the related product liabilities, we must allocate additional capital to fund the difference.

 

We continue

 to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.  

 

Financing Activities

 

Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.  

 

We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.

To hedge the variability in rates, we purchased interest rate swaps to lock in a fixed rate of approximately 5% over the remaining terms of the capital securities.  

 

During March 2020, we entered into a $500 million floating-rate loan maturing on March 30, 2022 (the “2022 Term Loan”).  In addition, during March 2020, we unwound the fair value hedge on our 7.00% senior notes due 2040 and entered into two fair value hedges on the same notes, which generated capital deployed for general corporate purposes.  During May 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.40% senior notes due 2031 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.375% senior notes due 2050.  We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the redemption of our $296 million 4.85% senior notes due 2021 and to repay the 2022 Term Loan.  For more information, see Note 13.

 

We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales.  For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.

If current credit ratings or claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity.  For the majority of our derivative counterparties, there is a termination event with respect to LNC if its long-term senior debt ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s); or with respect to LNL if its financial strength ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s).  Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of December 31, 2020.  In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products.  

See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors –

Our indicative credit ratings published by the primary rating agencies are set forth below.  Securities are rated at the time of issuance so actual ratings may differ from the indicative ratings.  There may be other rating agencies that also provide credit ratings, which we do not disclose in our reports. 

 

The long-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows: 

 



A.M. Best – aaa to c



Fitch – AAA to D 



Moody’s – Aaa to C

A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital.  In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described in “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings.”

 

All ratings are on outlook stable.  

All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that we can maintain these ratings.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Management monitors the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities.  If we fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels (also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”).  This would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price.  We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed.  If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient shares of common stock or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock.  Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock.  We have not triggered either the net income test or the overall stockholders’ equity test looking forward to the quarters ending March 31, 2021, and June 30, 2021.  For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve specified capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels, which would dilute the current holders of our common stock.”

 

Alternative Sources of Liquidity

 

Inter-company Cash Management Program

 

In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs.  The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs.  As of December 31, 2020, the holding company had a net outstanding receivable (payable) of $(254) million from (to) certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed (borrowed) by the holding company and subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account.  Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash.  The holding company had an average borrowing balance of $1.0 billion from the cash management program during 2020.  The holding company had a maximum and minimum amount of financing from the cash management program during 2020 of $1.4 billion and $322 million, respectively.  Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions.  For our Indiana and New Hampshire-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end.  For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of its most recent year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.

 

Facility Agreement for Senior Notes Issuance

 

During August 2020, LNC entered into a facility agreement with a Delaware trust that gives LNC the right over a 10-year period to issue, from time to time, up to $500 million of 2.330% senior notes to the trust in exchange for a corresponding amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by the trust.  By agreeing to purchase the 2.330% senior notes in exchange for U.S. Treasury securities upon exercise of the issuance right, the trust will provide a source of liquid assets for the Company.  For additional details, see Note 13.

 

Federal Home Loan Bank

 

Our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”).  Membership allows LNL access to the FHLBI’s financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets, agency securities or U.S. Treasury securities.  Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBI’s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LNL.  As of December 31, 2020, LNL had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $7.0 billion under the FHLBI facility and maximum available borrowing based on qualifying assets of $4.4 billion.  As of December 31, 2020, LNL had outstanding borrowings of $3.1 billion reported within payables for collateral on investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  In October 2020, LLANY became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”) with an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $750 million.  Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBNY’s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LLANY.  As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings.  For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.

 

Securities Lending Programs and Repurchase Agreements

 

Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements.  As of December 31, 2020, our insurance subsidiaries had securities pledged under securities lending agreements with a carrying value of $115 million.  In addition, our insurance subsidiaries had access to $750 million through a committed repurchase agreement.  The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash and invested cash or fixed maturity AFS securities.  For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.

Collateral on Derivative Contracts

 

Our cash flows associated with collateral received from counterparties (when we are in a net payable position) and posted with counterparties (when we are in a net receivable position) change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes.  The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged.  As of December 31, 2020, we were in a net collateral payable position of $1.9 billion compared to $830 million as of December 31, 2019.  During 2020, our net collateral payable position increased due primarily to decreasing interest rates that increased the fair values of our associated over-the-counter derivative investments.  In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty.  If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have committed liquidity sources through facilities that can provide up to $1.25 billion of additional liquidity to help meet collateral needs.  Access to such facilities is contingent upon interest rates having achieved certain threshold levels.  In addition to these facilities, we have the facility agreement for senior notes issuance, the FHLB facilities and the repurchase agreements discussed above as well as the five-year revolving credit facility discussed in Note 13 to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting.  For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 6.

 

Uses of Capital

 

Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders, to repurchase our stock and to repay debt. 

 

Return of Capital to Common Stockholders 

 

One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases.  In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility.  On November 3, 2020, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.40 to $0.42 per share.  The amount and timing of share repurchases depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital.  Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.  

During the second and third quarters of 2020, we suspended common stock repurchases under our buyback program; however, we resumed common stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2020.  W

e may repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2021 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital.  For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Estimates are based on financial projections over 40 years and are not discounted for the time value of money.  New business issued or acquired, business ceded or sold, changes to or variances from actuarial assumptions and economic conditions will cause these amounts to change over time, possibly materially.  See Note 1 for details of what these liabilities include and represent.

Represents certain financing arrangements that did not meet the requirements to be classified as a sale-leaseback arrangement.

(7)

Includes anticipated funding for benefit payments for our retirement and postretirement plans through 2030 and known payments under deferred compensation arrangements.  In addition to these benefit payments, we periodically fund the employees’ defined benefit plans.  The majority of contributions and benefit payments are made by our insurance subsidiaries with little effect on holding company cash flow.  See Note 18 for additional information.

 

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.  Therefore, $51 million of unrecognized tax benefits and its associated interest have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.  See Note 7 for additional information.

 

Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 

During August 2020, LNC entered into a facility agreement with a Delaware trust that gives LNC the right over a 10-year period to issue, from time to time, up to $500 million of 2.330% senior notes to the trust in exchange for a corresponding amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by the trust.  The issuance right will be exercised automatically in full upon our failure to make certain payments to the trust, if the failure to pay is not cured within 30 days, or upon certain bankruptcy events involving LNC.  We are also required to exercise the issuance right in full if our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding AOCI) falls below $2.75 billion, subject to adjustment from time to time in certain cases, and upon certain other events described in the facility agreement.  For more information, see Note 13.

 

Other than as described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 

We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification.  By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value.  We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk.  The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the investments support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products.  As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility.  In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings.  Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions.  Our primary sources of market risk are substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values.  These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes presented in 

“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

 

Interest Rate Risk 

 

 

Interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates.  We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from our fixed maturity securities and interest sensitive liabilities.

 

With respect to accumulation and investment-oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income we earn on our investments and interest credited to account values of our contract holders.  If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced. 

 

The combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next 12 months, asset-liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges all work together to mitigate this risk.  The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial, relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long period or a rapid increase in interest rates.

Includes the impact on bond funds in our separate accounts, which move in the opposite direction of interest rates. 

 

For purposes of this estimate, we assumed asset purchases are made at prevailing new money rates and exclude the impact of new business, unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the interest rate changes.  

 

Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates

 

In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments.  Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and MBS in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk.  Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.  

 

Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals.  However, we have recognized this risk and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment.  For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.    

See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” for additional information on interest rate risks.

The average crediting rates were 39 basis points, 12 basis points and 22 basis point in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.

(4)

The average crediting rates were 147 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates.  Of our account values for these products, 17% are scheduled to reset in more than one year but not more than two years; 25% are scheduled to reset in more than two years but not more than three years; and 58% are scheduled to reset in more than three years. 

(5)

For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to income annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business.  For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates primarily to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 23 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates, and 72% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.

 

The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates.  We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios.  We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.

 

Long-Term New Money Investment Yield Sensitivity

 

New money rates continue to be at low levels and, as a result, require careful analysis when forecasting the future direction of changes in rates.  We updated our interest rate assumptions during 2020, which included reducing our long-term new money investment yield assumption (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for more information).  If we were to further change our view of future new money rates and lower our current long-term new money investment yield assumption, then, assuming that all other assumptions remain constant, we estimate the impact of lowering this assumption by 50 basis points would be approximately $(180) million to income (loss) from operations due primarily to unlocking our DAC and VOBA assets.  This impact would be most pronounced in our Life Insurance segment.  The actual impact of a 50 basis point decline in the yield would be based upon a number of factors existing at the time of the assumption update, and, therefore, the actual amount of the loss may differ from our current estimate.  In addition, lower investment margins may also impact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill, require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss recognition events on certain policyholder liabilities.

Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Rising Rates

 

For both annuities and universal life insurance, a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders.  The portfolios supporting these products have fixed-rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from 1 to 10 years or more.  Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields.  As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing MBS prepayments.  The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates.  If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors’ new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders.  If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow.  We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios.  Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by entering into interest rate cap corridor agreements.  With these instruments in place, the potential adverse effect of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances.  

 

Short-Term and Long-Term Debt

 

 

We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise.  See Note 13 for additional information on our debt.

 

Derivatives

 

See Note 6 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.

 

Equity Market Risk

 

Equity market risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of equity securities or equity indices.  Our revenues, assets and liabilities are exposed to equity market risk that we often hedge with derivatives.  Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.  However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets.  Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in the MD&A for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.

 

Fee Income 

 

The fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values.  These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management.  In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions.  Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed-income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors’ customers.

 

Equity Assets

 

While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed-income investments, the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed-income investments.  These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed-income investments.  

 

Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk

 

We enter into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market risk.  Such derivatives include over-the-counter equity options, total return swaps, variance swaps, and equity futures.  See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations.

Liabilities

 

We have exposure to changes in our stock price through both our deferred and stock-based incentive compensation plans.  For additional information on our deferred and stock-based incentive compensations plans, see Notes 18 and 19, respectively.

 

Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity

 

If the level of the equity markets were to have instantaneously increased or decreased by 1% immediately after December 31, 2020, we estimate the effect on income (loss) from operations for the next 12-month period from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses would be approximately $10 million.  For purposes of this estimate, we excluded any effect related to net flows, unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance, customer behavior or reduction in account values attributable to contract holder assessments.

 

The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee income and asset-based expenses is generally not fully recognized in the first quarter of the change because fee income is earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values.  The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end-of-period variable account values affects fee income in subsequent periods.  Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases or decreases in the equity markets.  This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative and is concentrated primarily in our Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments.  Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency.  For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.

Credit Risk

 

Credit risk is the risk to earnings and capital that arises from uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms.  We are exposed to credit risk primarily by our investments in corporate bonds and mortgage loans on real estate and through our use of derivatives.

 

Investments

 

The majority of our credit risk is concentrated in investment holdings.  Our portfolio of investments was $154.0 billion and $133.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Of this total, $105.9 billion and $92.0 billion consisted of corporate bonds and $16.8 billion and $16.3 billion consisted of mortgage loans on real estate as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower-quality, higher-yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type.  For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality.  Additional diversification limits, such as limits per industry, are also applied.  We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing. 

 

Derivatives

 

 

We are exposed to counterparty credit risk through our various derivative contracts.  We depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements.  In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor.  We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an “A” credit rating or above.  See Note 6 for additional information on managing the credit risk of our counterparties.  

 

We are also exposed to credit risk through the use of certain derivatives.  We buy credit default swaps to minimize our exposure to credit-related events with respect to a single entity or referenced index.  We also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors with respect to a single entity or referenced index.  

See Note 6 for additional information on our use of credit derivatives.

 

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 

 

Foreign Currency Denominated Investments

 

Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.  We have foreign currency exchange risk in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity securities.  The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the foreign denominated security.  

 

We invest in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies for incremental return and risk diversification relative to U.S. dollar-denominated securities.  We use foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our unhedged positions consisted of $6 million and $8 million, respectively, of principal in U.S. dollar equivalents of Canadian-denominated investments with maturity dates up to 2025 and an average interest rate of 2%.  As of the same dates, our Modco reinsurance portfolios were partially hedged and consisted of $184 million and $133 million, respectively, of principal in U.S. dollar equivalents of foreign denominated investments with maturity dates up to 2063 and an average interest rate of 4%.  Investment results for our Modco reinsurance agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers.  See “Interest Rate Risk – Significant Interest Rate Exposures” above for our notional amounts in U.S. dollar equivalents (in millions) by year of maturity for our foreign currency swaps.

 

See Note 6 for additional information on our foreign currency swaps used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Lincoln National Corporation to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  

 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of internal control over financial reporting effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.  

 

Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, the end of our fiscal year.  Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).  Management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. 

 

Based on the assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles.  

 

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on the following page.

Deferred Acquisition Costs Asset and Future Contract Benefits Liability

 

 

Description of the Matter

  

At December 31, 2020, deferred acquisition costs totaled $5.6 billion and future contract benefits liabilities totaled $40.8 billion, a portion of which related to universal life-type contracts with secondary guarantees and variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefit riders.

 

The carrying amount of the deferred acquisition costs related to these products is the total of costs deferred less amortization, which is calculated in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits of the underlying contracts. As described in Notes 1 (see section on 

DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL

) and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, there is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in calculating estimated gross profits as the calculation includes significant management judgment in developing certain assumptions, such as expected future mortality experience, investment margins, capital market performance, retention and rider utilization. Management’s assumptions are adjusted, also known as unlocked, for emerging experience and expected changes in trends. The unlocking results in deferred acquisition cost amortization being recalculated, using the new assumptions for estimated gross profits, that results either in additional or less cumulative amortization expense.

 

The future contract benefits liability related to these product guarantees is based on estimates of how much the Company will need to pay for future benefits and the amount of fees to be collected from policyholders for these policy features. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements (see section on 

Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Funds

), there is significant uncertainty inherent in estimating this liability because there is a significant amount of management judgment involved in developing certain assumptions that impact the liability balance, which are consistent with the assumptions used to amortize the related deferred acquisition cost asset as noted above and which include expected mortality experience, investment margins, capital market performance, retention and rider utilization.

 

Auditing the valuation of deferred acquisition costs and future contract benefits liabilities related to these products was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the high degree of judgment used by management in setting the assumptions used in the estimate of both the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the future contract benefits liability related to these products.

 

 

 

 

 

 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

  

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the deferred acquisition costs and future contract benefits liability estimation processes, including, among others, controls related to the review and approval processes that management has in place for the assumptions used in estimating the estimated gross profits related to deferred acquisition costs and the future contract benefits liability. This included testing controls related to management’s evaluation of the need to update assumptions based on the comparison of actual Company experience to previous assumptions and updating investment margins for current and expected future market conditions.

 

We involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures which included, among others, an evaluation of the methodology applied by management with those methods used in prior periods. To assess the significant assumptions used by management, we compared the significant assumptions noted above to historical experience, observable market data or management’s estimates of prospective changes in these assumptions. In addition, we performed an independent recalculation of estimated gross profits related to deferred policy acquisition costs and the future policy benefit reserves for a sample of cohorts or contracts which we compared to the actuarial model used by management.

Variable Annuity Guaranteed Living Benefit Riders Embedded Derivatives

 

 

Description of the Matter

  

The Company’s variable annuity guaranteed living benefit riders include an embedded derivative, represented by an asset totaling $450 million as of December 31, 2020, related to the non-life contingent feature of the product which is accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in income. As described in Notes 1 (see section on 

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities

), 6 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, there is a significant amount of estimation uncertainty inherent in measuring the fair value of the embedded derivative because of the sensitivity of certain assumptions underlying the estimate, including stock market performance, policy lapse experience and rider utilization. Management’s assumptions are adjusted over time for emerging experience and expected changes in trends, resulting in changes to the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative.

 

Auditing the valuation of the embedded derivative related to variable annuity guaranteed living benefit riders was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the high degree of judgment used by management in setting the assumptions used in the estimate of the value of the embedded derivative.

 

 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

  

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the embedded derivative estimation process, including, among others, controls related to the review and approval processes that management has in place to develop the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the embedded derivative. This included testing controls related to management’s evaluation of current and future market conditions and the need to update policy lapse and rider utilization assumptions. 

 

We involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures which included, among others, an evaluation of the methodology applied by management with those methods used in prior periods. To assess the significant assumptions used by management, we compared the significant assumptions noted above to historical experience, observable market data or management’s estimates of prospective changes in these assumptions. In addition, we performed an independent recalculation of the embedded derivative for a sample of contracts which we compared to the fair value model used by management.

 

 

  

Valuation of Goodwill for the Life Insurance Reporting Unit

 

 

Description of the Matter

  

At December 31, 2020, the Company’s goodwill was $1.8 billion, of which $634 million related to the Company’s Life Insurance reporting unit. As discussed in Notes 1 (see section on 

Goodwill

) and 10 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. Determining the fair value of the Life Insurance reporting unit as part of the goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate, which reflects the market expected, weighted-average rate of return adjusted for the risk factors associated with the operations, and other relevant assumptions impacting projected financial information, such as the profitability of new and in-force business, all of which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.

 

Auditing the fair value of the Company’s Life Insurance reporting unit was complex and required the involvement of our valuation and actuarial specialists due to the high degree of judgment used by management.

 

 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

  

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process. This included, among others, controls related to the review and approval processes that management has in place to develop the assumptions used in the estimation process, including management’s determination of the applicable discount rate, and other assumptions for the Life Insurance reporting unit.

 

We involved actuarial and valuation specialists to assist with our audit procedures which included, among others, an evaluation of the methodology applied by management with those methods used in prior periods. To assess the significant assumptions used by management, we compared the significant assumptions noted above to current industry and economic trends, recent market transactions and other relevant factors. We reviewed the historical accuracy of management’s estimate and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the Life Insurance reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  Certain GAAP policies, which significantly affect the determination of financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, are summarized below.

 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

 

Principles of Consolidation

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LNC and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest and any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are the primary beneficiary.  As discussed in Note 3, on May 1, 2018, LNC and The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”) completed the acquisition of Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston (“Liberty Life”).  We use the equity method of accounting to recognize all of our investments in limited liability partnerships.  All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

 

Our involvement with VIEs is primarily to invest in assets that allow us to gain exposure to a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes.  A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or where investors lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  We assess our contractual, ownership or other interests in a VIE to determine if our interest participates in the variability the VIE was designed to absorb and pass onto variable interest holders.  We perform an ongoing qualitative assessment of our variable interests in VIEs to determine whether we have a controlling financial interest and would therefore be considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  If we determine we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE in our consolidated financial statements.

 

Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.  Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates.  Included among the material (or potentially material) reported amounts and disclosures that require extensive use of estimates are:  fair value of certain financial assets, derivatives, allowances for credit losses, 

deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”)

, 

value of business acquired (“VOBA”)

, deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), goodwill and other intangibles, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds including 

deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”)

, income taxes including the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, and the potential effects of resolving litigated matters.

 

Business Combinations

 

We use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combination transactions, and accordingly, recognize the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements.  The allocation of fair values may be subject to adjustment after the initial allocation for up to a one-year period as more information becomes available relative to the fair values as of the acquisition date.  The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of any acquired company since the acquisition date.

Fair Value Measurement

 

Our measurement of fair value is based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset or non-performance risk (“NPR”), which would include our own credit risk.  Our estimate of an exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability (“exit price”) in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or liability, as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or receive a liability (“entry price”).  Pursuant to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 

Accounting Standards 

Codification

TM 

(“ASC”), we categorize our financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of inputs to the respective valuation technique.  The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined as follows:

 



Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date, except for large holdings subject to “blockage discounts” that are excluded; 



Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value can be determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies; and



Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs in situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability, and we make estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the asset or liability, including assumptions regarding risk.

 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, the level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. 

 

When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.  Because certain securities trade in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information, the determination of fair value for these securities is inherently more difficult.  However, Level 3 fair value investments may include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 inputs, observable components, which are components that are actively quoted or can be validated to market-based sources.

 

Fixed Maturity Available-For-Sale Securities – Fair Valuation Methodologies and Associated Inputs

 

Securities classified as available-for-sale (“AFS”) consist of fixed maturity securities and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”), net of associated DAC, VOBA, 

DSI

, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes.  

 

We measure the fair value of our securities classified as fixed maturity AFS based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the security.  The most appropriate valuation methodology is selected based on the specific characteristics of the fixed maturity security, and we consistently apply the valuation methodology to measure the security’s fair value.  Our fair value measurement is based on a market approach that utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities.  Sources of inputs to the market approach primarily include third-party pricing services, independent broker quotations or pricing matrices.  We do not adjust prices received from third parties; however, we do analyze the third-party pricing services’ valuation methodologies and related inputs and perform additional evaluation to determine the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy.

 

The observable and unobservable inputs to our valuation methodologies are based on a set of standard inputs that we generally use to evaluate all of our fixed maturity AFS securities.  Observable inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data.  In addition, market indicators, industry and economic events are monitored, and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met.

 

For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some of the inputs described above may not be applicable.  For private placement securities, we use pricing matrices that utilize observable pricing inputs of similar public securities and Treasury yields as inputs to the fair value measurement.  Depending on the type of security or the daily market activity, standard inputs may be prioritized differently or may not be available for all fixed maturity AFS securities on any given day.  For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants.

 

For securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information, we use unobservable inputs to measure fair value.

The following summarizes our fair valuation methodologies and associated inputs, which are particular to the specified security type and are in addition to the defined standard inputs to our valuation methodologies for all of our fixed maturity AFS securities discussed above:

 



Corporate bonds and U.S. government bonds – We also use Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine

TM

 reported tables for our corporate bonds and vendor trading platform data for our U.S. government bonds.  



Mortgage- and asset-backed securities (“ABS”) – We also utilize additional inputs, which include new issues data, monthly payment information and monthly collateral performance, including prepayments, severity, delinquencies, step-down features and over collateralization features for each of our mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), which include collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage pass through securities backed by residential mortgages (“RMBS”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”).



State and municipal bonds – We also use additional inputs that include information from the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board, as well as material event notices, new issue data, issuer financial statements and Municipal Market Data benchmark yields for our state and municipal bonds.



Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities – We also utilize additional inputs of exchange prices (underlying and common stock of the same issuer) for our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities.

 

In order to validate the pricing information and broker-dealer quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent sales and observations of general market movements for those security classes.  We have policies and procedures in place to review the process that is utilized by our third-party pricing service and the output that is provided to us by the pricing service.  On a periodic basis, we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used by the pricing service, and we perform a comparison of the pricing service output to an alternative pricing source.  We also evaluate prices provided by our primary pricing service to ensure that they are not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the prices for unusual changes from period to period based on certain parameters or for lack of change from one period to the next. 

 

Fixed Maturity AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost

 

We regularly review our fixed maturity AFS securities (also referred to as “debt securities”) for declines in fair value that we determine to be impairment-related, including those attributable to credit risk factors that may require a credit loss allowance.

 

For our debt securities, we generally consider the following to determine whether our debt securities with unrealized losses are credit impaired:

 



The estimated range and average period until recovery;



The estimated range and average holding period to maturity;



Remaining payment terms of the security;



Current delinquencies and nonperforming assets of underlying collateral;



Expected future default rates;



Collateral value by vintage, geographic region, industry concentration or property type; 



Subordination levels or other credit enhancements as of the balance sheet date as compared to origination; and



Contractual and regulatory cash obligations.

 

For a debt security, if we intend to sell a security, or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the debt security is below amortized cost, we conclude that an impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  If we do not intend to sell a debt security, or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the debt security (referred to as the credit loss), we conclude that an impairment has occurred, and a credit loss allowance is recorded, with a corresponding charge to realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The remainder of the decline to fair value related to factors other than credit loss is recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) to unrealized losses on fixed maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, as this amount is considered a noncredit impairment.

When assessing our intent to sell a debt security, or if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its cost basis, we evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our security portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing.  Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:

 



The current economic environment and market conditions;



Our business strategy and current business plans;



The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;



Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;



The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;



The capital risk limits approved by management; and



Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.

 

In order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a debt security, we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover.  The discount rate is the effective interest rate implicit in the underlying debt security.  The effective interest rate is the original yield, or the coupon if the debt security was previously impaired.  See the discussion below for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by security type, that we use to determine the amount of a credit loss.

 

To determine the recovery period of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:

 



Historical and implied volatility of the security;



The extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; 



Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area; 



Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and



Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. 

 

In periods subsequent to the recognition of a credit loss impairment through a credit loss allowance, we continue to reassess the expected cash flows of the debt security at each subsequent measurement date as necessary.  If the measurement of credit loss changes, we recognize a provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense through realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), limited by the amount that amortized cost exceeds fair value.  Losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a debt security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.  Accrued interest on debt securities is written-off when deemed uncollectible.

 

To determine the recovery value of a corporate bond, CLO or CDO, we perform additional analysis related to the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:

 



Fundamentals of the issuer to determine what we would recover if they were to file bankruptcy versus the price at which the market is trading;



Fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer operates;



Earnings multiples for the given industry or sector of an industry that the underlying issuer operates within, divided by the outstanding debt to determine an expected recovery value of the security in the case of a liquidation;



Expected cash flows of the issuer (e.g., whether the issuer has cash flows in excess of what is required to fund its operations);



Expectations regarding defaults and recovery rates;



Changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and



Additional market information (e.g., if there has been a replacement of the corporate debt security).

Each quarter, we review the cash flows for the MBS portfolio, including current credit enhancements and trends in the underlying collateral performance to determine whether or not they are sufficient to provide for the recovery of our amortized cost.  

To determine recovery value of a MBS, we perform additional analysis related to the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:

 



Discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover;



Level of borrower creditworthiness of the home equity loans or residential mortgages that back an RMBS or commercial mortgages that back a CMBS;



Susceptibility to fair value fluctuations for changes in the interest rate environment;



Susceptibility to reinvestment risks, in cases where market yields are lower than the securities’ book yield earned;



Susceptibility to reinvestment risks, in cases where market yields are higher than the book yields earned on a security; 



Expectations of sale of such a security where market yields are higher than the book yields earned on a security; and 



Susceptibility to variability of prepayments.

 

When evaluating MBS and mortgage-related ABS, we consider a number of pool-specific factors as well as market level factors when determining whether or not the impairment on the security requires a credit loss allowance.  The most important factor is the performance of the underlying collateral in the security and the trends of that performance in the prior periods.  We use this information about the collateral to forecast the timing and rate of mortgage loan defaults, including making projections for loans that are already delinquent and for those loans that are currently performing but may become delinquent in the future.  Other factors used in this analysis include the credit characteristics of borrowers, geographic distribution of underlying loans and timing of liquidations by state.  Once default rates and timing assumptions are determined, we then make assumptions regarding the severity of a default if it were to occur.  Factors that impact the severity assumption include expectations for future home price appreciation or depreciation, loan size, first lien versus second lien, existence of loan level private mortgage insurance, type of occupancy and geographic distribution of loans.  Second lien loans are assigned 

100

% severity, if defaulted.  For first lien loans, we assume a minimum of 

30

% severity, with higher severity assumed for investor properties and further adjusted by housing price assumptions.  Once default and severity assumptions are determined for the security in question, cash flows for the underlying collateral are projected including expected defaults and prepayments.  These cash flows on the collateral are then translated to cash flows on our tranche based on the cash flow waterfall of the entire capital security structure.  If this analysis indicates the entire principal on a particular security will not be returned, the security is reviewed for a credit loss by comparing the expected cash flows to amortized cost.  To the extent that the security has already been impaired through a credit loss allowance or was purchased at a discount, such that the amortized cost of the security is less than or equal to the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, no credit loss allowance is required.  Otherwise, if the amortized cost of the security is greater than the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, and the security was not purchased at a discount greater than the expected principal loss, then an impairment through a credit loss allowance is recognized.

 

We further monitor the cash flows of all of our debt securities backed by mortgages on an ongoing basis.  We also perform detailed analysis on all of our subprime, Alt-A, non-agency residential MBS and on a significant percentage of our debt securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages.  The detailed analysis includes revising projected cash flows by updating the cash flows for actual cash received and applying assumptions with respect to expected defaults, foreclosures and recoveries in the future.  These revised projected cash flows are then compared to the amount of credit enhancement (subordination) in the structure to determine whether the amortized cost of the security is recoverable.  If it is not recoverable, we record an impairment through a credit loss allowance for the security.

 

Trading Securities

 

Trading securities consist of fixed maturity securities in designated portfolios, some of which support modified coinsurance (“Modco”) and coinsurance with funds withheld (“CFW”) reinsurance agreements.  Investment results for the portfolios that support Modco and CFW reinsurance agreements, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers pursuant to contractual terms of the reinsurance agreements.  Trading securities are carried at fair value, and changes in fair value and changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities associated with the underlying reinsurance agreements are recorded in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) as they occur. 

 

Equity Securities

 

Equity securities are carried at fair value, and changes in fair value are recorded in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) as they occur.  Equity securities consist primarily of common stock of publicly-traded companies, privately placed securities and mutual fund shares.  We measure the fair value of our equity securities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the security.  The most appropriate valuation methodology is selected based on the specific characteristics of the equity security.  Fair values of publicly-traded equity securities are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical or comparable securities.  When quoted prices are not available, we use valuation methodologies most appropriate for the specific asset.  Fair values for private placement securities are determined using discounted cash flow, earnings multiple and other valuation models.  The fair values of mutual fund shares that transact regularly are based on transaction prices of identical fund shares.

Alternative Investments 

 

Alternative investments, which consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships (“LPs”), are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 

We account for our investments in LPs using the equity method to determine the carrying value.  Recognition of alternative investment income is delayed due to the availability of the related financial statements, which are generally obtained from the partnerships’ general partners.  As a result, our private equity investments are generally on a three-month delay and our hedge funds are on a one-month delay.  In addition, the impact of audit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of the investees are typically received during the second quarter of each calendar year.  Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar-year period may not include the complete impact of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar-year period.  

 

Payables for Collateral on Investments

 

When we enter into collateralized financing transactions on our investments, a liability is recorded equal to the cash or non-cash collateral received.  This liability is included within payables for collateral on investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Income and expenses associated with these transactions are recorded as investment income and investment expenses within net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Changes in payables for collateral on investments are reflected within cash flows from investing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate

 

Mortgage loans on real estate consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans and are generally carried at unpaid principal balances adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts and are net of allowance for credit losses.  We carry certain commercial mortgage loans at fair value where the fair value option has been elected.  Interest income is accrued on the principal balance of the loan based on the loan’s contractual interest rate.  Premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective yield method over the life of the loan.  Interest income and amortization of premiums and discounts are reported in net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) along with mortgage loan fees, which are recorded as they are incurred.

 

Our policy for commercial mortgage loans is to report loans that are 

60

 or more days past due, which equates to 

two

 or more payments missed, as delinquent.  Our policy for residential mortgage loans is to report loans that are 

90

 or more days past due, which equates to 

three

 or more payments missed, as delinquent.  We do not accrue interest on loans 

90

 days past due, and any interest received on these loans is either applied to the principal or recorded in net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) when received, depending on the assessment of the collectability of the loan.  We resume accruing interest once a loan complies with all of its original terms or restructured terms.  Mortgage loans deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are likewise credited to the allowance for credit losses.  Accrued interest on mortgage loans is written-off when deemed uncollectible.

 

In connection with our recognition of an allowance for credit losses for mortgage loans on real estate, we perform a quantitative analysis using a probability of default/loss given default/exposure at default approach to estimate expected credit losses in our mortgage loan portfolio as well as unfunded commitments related to commercial mortgage loans, exclusive of certain mortgage loans held at fair value.  Our model estimates expected credit losses over the contractual terms of the loans, which are the periods over which we are exposed to credit risk, adjusted for expected prepayments.  Credit loss estimates are segmented by commercial mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans, and unfunded commitments related to commercial mortgage loans.

 

The allowance for credit losses for pooled loans of similar risk (i.e., commercial and residential mortgage loans) is estimated using relevant historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions.  Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses with adjustments for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term lengths as well as adjustments for changes in environmental conditions, such as unemployment rates, property values, or other factors that management deems relevant.  We apply probability weights to the positive, base and adverse scenarios we use.

  For periods beyond our reasonable and supportable forecast, we use implicit mean reversion over the remaining life of the recoverable, meaning our model will inherently revert to the baseline scenario as the baseline is representative of the historical average over a longer period of time.

 

Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that, based upon current information and events, we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  When we determine that a loan is impaired, a specific credit loss allowance is established for the excess carrying value of the loan over its estimated value.  The loan’s estimated value is based on:  the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate; the loan’s observable market price; or the fair value of the loan’s collateral.

 

Allowance for credit losses are maintained at a level we believe is adequate to absorb current expected lifetime credit losses.  Our periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on historical loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of the underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future and other relevant factors.

Mortgage loans on real estate are presented net of the allowance for credit losses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in the allowance are reported in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Mortgage loans on real estate deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses, limited to the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.

 

Our commercial loan portfolio is primarily comprised of long-term loans secured by existing commercial real estate.  We believe all of the commercial loans in our portfolio share three primary risks:  borrower credit worthiness; sustainability of the cash flow of the property; and market risk; therefore, our methods of monitoring and assessing credit risk are consistent for our entire portfolio.

 

For our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, trends in market vacancy and rental rates are incorporated into the analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses.  In addition, we review each loan individually in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on an annual basis to identify emerging risks.  We focus on properties that experienced a reduction in debt-service coverage or that have significant exposure to tenants with deteriorating credit profiles.  Where warranted, we establish or increase a credit loss allowance for a specific loan based upon this analysis.  

 

We measure and assess the credit quality of our commercial mortgage loans by using loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios.  The loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value at origination of the underlying property collateralizing the loan and is commonly expressed as a percentage.  Loan-to-value ratios greater than 

100

% indicate that the principal amount is greater than the collateral value.  Therefore, all else being equal, a lower loan-to-value ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan.  The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt-service payments.  Debt-service coverage ratios of less than 

1.0

 indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover its current debt payments.  Therefore, all else being equal, a higher debt-service coverage ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan.  These credit quality metrics are monitored and reviewed at least annually.

 

Most of our off-balance sheet commitments relate to commercial mortgage loans.  As such, an allowance for credit losses is developed based on the commercial mortgage loan process outlined above, along with an internally developed conversion factor.

 

Our residential loan portfolio is primarily comprised of first lien mortgages secured by existing residential real estate.  In contrast to the commercial mortgage loan portfolio, residential mortgage loans are primarily smaller-balance homogenous loans that share similar risk characteristics.  Therefore, these pools of loans are collectively evaluated for inherent credit losses.  Such evaluations consider numerous factors, including, but not limited to borrower credit scores, collateral values, loss forecasts, geographic location, delinquency rates and economic trends.  These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, including updated forecasts, which can cause the allowance for credit losses to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised.  Generally, residential mortgage loan pools exclude loans that are nonperforming, as those loans are evaluated individually using the evaluation framework for specific allowance for credit losses described above.

 

For residential mortgage loans, our primary credit quality indicator is whether the loan is performing or nonperforming.  We generally define nonperforming residential mortgage loans as those that are 

90

 or more days past due and/or in nonaccrual status.  There is generally a higher risk of experiencing credit losses when a residential mortgage loan is nonperforming.  We monitor and update aging schedules and nonaccrual status on a monthly basis.

 

Policy Loans 

 

Policy loans represent loans we issue to contract holders that use the cash surrender value of their life insurance policy as collateral.  Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances.  

 

Real Estate

 

Real estate includes both real estate held for the production of income and real estate held-for-sale.  Real estate held for the production of income is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.  We periodically review properties held for the production of income for impairment.  Properties whose carrying values are greater than their projected undiscounted cash flows are written down to estimated fair value, with impairment losses reported in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The estimated fair value of real estate is generally computed using the present value of expected future cash flows from the real estate discounted at a rate commensurate with the underlying risks.  Real estate classified as held-for-sale is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less expected disposition costs at the time classified as held-for-sale.  Real estate is not depreciated while it is classified as held-for-sale.  Also, valuation allowances are established, as appropriate, for real estate held-for-sale and any changes to the valuation allowances are reported in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings is recorded at fair value at the settlement date.  

 

Derivative Instruments

 

We hedge certain portions of our exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk and credit risk by entering into derivative transactions.  All of our derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on our Consolidated

Balance Sheets at estimated fair value.  W

e categorized derivatives into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique as discussed above in “Fair Value Measurement.”  

The accounting for changes in the estimated fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged:  as a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge.

 

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects net income.  The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of designated future cash flows of the hedged item (hedge ineffectiveness), if any, is recognized in net income during the period of change.  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in net income during the period of change in estimated fair values.  For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, but that are economic hedges, the gain or loss is recognized in net income.

 

We purchase and issue financial instruments and products that contain embedded derivative instruments.  When it is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes.  The embedded derivative is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income during the period of change.  

 

We employ several different methods for determining the fair value of our derivative instruments.  The fair value of our derivative contracts are measured based on current settlement values, which are based on quoted market prices, industry standard models that are commercially available and broker quotes.  These techniques project cash flows of the derivatives using current and implied future market conditions.  We calculate the present value of the cash flows to measure the current fair market value of the derivative. 

 

Cash and Invested Cash

 

Cash and invested cash is carried at cost and includes all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less

DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL

 

Acquisition costs directly related to successful contract acquisitions or renewals of UL, VUL, traditional life insurance, annuities and other investment contracts have been deferred (i.e., DAC) to the extent recoverable.  VOBA is an intangible asset that reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the business in force at the acquisition date.  Bonus credits and excess interest for dollar cost averaging contracts are considered DSI.  Contract sales charges that are collected in the early years of an insurance contract are deferred (i.e., DFEL), and the unamortized balance is reported in other contract holder funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

 

Both DAC and VOBA amortization, excluding amounts reported in realized gain (loss), is reported within commissions and other expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  DSI amortization, excluding amounts reported in realized gain (loss), is reported in interest credited on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The amortization of DFEL, excluding amounts reported in realized gain (loss), is reported within fee income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The methodology for determining the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL varies by product type.  For all insurance contracts, amortization is based on assumptions consistent with those used in the development of the underlying contract adjusted for emerging experience and expected trends.  

 

Acquisition costs for UL and VUL insurance and investment-type products, which include fixed and variable deferred annuities, are generally amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) from surrender charges, investment, mortality net of reinsurance ceded and expense margins and actual realized gain (loss) on investments.  Contract lives for UL and VUL policies are estimated to be 

40

 years based on the expected lives of the contracts.  Contract lives for fixed and variable deferred annuities are generally between 

15

 and 

30

 years, while some of our fixed multi-year guarantee products have amortization periods equal to the guarantee period.  The front-end load annuity product has an assumed life of 

25

 years.  Longer lives are assigned to those blocks that have demonstrated lower lapse experience.  

 

Acquisition costs for all traditional contracts, including traditional life insurance contracts, such as individual whole life, group business and term life insurance, are amortized over the expected premium-paying period that generally results in amortization less than 

30

 years.  Acquisition costs are either amortized on a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related policies depending on the block of business.  There is currently no intangible balance or related amortization for fixed and variable payout annuities.

 

We account for modifications of insurance contracts that result in a substantially unchanged contract as a continuation of the replaced contract.  We account for modifications of insurance contracts that result in a substantially changed contract as an extinguishment of the replaced contract.

The carrying amounts of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL are adjusted for the effects of realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as fixed maturity AFS and certain derivatives and embedded derivatives

.  

Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses.  When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization within realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses.  These actual to expected amortization adjustments can create volatility from period to period in realized gain (loss).  

 

During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and the projection models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products.  These assumptions include, but are not limited to, capital markets, investment margins, mortality, retention, rider utilization and maintenance expenses (costs associated with maintaining records relating to insurance and individual and group annuity contracts, and with the processing of premium collections, deposits, withdrawals and commissions).  Based on our review, the cumulative balances of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are adjusted with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or amortization expense to reflect such change related to our expectations of future EGPs (“unlocking”).  We may have unlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating assumptions outside of our annual comprehensive review.  We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling refinements that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. 

 

DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL are reviewed to ensure that the unamortized portion does not exceed the expected recoverable amounts. 

 

Reinsurance

 

Our insurance subsidiaries enter into reinsurance agreements in the normal course of business to limit our exposure to the risk of loss and to enhance our capital management.

 

In order for a reinsurance agreement to qualify for reinsurance accounting, the agreement must satisfy certain risk transfer conditions that include, among other items, a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity.  When we apply reinsurance accounting, premiums, benefits and DAC amortization are reported net of insurance ceded on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Amounts currently recoverable, such as ceded reserves, are reported in reinsurance recoverables and amounts currently payable to the reinsurers, such as premiums, are included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses from certain reinsurance contracts that grant statutory surplus relief to our insurance companies are netted on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), respectively, if there is a contractual right of offset.    

 

We use deposit accounting to recognize reinsurance agreements that do not transfer significant insurance risk.  This accounting treatment results in amounts paid or received by our insurance subsidiaries to be considered on deposit with the reinsurer and such amounts are reported in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As amounts are paid or received, consistent with the underlying contracts, deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted.

 

We estimated an allowance for credit losses for all reinsurance recoverables and related reinsurance deposit assets held by our subsidiaries.  As such, we performed a quantitative analysis using a probability of loss approach to estimate expected credit losses for reinsurance recoverables, inclusive of similar assets recognized using the deposit method of accounting.  The credit loss allowance is a general allowance for pools of receivables with similar risk characteristics segmented by credit risk ratings and receivables assessed on an individual basis that do not share similar risk characteristics where we anticipate a credit loss over the life of reinsurance-related assets.

 

Our model uses relevant internal or external historical loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and conditions in developing our loss estimate.  We utilized historical credit rating data to form an estimation of probability of default of counterparties by means of a transition matrix that provides the rates of credit migration for credit ratings transitioning to impairment.  We updated reinsurer credit ratings during the quarter to incorporate the most up-to-date information on the current state of the financial stability of our reinsurers.  To simulate changes in economic conditions, we used positive, base and adverse scenarios that include varying levels of loss given default assumptions to reflect the impact of changes in severity of losses.  We applied probability weights to the positive, base and adverse scenarios.  For periods beyond our reasonable and supportable forecasts, we used implicit mean reversion over the remaining life of the recoverable.  Additionally, we considered factors that impact our exposure at default that are driven by actuarial expectations around term and mortality assumptions rather than being directly driven by market or economic environment. 

 

Our model estimates the expected credit losses over the life of the reinsurance asset.  Credit loss estimates are segmented based on counterparty credit risk.  Our modeling process utilizes counterparty credit ratings, collateral types and amounts, and term and run-off assumptions.  For reinsurance recoverables that do not share similar risk characteristics, we assessed on an individual basis to determine a specific credit loss allowance.

We estimated expected credit losses over the contractual term of the recoverable, which is the period during which we are exposed to the credit risk.  Reinsurance recoverables may not have explicit contractual lives, but are tied to the underlying insurance products; as a result, we estimated the contractual life by utilizing actuarial estimates of the timing of payouts related to those underlying products. 

 

Reinsurance agreements often require the reinsurer to collateralize the recoverable with funds in a trust account for the benefit of the ceding insurance entity that can reduce the expected credit losses on a given agreement.  As such, we review reinsurance collateral by individual agreement to sensitize risk of loss based on level of collateralization.  This review is driven by the assumption that non-collateralized reinsurance recoverables would have materially higher losses in time of default.  Therefore, reinsurance recoverables are pooled as either fully-collateralized or non-collateralized.

 

Reinsurance recoverables are presented net of the allowance for credit losses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in the allowance for credit losses are reported in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Reinsurance recoverables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses, limited to the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.

 

Goodwill

 

We recognize the excess of the purchase price, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired as goodwill.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  

 

We perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test where the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the reporting unit’s fair value, goodwill is impaired and written down to the reporting unit’s fair value; and a charge is reported in impairment of intangibles on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The results of one goodwill impairment test on one reporting unit cannot subsidize the results of another reporting unit. 

 

Other Assets and Other Liabilities

 

Other assets consist primarily of certain reinsurance assets, net of allowance for credit losses, specifically identifiable intangible assets, property and equipment owned by the Company, balances associated with corporate-owned and bank-owned life insurance, receivables resulting from sales of securities that had not yet settled as of the balance sheet date, DSI, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, finance lease assets, certain financing arrangements, debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements and other receivables and prepaid expenses.  Other liabilities consist primarily of certain reinsurance payables, current and deferred taxes, pension and other employee benefit liabilities, derivative instrument liabilities, payables resulting from purchases of securities that had not yet settled as of the balance sheet date, long-term operating lease liabilities, finance lease liabilities, certain financing arrangements, deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance and other accrued expenses.

 

Other assets and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) features and remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts that are carried at fair value, which may be reported in either other assets or other liabilities.  The fair value of these items represents approximate exit price including an estimate for our NPR.  Certain of these features have elements of both insurance benefits and embedded derivatives.  Through our hybrid accounting approach, for reserve calculation purposes we assign product cash flows to the embedded derivative or insurance portion of the reserves based on the life-contingent nature of the benefits.  We classify these GLB reserves embedded derivatives in Level 3 within the hierarchy levels described above in “Fair Value Measurement.”  We report the insurance portion of the reserves in future contract benefits. 

 

The carrying values of specifically identifiable intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for indicators of impairment in value that are related to credit loss or non-credit, including unexpected or adverse changes in the following:  the economic or competitive environments in which the company operates; profitability analyses; cash flow analyses; and the fair value of the relevant business operation.  If there was an indication of impairment, then the discounted cash flow method would be used to measure the impairment, and the carrying value would be adjusted as necessary and reported in impairment of intangibles on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  Sales force intangibles are attributable to the value of the new business distribution system acquired through business combinations.  These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life of 

25

 years.  Specifically identifiable intangible assets also includes the value of customer relationships acquired (“VOCRA”) and value of distribution agreements (“VODA”).  The carrying values of VOCRA and VODA are amortized using a straight-line basis over their weighted average life of 

20

 years and 

13

 years, respectively.  See Note 10 for more information regarding specifically identifiable intangible assets.

Property and equipment owned for company use is carried at cost less allowances for depreciation.  Provisions for depreciation of investment real estate and property and equipment owned for company use are computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which include buildings, computer hardware and software and other property and equipment.  Certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are related to finance leases and certain financing arrangements and are depreciated in a manner consistent with our current depreciation policy for owned assets.  We periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.  For long-lived assets to be held and used, impairments are recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

 

Long-lived assets to be disposed of by abandonment or in an exchange for a similar productive long-lived asset are classified as held-for-use until they are disposed.  Long-lived assets to be sold are classified as held-for-sale and are no longer depreciated.  Certain criteria have to be met in order for the long-lived asset to be classified as held-for-sale, including that a sale is probable and expected to occur within one year.  Long-lived assets classified as held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

 

We lease office space and certain equipment under various long-term lease agreements.  We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date.  Our leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, we use our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.  The ROU asset is calculated using the lease liability carrying amount, plus or minus prepaid/accrued lease payments, minus the unamortized balance of lease incentives received, plus unamortized initial direct costs.  Lease terms used to calculate our lease obligation include options when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.  Our lease agreements may contain both lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.  Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

Other liabilities includes a deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance attributable to a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc (“Swiss Re”) effective January 1, 2020.  We are recognizing the gain related to this transaction over the period over which the majority of account values are expected to run off, or 

15

 years.

 

Other liabilities includes a deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance attributable to our annuity reinsurance agreement with Athene Holding Ltd. (“Athene”) effective October 1, 2018.  We are recognizing the gain related to this transaction over the period over which the majority of account values are expected to run off, or 

20

 years.

 

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities

 

We maintain separate account assets, which are reported at fair value.  The related liabilities are reported at an amount equivalent to the separate account assets.  Investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by the contract holders, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain accounts.  

 

We issue variable annuity contracts through our separate accounts for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contract holder (traditional variable annuities).  We also issue variable annuity and life contracts through separate accounts that may include various types of guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”), guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) and guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features.  The GDB features include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder either:  return of no less than total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net deposits”); total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (“minimum return”); or the highest contract value on any contract anniversary date through age 80.  The highest contract value is increased by purchase payments and is decreased by withdrawals subsequent to that anniversary date in the same proportion that withdrawals reduce the contract value.

 

As discussed in Note 6, certain features of these guarantees are accounted for as embedded derivative reserves, whereas other guarantees are accounted for as benefit reserves.  Other guarantees contain characteristics of both and are accounted for under an approach that calculates the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature.  We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for living benefits in certain of our variable annuity products.  The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in the value of the associated reserves.  The net impact of these changes is reported as a component of realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The “market consistent scenarios” used in the determination of the fair value of the GLB liability are similar to those used by an investment bank to value derivatives for which the pricing is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid.  We use risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulations in our calculation to value the entire block of guarantees, which involve 

100

 unique scenarios per policy or approximately 

47

 million scenarios.  The market consistent scenario assumptions, as of each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant.  The market consistent inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions for capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, rider utilization, etc.), mortality, risk margins, maintenance expenses and a margin for profit.  We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop we will continue to reassess our assumptions.  It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.

 

Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Funds

 

Future contract benefits represent liability reserves that we have established and carry based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims.  Other contract holder funds represent liabilities for fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, dividends payable, premium deposit funds, undistributed earnings on participating business and other contract holder funds as well as the carrying value of DFEL discussed above.

 

The liabilities for future contract benefits and claim reserves for UL and VUL insurance policies consist of contract account balances that are equal to deposits net of withdrawals, excluding surrender charges and fees, plus interest credited, and if applicable an additional reserve for other insurance benefit guarantees.  The liabilities for future insurance contract benefits and claim reserves for traditional life policies are computed using assumptions for investment yields, mortality and withdrawals based principally on generally accepted actuarial methods and assumptions at the time of contract issue.  Investment yield assumptions for traditional direct individual life reserves for all contracts range from 

2.25

% to 

7.75

% depending on the time of contract issue.  The investment yield assumptions for immediate and deferred paid-up annuities range from 

1.25

% to 

12.75

%.  These investment yield assumptions are intended to represent an estimation of the interest rate experience for the period that these contract benefits are payable.

 

The liabilities for future claim reserves for variable annuity products containing GDB features are calculated by estimating the present value of total expected benefit payments over the life of the contract from inception divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract (“benefit ratio”) multiplied by the cumulative assessments recorded from the contract inception through the balance sheet date less the cumulative GDB payments plus interest on the liability.  The change in the liability for a period is the benefit ratio multiplied by the assessments recorded for the period less GDB claims paid in the period plus interest.  As experience or assumption changes result in a change in expected benefit payments or assessments, the benefit ratio is unlocked, that is, recalculated using the updated expected benefit payments and assessments over the life of the contract since inception.  The revised benefit ratio is then applied to the liability calculation described above, with the resulting change in liability reported in benefits on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 

The liability for future claim reserves for long-term disability contracts for incurred and reported claims are calculated based on assumptions as to interest, claim resolution rates and offsets for other insurance including social security.  Claim resolution rate assumptions and social security offsets are based on our actual experience.  The interest rate assumptions used for discounting claim reserves are based on projected portfolio yield rates, after consideration for defaults and investment expenses, for assets supporting the liabilities.  The incurred but not reported claim reserves are based on our experiences as to the reporting lags and ultimate loss experience.  Claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change.  Claim reserves do not include a provision for adverse deviation. 

 

With respect to our 

future contract benefits and other contract holder funds

, we continually review overall reserve position, reserving techniques and reinsurance arrangements.  As experience develops and new information becomes known, liabilities are adjusted as deemed necessary.  The effects of changes in estimates are included in the operating results for the period in which such changes occur.

 

The business written or assumed by us includes participating life insurance contracts, under which the contract holder is entitled to share in the earnings of such contracts via receipt of dividends.  The dividend scale for participating policies is reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect recent experience and future expectations.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, participating policies comprised less than 

1

% of the face amount of business in force, and dividend expenses were $

53

 million, $

51

 million and $

56

 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 

Liabilities for the secondary guarantees on UL-type products are calculated by multiplying the benefit ratio by the cumulative assessments recorded from contract inception through the balance sheet date less the cumulative secondary guarantee benefit payments plus interest.  If experience or assumption changes result in a new benefit ratio, the reserves are adjusted to reflect the changes in a manner similar to the unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and DSI.  The accounting for secondary guarantee benefits impacts, and is impacted by, EGPs used to calculate amortization of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and DSI.

Certain of our variable annuity contracts reported within future contract benefits contain GLB reserves embedded derivatives, a portion of which may be reported in either other assets or other liabilities, and include guaranteed interest and similar contracts, that are carried at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents approximate exit price including an estimate for our NPR.  Certain of these features have elements of both insurance benefits and embedded derivatives.  Through our hybrid accounting approach, for reserve calculation purposes we assign product cash flows to the embedded derivative or insurance portion of the reserves based on the life-contingent nature of the benefits.  We classify these GLB reserves embedded derivatives items in Level 3 within the hierarchy levels described above in “Fair Value Measurement.”  We report the insurance portion of the reserves in future contract benefits. 

 

The fair value of our indexed annuity contracts is based on their approximate surrender values.

 

Short-term and Long-term Debt

 

Short-term debt has contractual or expected maturities of one year or less.  Long-term debt has contractual or expected maturities greater than one year.

 

Contingencies and Commitments

 

Contingencies arising from environmental remediation costs, regulatory judgments, claims, assessments, guarantees, litigation, recourse reserves, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when deemed probable and reasonably estimable.

 

Fee Income

 

Fee income for investment and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts consists of asset-based fees, percent of premium charges, contract administration charges and surrender charges that are assessed against contract holder account balances.  Investment products consist primarily of individual and group variable and fixed deferred annuities.  Interest-sensitive life insurance products include UL insurance, VUL insurance and other interest-sensitive life insurance policies.  These products include life insurance sold to individuals, corporate-owned life insurance and bank-owned life insurance.  

 

In bifurcating the embedded derivative of our GLB features on our variable annuity products, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relate to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”), which are not reported within fee income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit and are reported within realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 

The timing of revenue recognition as it relates to fees assessed on investment contracts is determined based on the nature of such fees.  Asset-based fees and contract administration charges are assessed on a daily or monthly basis and recognized as revenue as performance obligations are met, over the period underlying customer assets are owned or advisory services are provided.  Wholesaling-related 12b-1 fees received from separate account fund sponsors as compensation for servicing the underlying mutual funds are recorded as revenues based on a contractual percentage of the market value of mutual fund assets over the period shares are owned by customers.  Net investment advisory fees related to asset management of certain separate account funds are recorded as revenues based on a contractual percentage of the customer’s managed assets over the period advisory services are provided.  Percent of premium charges are assessed at the time of premium payment and recognized as revenue when assessed and earned.  Certain amounts assessed that represent compensation for services to be provided in future periods are reported as unearned revenue and recognized in income over the periods benefited.  Surrender charges are recognized upon surrender of a contract by the contract holder in accordance with contractual terms.  For investment and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts, the amounts collected from contract holders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue.

 

Insurance Premiums

 

Our insurance premiums for traditional life insurance and group insurance products are recognized as revenue when due from the contract holder.  Our traditional life insurance products include those products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist primarily of whole life insurance, limited-payment life insurance, term life insurance and certain annuities with life contingencies.  Our group insurance products consist primarily of term life, disability and dental.

 

Net Investment Income

 

We earn investment income on the underlying general account investments supporting our fixed products less related expenses.  Dividends and interest income, recorded in net investment income, are recognized when earned.  Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investments in debt securities are reflected in net investment income over the contractual terms of the investments in a manner that produces a constant effective yield.  

 




127

Table of Contents

 




 

For CLOs and MBS, included in the trading and fixed maturity AFS securities portfolios, we recognize income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities.  When actual prepayments differ significantly from originally anticipated prepayments, the retrospective effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and a catch up adjustment is recorded in the current period.  In addition, the new effective yield, which reflects anticipated future payments, is used prospectively.  Any adjustments resulting from changes in effective yield are reflected in net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 

Realized Gain (Loss)

 

Realized gain (loss) includes realized gains and losses from the sale of investments, write-downs for impairments of investments and changes in the allowance for credit losses for financial assets, changes in fair value for mortgage loans on real estate accounted for under the fair value option, changes in fair value of equity securities, certain derivative and embedded derivative gains and losses, gains and losses on the sale of subsidiaries and businesses and net gains and losses on reinsurance embedded derivatives and trading securities.  Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined using the specific identification method.  Realized gain (loss) is recognized in net income, net of associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.  Realized gain (loss) is also net of allocations of investment gains and losses to certain contract holders and certain funds withheld on reinsurance arrangements for which we have a contractual obligation.  

 

Other Revenues 

 

Other revenues consists primarily of fees attributable to broker-dealer services recorded as performance obligations are met, either at the time of sale or over time based on a contractual percentage of customer account values, changes in the market value of our seed capital investments, and proceeds from reinsurance recaptures.  The broker-dealer services primarily relate to our retail sales network and consist of commission revenue for the sale of non-affiliated securities recorded on a trade date basis and advisory fee income.  Advisory fee income is asset-based revenues recorded as earned based on a contractual percentage of customer account values.  Other revenues earned by our Group Protection segment consist of fees from administrative services performed, which are recognized as performance obligations are met over the terms of the underlying agreements.

 

Interest Credited

 

We credit interest to our contract holder account balances based on the contractual terms supporting our products.

 

Benefits

 

Benefits for UL and other interest-sensitive life insurance products include benefit claims incurred during the period in excess of contract account balances.  Benefits also include the change in reserves for life insurance products with secondary guarantee benefits, annuity products with guaranteed death and living benefits and certain annuities with life contingencies.  For traditional life, group health and disability income products, benefits are recognized when incurred in a manner consistent with the related premium recognition policies.

 

 

Strategic Digitization Expense

 

Strategic digitization expense consists primarily of costs related to our enterprise-wide digitization initiative.

 

 

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

 

Pursuant to the accounting rules for our obligations to employees and agents under our various pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we are required to make a number of assumptions to estimate related liabilities and expenses.  The mortality assumption is based on actual and anticipated plan experience, determined using acceptable actuarial methods.  We use assumptions for the weighted-average discount rate and expected return on plan assets to estimate pension expense.  The discount rate assumptions are determined using an analysis of current market information and the projected benefit flows associated with these plans.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected future rates of return on the funds invested in the plan.  The calculation of our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation also uses an assumption of weighted-average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate.

Stock-Based Compensation

 

In general, we expense the fair value of stock awards included in our incentive compensation plans.  As of the date our stock awards are approved, the fair value of stock options is determined using a Black-Scholes options valuation methodology, and the fair value of other stock awards is based upon the market value of the stock.  The fair value of the awards is expensed over the performance or service period, which generally corresponds to the vesting period, and is recognized as an increase to common stock in stockholders’ equity.  We apply an estimated forfeiture rate to our accrual of compensation cost.  We classify certain stock awards as liabilities.  For these awards, the settlement value is classified as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the liability is marked-to-market through net income at the end of each reporting period. Stock-based compensation expense is reflected in commissions and other expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 

 

Interest and Debt Expense

 

Interest expense on our short-term and long-term debt is recognized as due and any associated premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs are amortized (accreted) over the term of the related borrowing utilizing the effective interest method.  In addition, gains or losses related to certain derivative instruments associated with debt are recognized in interest and debt expense during the period of the change.

 

Income Taxes

 

We file a U.S. consolidated income tax return that includes all of our eligible subsidiaries.  Ineligible subsidiaries file separate individual corporate tax returns.  Subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable foreign statutes.  Deferred income taxes are recognized, based on enacted rates, when assets and liabilities have different values for financial statement and tax reporting purposes.  A valuation allowance is recorded to the extent required.  Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and, if so, the amount of such valuation allowance.  In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including:  the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. 

 

Foreign Currency Translation

 

The balance sheet accounts and income statement items of foreign subsidiaries, reported in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the current and average exchange rates for the year, respectively.  Resulting translation adjustments and other translation adjustments for foreign currency transactions that affect cash flows are reported in AOCI, a component of stockholders’ equity.

 

Earnings Per Share

 

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the average common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is computed assuming the conversion or exercise of dilutive convertible preferred securities, nonvested stock, stock options, performance share units and warrants outstanding during the year.  

 

Our deferred compensation plans allow participants the option to diversify from LNC stock to other investment alternatives.  When calculating our weighted-average dilutive shares, we presume the investment option will be settled in cash and exclude these shares from our calculation, unless the effect of settlement in shares would be more dilutive to our diluted EPS calculation.  

 

For any period where a net loss is experienced, shares used in the diluted EPS calculation represent basic shares, as the use of diluted shares would result in a lower loss per share.

  New Accounting Standards

 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

 

The following table provides a description of our adoption of new Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) issued by the FASB and the impact of the adoption on our financial statements.  ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or insignificant in presentation or amount.

ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and related amendments

These amendments adopt a new model in ASC Topic 326 to measure and recognize credit losses for most financial assets.  The ASU requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the asset using a credit loss allowance. Changes in the allowance are charged to earnings.  The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial asset.  The method used to measure estimated credit losses for fixed maturity AFS securities will be unchanged from current GAAP; however, the amendments require credit losses to be recognized through an allowance rather than as a reduction to the amortized cost of those securities.  The amendments permit entities to recognize improvements in credit loss estimates on fixed maturity AFS securities by reducing the allowance account immediately through earnings.  The amendments are adopted through a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of the first reporting period in which the amendments are effective.  Early adoption was permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.

January 1, 2020

The adoption of this standard and related amendments resulted in the recognition of a cumulative effect decrease of $

218

 million, net of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds, after-tax, to retained earnings.  The overall adjustment recorded our allowance for credit losses as of the date of adoption, primarily related to commercial and residential mortgage loans, as well as reinsurance recoverables.  Upon adoption of the standard, the concept of other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) no longer exists; however, our prior period presentation herein is reflective of OTTI recorded in those periods.

ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging and Topic 825, Financial Instruments

These amendments clarify the measurement, recognition and presentation of the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable balances; the inclusion of recoveries when estimating the allowance for credit losses; the inclusion of all ASC Topic 944 – 

Financial Services – Insurance

 reinsurance recoverables within the scope of ASC 326-20; and provide additional targeted clarifications on the calculation of the allowance for credit losses.

‎

‎

These amendments also make targeted clarifications to ASC Topics 815 and 825.  Early adoption was permitted.

January 1, 2020

Our adoption of ASU 2016-13 and related amendments is discussed above.  The adoption of the remainder of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief

The amendments provide entities that have certain instruments within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, 

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost

, with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in Subtopic 825-10, 

Financial Instruments – Overall

, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of ASC Topic 326. 

January 1, 2020

We recognized a cumulative effect increase to retained earnings of $

15

 million, after-tax, by electing the fair value option for certain mortgage loans in connection with our adoption of ASC Topic 326.  

ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)

The amendments in this update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting.  The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions impacted by reference rate reform.  If certain criteria are met, an entity will not be required to remeasure or reassess contracts impacted by reference rate reform.  Additionally, changes to the critical terms of a hedging relationship affected by reference rate reform will not require entities to de-designate the relationship if certain requirements are met.  The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, with certain exceptions.  The amendments are effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020, and December 31, 2022.  

March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022

This standard may be elected and applied prospectively as reference rate reform unfolds.  We have begun our implementation and are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

ASU 2018-12, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and related amendments

These amendments make changes to the accounting and reporting for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity that will significantly change how insurers account for long-duration contracts, including how they measure, recognize and make disclosures about insurance liabilities and DAC.  Under this ASU, insurers will be required to review cash flow assumptions at least annually and update them if necessary.  They also will have to make quarterly updates to the discount rate assumptions they use to measure the liability for future policyholder benefits.  The ASU creates a new category of market risk benefits (i.e., features that protect the contract holder from capital market risk and expose the insurer to that risk) that insurers will have to measure at fair value.  The ASU provides various transition methods by topic that entities may elect upon adoption.  The ASU is currently effective January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted.  

January 1, 2023

We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

.  Acquisition

 

On 

May 1, 2018

, we completed the acquisition from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company of 

100

% of the capital stock of Liberty Life, an operator of a group benefits business (the “Liberty Group Business”) and an individual life and individual and group annuity business (the “Liberty Life Business”).  The acquisition expanded the scale and capabilities of the Group Protection business while further diversifying the Company’s sources of earnings.  Effective September 1, 2019, Liberty Life’s name was changed to Lincoln Life Assurance Company of Boston (“LLACB”).

 

In connection with the acquisition and pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement (“MTA”), dated January 18, 2018, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 10-K, Liberty Life sold the Liberty Life Business on May 1, 2018, by entering into reinsurance agreements and related ancillary documents (including administrative services agreements and transition services agreements) with Protective Life Insurance Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Protective Life and Annuity Insurance Company (together with Protective Life Insurance Company, “Protective”), providing for the reinsurance and administration of the Liberty Life Business.

 

We recognized $

85

 million of acquisition-related costs, pre-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018.  These costs were included in commissions and other expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 

Since the acquisition date of May 1, 2018, the revenues and net income of the business acquired have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Group Protection segment and were $

1.5

 billion and $

36

 million, respectively, for the period ended December 31, 2018.   

 

4.  Variable Interest Entities 

 

Consolidated VIEs

 

Reinsurance Related Notes

 

We are the sole equity owner of Lincoln Financial Limited Liability Company I (“LFLLCI”), which we formed in July 2013.  The activities of LFLLCI relate solely to our captive reinsurance subsidiary, the Lincoln Reinsurance Company of Vermont V (“LRCVV”), and are primarily to acquire, hold and issue notes with LRCVV as well as pay and collect interest on the notes.  LFLLCI holds a surplus note issued by LRCVV that had an outstanding principal balance of $

611

 million as of December 31, 2020.  LFLLCI issued a long-term note to LRCVV that has a principal balance that moves concurrently with any variability in the face amount of the surplus note LFLLCI received from LRCVV.  We concluded that LFLLCI is a VIE and that LNC is the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the most significant activities affecting the performance of LFLLCI.

Unconsolidated VIEs

 

Reinsurance Related Notes

 

Effective September 30, 2014, we entered into a transaction with a non-affiliated VIE whose primary activities are to acquire, hold and issue notes and loans, pay and collect interest on the notes and loans, and enter into derivative instruments.  We issued a long-term senior note to the non-affiliated VIE in exchange for a corporate bond AFS security of like principal and duration that was assigned to one of our subsidiaries.  The outstanding principal balance of this long-term senior note was $

963

 million as of December 31, 2020, and it is variable in nature; moving concurrently with any variability in the face amount of the corporate bond AFS security up to a maximum amount of $

1.1

 billion.  We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of the non-affiliated VIE because we do not have power over the activities that most significantly affect its economic performance.  In addition, the terms of the senior note provide us with a set-off right with the corporate bond AFS security we purchased from the VIE; therefore, neither appears on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The VIE has entered into a total return swap with an unaffiliated third party that supports any necessary principal funding of the corporate bond AFS security required by our subsidiaries while the security is outstanding.

Effective October 1, 2017, our captive reinsurance subsidiary, the Lincoln Reinsurance Company of Vermont VI, restructured the $

275

 million, long-term surplus note which was originally issued to a non-affiliated VIE in October 2015 in exchange for two corporate bond AFS securities of like principal and duration.  The activities of the VIE are primarily to acquire, hold and issue notes and loans and to pay and collect interest on the notes and loans.  The outstanding principal balance of the long-term surplus note is variable in nature; moving concurrently with any variability in the face amount of the corporate bond AFS securities.  We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of the non-affiliated VIE because we do not have power over the activities that most significantly affect its economic performance.  As of December 31, 2020, the principal balance of the long-term surplus note was 

zero

 and we do 

no

t currently have any exposure to this VIE.

 

Effective November 1, 2019, we entered into a transaction with a non-affiliated VIE whose primary activities are to acquire, hold and issue notes, as well as pay and collect interest on the notes.  We issued a long-term senior note to the non-affiliated VIE in exchange for a corporate bond AFS security of like principal and duration that was assigned to one of our subsidiaries.  The outstanding principal balance of this long-term senior note was $

359

 million as of December 31, 2020, and it is variable in nature, moving concurrently with any variability in the face amount of the corporate bond AFS security up to a maximum amount of $

500

 million.  We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of the non-affiliated VIE due to our lack of power over the activities that most significantly affect its economic performance as well as the extent of our obligation to absorb its losses.  In addition, the terms of the senior note provide us with a set-off right with the corporate bond AFS security we purchased from the VIE; therefore, neither appears on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 

Structured Securities

 

Through our investment activities, we make passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which we are not the manager.  These structured securities include our ABS, RMBS and CMBS.  We have not provided financial or other support with respect to these VIEs other than our original investment.  We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs due to the relative size of our investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs and the level of credit subordination that reduces our obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits.  Our maximum exposure to loss on these structured securities is limited to the amortized cost for these investments.  We recognize our variable interest in these VIEs at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  For information about these structured securities, see Note 5.

 

Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies

 

We invest in certain LPs and limited liability companies (“LLCs”), including qualified affordable housing projects, that we have concluded are VIEs.  We do not hold any substantive kick-out or participation rights in the LPs and LLCs, and we do not receive any performance fees or decision maker fees from the LPs and LLCs.  Based on our analysis of the LPs and LLCs, we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the LPs and LLCs.

 

The carrying amounts of our investments in the LPs and LLCs are recognized in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $

2.1

 billion and $

1.9

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Included in these carrying amounts are our investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which were $

7

 million and $

13

 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  We do not have any contingent commitments to provide additional capital funding to these qualified affordable housing projects.  We receive returns from these qualified affordable housing projects in the form of income tax credits and other tax benefits, which are recognized in federal income tax expense (benefit) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and were $

1

 million and $

2

 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 

Our exposure to loss is limited to the capital we invest in the LPs and LLCs, and there have been no indicators of impairment that would require us to recognize an impairment loss related to the LPs and LLCs as of December 31, 2020.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, we recognized the OTTI attributed to noncredit factors as a separate component in OCI referred to as unrealized OTTI on fixed maturity AFS securities.  This includes unrealized (gains) and losses on credit-impaired securities related to changes in the fair value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date.

Our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity AFS securities decreased by $

45

 million for the year ended 

December 

31, 2020.  As discussed further below, we believe the unrealized loss position as of 

December 

31, 2020, did not require an impairment recognized in earnings as (i) we did not intend to sell these fixed maturity AFS securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (iii) the difference in the fair value compared to the amortized cost was due to factors other than credit loss.  Based upon this evaluation as of Dece

mber 

31, 2020, management believes we have the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations (e.g., insurance premiums, fee income and investment income) to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety without requiring the sale of our impaired securities. 

 

As of 

December

 31, 2020, the unrealized losses associated with our corporate bond, U.S. government bond, state and municipal bond and foreign government bond securities were attributable primarily to widening credit spreads and rising interest rates since purchase.  We performed a detailed analysis of the financial performance of the underlying issuers and determined that we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each impaired security.

 

Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security.  Securities rated investment grade (those rated BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) or Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”)) are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk.  As of 

December

 31, 2020 and 2019, 

96

% of the fair value of our corporate bond portfolio was rated investment grade.  As of 

December

 31, 2020 and 2019, the portion of our corporate bond portfolio rated below investment grade had an amortized cost of $

4.1

 billion and $

3.2

 billion, respectively, and a fair value of $

4.2

 billion and $

3.3

 billion, respectively.  Based upon the analysis discussed above, we believe that as of 

December

 31, 2020 and 2019, we would have recovered the amortized cost of each corporate bond.

 

As of 

December

 31, 2020, the unrealized losses associated with our MBS and ABS were attributable primarily to widening credit spreads and rising interest rates since purchase.  We assessed for credit impairment using a cash flow model that incorporates key assumptions including default rates, severities and prepayment rates.  We estimated losses for a security by forecasting the underlying loans in each transaction.  The forecasted loan performance was used to project cash flows to the various tranches in the structure, as applicable.  Our forecasted cash flows also considered, as applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts and other independent market data.  Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses of the security given the performance of the underlying collateral compared to our subordination or other credit enhancement, we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each impaired security.

 

As of 

December

 31, 2020, the unrealized losses associated with our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities were attributable primarily to wider credit spreads caused by illiquidity in the market and subordination within the capital structure, as well as credit risk of underlying issuers.  For our hybrid and redeemable preferred securities, we evaluated the financial performance of the underlying issuers based upon credit performance and investment ratings and determined that we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each impaired security.

 

Credit Loss Impairment on Fixed Maturity AFS Securities

 

We regularly review our fixed maturity AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be impairment-related, including those attributable to credit risk factors that may require an allowance for credit losses.  See Note 1 for a detailed discussion regarding our accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses on our fixed maturity AFS securities.

Credit Losses on Mortgage Loans on Real Estate

 

In connection with our recognition of an allowance for credit losses for mortgage loans on real estate, we perform a quantitative analysis using a probability of default/loss given default/exposure at default approach to estimate expected credit losses in our mortgage loan portfolio as well as unfunded commitments related to commercial mortgage loans, exclusive of certain mortgage loans held at fair value.  See Note 1 for a detailed discussion regarding our accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses on our mortgage loans on real estate.

 

Changes in the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans on real estate (in millions) were as follows:

See Note 6 for additional information. 

(2)

Our pledged securities under securities lending agreements are included in fixed maturity AFS securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We generally obtain collateral in an amount equal to 

102

% and 

105

% of the fair value of the domestic and foreign securities, respectively.  We value collateral daily and obtain additional collateral when deemed appropriate.  The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash and invested cash or fixed maturity AFS securities.

% of the fair value for mortgage loans on real estate.  The cash received in these transactions is primarily invested in cash and invested cash or fixed maturity AFS securities.

 

We have repurchase agreements through which we can obtain liquidity by pledging securities.  The collateral requirements are generally 

80

% to 

95

% of the fair value of the securities, and our agreements with third parties contain contractual provisions to allow for additional collateral to be obtained when necessary.  The cash received in our repurchase program is typically invested in fixed maturity AFS securities.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were not participating in any open repurchase agreements.

6.  Derivative Instruments

 

We maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, basis risk and credit risk.  We assess these risks by continually identifying and monitoring changes in our exposures that may adversely affect expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities.  

 

Derivative activities are monitored by various management committees.  The committees are responsible for overseeing the implementation of various hedging strategies that are developed through the analysis of financial simulation models and other internal and industry sources.  The resulting hedging strategies are incorporated into our overall risk management strategies.    

 

See Note 1 for a detailed discussion of the accounting treatment for derivative instruments.  See Note 21 for additional disclosures related to the fair value of our derivative instruments and Note 4 for derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs.

 

Interest Rate Contracts

 

We use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.  These instruments are economic hedges unless otherwise noted and include:

 

Forward-Starting Interest Rate Swaps

 

We use forward-starting interest rate swaps designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to the forecasted purchases of certain assets and anticipated issuances of fixed-rate securities.  

 

We also use forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate exposure within our life products related to the forecasted purchases of certain assets.

Table of Contents

 




 

Interest Rate Cap Corridor

s

 

We use interest rate cap corridors to provide a level of protection from the effect of rising interest rates for certain life insurance products and annuity contracts.  Interest rate cap corridors involve purchasing an interest rate cap at a specific cap rate and selling an interest rate cap with a higher cap rate.  For each corridor, the amount of quarterly payments, if any, is determined by the rate at which the underlying index rate resets above the original capped rate.  The corridor limits the benefit the purchaser can receive as the related interest rate index rises above the higher capped rate.  There is no additional liability to us other than the purchase price associated with the interest rate cap corridor. 

 

Interest Rate Futures

 

We use interest

 rate futures contracts to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.  These futures contracts require payment between our counterparty and us on a daily basis for changes in the futures index price.

 

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

 

We use interest rate swap agreements to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.

 

We also use interest rate swap agreements designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to hedge the interest rate risk of floating-rate bond coupon payments by replicating a fixed-rate bond. 

 

Finally, we use interest rate swap agreements designated and qualifying as fair value hedges to hedge against changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate long-term debt and fixed maturity securities due to interest rate risks. 

 

Treasury and Reverse Treasury Locks

 

We use treasury locks designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our issuance of fixed-rate securities or the anticipated future cash flows of floating-rate fixed maturity securities due to changes in interest rates.  In addition, we use reverse treasury locks designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the anticipated purchase of fixed-rate securities or the anticipated future cash flows of floating-rate fixed maturity securities due to changes in interest rates.  These derivatives are primarily structured to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain liabilities.  

 

Foreign Currency Contracts

 

We use derivative instruments as part of our foreign currency risk management strategy.  These instruments are economic hedges unless otherwise noted and include:  

 

Currency Futures

 

We use currency futures to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with certain options in variable annuity products.  Currency futures exchange one currency for another at a specified date in the future at a specified exchange rate. 

 

Foreign Currency Swaps

 

We use foreign currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange risk of investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies.  A foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange one currency for another at specified dates in the future at a specified exchange rate. 

 

We also use foreign currency swaps designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to hedge foreign exchange risk of investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies. 

 

Foreign Currency Forwards 

 

We use foreign currency forwards to hedge foreign exchange risk of investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in foreign currencies.  A foreign currency forward is a contractual agreement to exchange one currency for another at specified dates in the future at a specified current exchange rate.

Equity Market Contracts

 

We use derivative instruments as part of our equity market risk management strategy that are economic hedges and include:  

 

Call Options Based on the S&P 500

® 

Index and Other Indices

 

We use call options to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products. 

 

Our indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect an interest rate return or an equity market component, where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500 Index or other indices.  Contract holders may elect to rebalance index options at renewal dates. At the end of each indexed term, which can be up to 

six years

, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by establishing participation rates, caps, spreads and specified rates, subject to contractual guarantees. We use call options that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset period.  

 

Consumer Price Index Swaps

 

We use consumer price index swaps to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in fixed annuity products.  Consumer price index swaps are contracts entered into at no cost and whose payoff is the difference between the consumer price index inflation rate and the fixed-rate determined as of inception.

 

Equity Futures

 

We use equity futures contracts to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.  These futures contracts require payment between our counterparty and us on a daily basis for changes in the futures index price.

 

Put Options

 

We use put options to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products.  Put options are contracts that require counterparties to pay us at a specified future date the amount, if any, by which a specified equity index is less than the strike rate stated in the agreement, applied to a notional amount. 

 

Total Return Swaps

 

We use total return swaps to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products. 

 

In addition, we use total return swaps to hedge a portion of the liability related to our deferred compensation plans.  We receive the total return on a portfolio of indexes and pay a floating-rate of interest.  

 

Credit Contracts

 

We use derivative instruments as part of our credit risk management strategy that are economic hedges and include:  

 

Credit Default Swaps – Buying Protection

 

We use credit default swaps to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products. 

 

We buy credit default swaps to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers.  A credit default swap allows us to put the bond back to the counterparty at par upon a default event by the bond issuer.  A default event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation acceleration or restructuring. 

 

Credit Default Swaps – Selling Protection

 

We use credit default swaps to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products. 

 

We sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to contract holders and investors.  The credit default swaps hedge the contract holders and investors against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers.  A credit default swap allows the investor to put the bond back to us at par upon a default event by the bond issuer.  A default event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation acceleration or restructuring.

Embedded Derivatives

 

We have embedded derivatives that include:

 

GLB Reserves Embedded Derivatives

 

Certain features of these guarantees have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC (“benefit reserves”) and embedded derivatives accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“embedded derivative reserves”).  We calculate the value of the benefit reserves and the embedded derivative reserves based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. 

 

We use a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and volatility associated with GLBs offered in our variable annuity products, including products with guaranteed withdrawal benefit and guaranteed income benefit features.  Changes in the value of the hedge contracts due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities hedge the income statement effect of changes in embedded derivative GLB reserves caused by those same factors.  We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed. While we actively manage our hedge positions, these hedge positions may not be totally effective in offsetting changes in the embedded derivative reserve due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets and interest rates, market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments and our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off.   

 

Indexed Annuity and IUL Contracts Embedded Derivatives

 

Our indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect an interest rate return or an equity market component, where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500® Index or other indices.  Contract holders may elect to rebalance index options at renewal dates. At the end of each indexed term, which can be up to 

six years

, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by establishing participation rates, caps, spreads and specified rates, subject to contractual guarantees.  We use options that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset period. 

 

Reinsurance Related Embedded Derivatives

 

We have certain Modco and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements with embedded derivatives related to the withheld assets of the related funds.  These derivatives are considered total return swaps with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements.

As of December 31, 2020, $

13

 million of the deferred net gains (losses) on derivative instruments in AOCI were expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months.  This reclassification would be due primarily to interest rate variances related to our interest rate swap agreements.

 

For the years ended 

December 31, 2020

 and 2019, there were 

no

 material reclassifications to earnings due to hedged firm commitments no longer deemed probable or due to hedged forecasted transactions that had not occurred by the end of the originally specified time period.

Certain of our credit default swap agreements contain contractual provisions that allow for the netting of collateral with our counterparties related to all of our collateralized financing transactions that we have outstanding.

 

If these netting agreements were not in place, our counterparties would have been required to post $

1

 million of collateral as of December 31, 2020.

 

Credit Risk

 

We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on various derivative contracts and reflect assumptions regarding the credit or NPR.  

The NPR is based upon assumptions for each counterparty’s credit spread over the estimated weighted average life of the counterparty exposure, less collateral held. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the NPR adjustment was 

zero

.  The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by entering into agreements with financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records.  Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement.  We are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating ISDA agreements.  Under some ISDA agreements, our insurance subsidiaries have agreed to maintain certain financial strength or claims-paying ratings.  A downgrade below these levels could result in termination of derivative contracts, at which time any amounts payable by us would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts.  In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have entered into a credit support annex requiring either party to post collateral when net exposures exceed pre-determined thresholds.  These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating.  The amount of such exposure is essentially the net replacement cost or market value less collateral held for such agreements with each counterparty if the net market value is in our favor.  We did 

no

t have any exposure as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.

 million tax benefit from the impact of the reduced corporate tax rate under the Tax Act on our election to revalue policyholder tax reserves.  In 2020, we recognized a $

37

 million tax benefit attributable to the carry back of a 2020 net operating loss under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which provides for a five-year carryback period

As of December 31, 2020, we have $

1.0

 billion of net operating losses to carry forward to future years.  The net operating losses arose in tax year 2018, and under the Tax Act changes, have an unlimited carryforward period.  As a result, management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset associated with the loss carryforwards will be realized.  Inclusive of the tax attribute for the net operating losses, although realization is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of all of our deferred tax assets, and, accordingly, 

no

 valuation allowance has been recorded.

 

We are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income authorities.  With few exceptions for limited scope review, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for years before 2017.  In the first quarter of 2021 the Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of our refund claims for 2014 and 2015 that is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2021.  We are currently under examination by several state and local taxing jurisdictions; however, we do not expect these examinations will materially impact us.

Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies.  The portion of our life insurance and annuity risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limit is reinsured with other insurers.  We seek reinsurance coverage to limit our exposure to mortality losses and to enhance our capital management.  Reinsurance does not discharge us from our primary obligation to contract holders for losses incurred under the policies we issue.  We evaluate each reinsurance agreement to determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability.

 

As of December 31, 2020, the policy for our reinsurance program was to retain up to $

20

 million on a single insured life.  As the amount we retain varies by policy, we reinsured

% of the mortality risk on newly issued life insurance contracts in 2020.

 

We focus on obtaining reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration as well as financial strength ratings of our reinsurers.  Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers.  The amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $

16.5

 billion and $

17.1

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Protective represents our largest reinsurance exposure following the sale of the Liberty Life Business as discussed in Note 3, which resulted in amounts recoverable from Protective of $

11.3

 billion and $

11.8

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Protective has funded trusts, of which the balance in the trusts changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity, to support the business ceded, which totaled $

15.2

 billion and $

14.7

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 

Our reinsurance operations were acquired by Swiss Re in December 2001 through a series of indemnity reinsurance transactions.  As such, Swiss Re reinsured certain liabilities and obligations under the indemnity reinsurance agreements.  As we are not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from Swiss Re, which totaled $

1.2

 billion and $

1.3

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Swiss Re has funded a trust, with a balance of $

1.2

 billion as of December 31, 2020, to support this business.  In addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves.  These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and certain mortgage loans.  Our liabilities for funds withheld and embedded derivatives as of December 31, 2020, included $

151

 million and $

35

 million, respectively, related to the business sold to Swiss Re.  

 

Adoption of ASU 2016-13

 

In 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, which resulted in a new recognition and measurement of credit losses on most financial assets.  We established a credit loss allowance of $

192

 million as of January 1, 2020, for reinsurance-related assets for the risk of credit losses inherent in reinsurance transactions.  During 2020, there have not been any changes to the credit loss allowance that would be material to our financial statements.  See Note 2 for additional information.  See Note 1 for a detailed discussion regarding our accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses on our reinsurance-related assets.

 

Modco Agreements

 

Some portions of our annuity business have been reinsured on a Modco basis with other companies.  In a Modco agreement, we as the ceding company retain the reserves, as well as the assets backing those reserves, and the reinsurer shares proportionally in all financial terms of the reinsured policies based on their respective percentage of the risk.  Effective October 1, 2018, we entered into one such Modco agreement with Athene to reinsure fixed and fixed indexed annuity products, which resulted in a deposit asset of $

5.8

 billion and $

6.6

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We held assets in support of reserves associated with the transaction in a Modco investment portfolio, which consisted of the following (in millions):

The fair values of our reporting units (Level 3 fair value estimates) are comprised of the value of in-force (i.e., existing) business and the value of new business.  Specifically, new business is representative of cash flows and profitability associated with policies or contracts we expect to issue in the future, reflecting our forecasts of future sales volume and product mix over a 

10

-year period.  To determine the values of in-force and new business, we use a discounted cash flows technique that applies a discount rate reflecting the market expected, weighted-average rate of return adjusted for the risk factors associated with operations to the projected future cash flows for each reporting unit.

 

As of October 1, 2020 and 2019, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units, and, as of each such date, the fair value was in excess of each reporting unit’s carrying value for Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection.

(2)

All other incurred is primarily impacted by the level of claim resolutions in the period compared to that which is expected by the reserve assumption.  A negative number implies a favorable result where claim resolutions were more favorable than assumed.  Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the long-term life of the block of claims.  It will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably.

 

The interest rate assumption used for discounting long-term claim reserves is an important part of the reserving process due to the long benefit period for these claims.  Interest accrued on prior years’ reserves has been calculated on the opening reserve balance less one-half of the prior years’ incurred claim payments at our average reserve discount rate.

Table of Contents

 




 

Long-term disability benefits may extend for many years, and claim development schedules do not reflect these longer benefit periods.  As a result, we use longer term retrospective runoff studies, experience studies and prospective studies to develop our liability estimates.  Long-term disability reserves are discounted using rates ranging from 

2.75

% to 

5

%.  The discount rates vary by year of claim incurral.

Categorized as operating debt for leverage ratio calculations as the proceeds were primarily used as a long-term structured solution to reduce the strain on increasing statutory reserves associated with secondary guarantee UL and term policies.

Facility Agreement for Senior Notes Issuance

 

During August 2020, LNC entered into a 

10

-year facility agreement (the “facility agreement”) with a Delaware trust in connection with the sale by the trust of $

500

 million of pre-capitalized trust securities in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The trust invested the proceeds from the sale of the trust securities in a portfolio of principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities.  The facility agreement provides LNC the right to issue and sell to the trust, on one or more occasions, up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $

500

 million of LNC’s 

2.330

% senior notes due August 15, 2030 (“

2.330

% senior notes”) in exchange for a corresponding amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by the trust.  The 

2.330

% senior notes will not be issued unless and until the issuance right is exercised.  In return, LNC pays a semi-annual facility fee to the trust at a rate of 

1.691

% per year (applied to the unexercised portion of the maximum amount of senior notes that LNC could issue and sell to the trust), and LNC reimburses the trust for its expenses.

 

The issuance right will be exercised automatically in full upon our failure to make certain payments to the trust, such as paying the facility fee or reimbursing the trust for its expenses, if the failure to pay is not cured within 30 days, or upon certain bankruptcy events involving LNC.  We are also required to exercise the issuance right in full if our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding AOCI) falls below $

2.75

 billion, subject to adjustment from time to time in certain cases, and upon certain other events described in the facility agreement.

 

Prior to any involuntary exercise of the issuance right, LNC has the right to repurchase any or all of the 

2.330

% senior notes then held by the trust in exchange for U.S. Treasury securities.  LNC may redeem any outstanding 

2.330

% senior notes, in whole or in part, prior to their maturity.  Prior to May 15, 2030, the redemption price will equal the greater of par or a make-whole redemption price.  After May 15, 2030, any outstanding 

2.330

% senior notes may be redeemed at par.

Our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into irrevocable LOC facility agreements with third-party lenders supporting inter-company reinsurance agreements.

 

On July 31, 2019, we refinanced our existing credit facility with a syndicate of banks.  This facility (the “credit facility”) allows for the issuance of LOCs and borrowing of up to $

2.25

 billion.  The credit facility is unsecured and has a commitment termination date of July 31, 2024.  The LOCs under the credit facility are used primarily to satisfy reserve credit requirements of (i) our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated reinsurance companies and (ii) certain ceding companies of our legacy reinsurance business.

 

The credit agreement governing the credit facility contains or includes:

 



Customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;



Financial covenants including maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth (as defined in the credit agreement) equal to the sum of $

10.6

 billion plus 

50

% of the aggregate net proceeds of equity issuances received by us as set forth in the credit agreement; and a debt-to-capital ratio as defined in accordance with the credit facility not to exceed 

0.35

 to 

1.00

; 



A cap on secured non-operating indebtedness and non-operating indebtedness of our subsidiaries equal to 

7.5

% of total capitalization, as defined in accordance with the credit agreement; and 



Customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default.

 

Upon an event of default, the credit agreement provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable.  As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.  

 

Our LOC facility agreements each contain customary terms and conditions, including early termination fees, covenants restricting the ability of the subsidiaries to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity and dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.  Upon an event of early termination, the agreements require the immediate payment of all or a portion of the present value of the future LOC fees that would have otherwise been paid.  Further, the agreements contain customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default.  The events of default include payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies in representations and warranties, bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and other customary defaults.  Upon an event of default, the agreements provide that, among other things, obligations to issue, amend or increase the amount of any LOC shall be terminated and any obligations shall become immediately due and payable.  As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

Shelf Registration

 

We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares. 

 

Certain Debt Covenants on Capital Securities

 

Our $

1.2

 billion 

in principal amount of capital securities outstanding contain certain covenants that require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”) if we determine that one of the following trigger events exists as of the 30th day prior to an interest payment date (“determination date”):

 



LNL’s risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratio is less than 

175

% (based on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the State of Indiana); or



(i) The sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative; and (ii) our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding AOCI and any increase in stockholders’ equity resulting from the issuance of preferred stock during a quarter), or “adjusted stockholders’ equity,” as of (x) the most recently completed quarter and (y) the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed quarter, has declined by 

10

% or more as compared to the quarter that is 10 fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter, or the “benchmark quarter.” 

 

The ACSM would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy our obligation to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price.  We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events no longer existed.  Our failure to pay interest pursuant to the ACSM will not result in an event of default with respect to the capital securities nor will a nonpayment of interest unless it lasts for 

10

 consecutive years, although such breaches may result in monetary damages to the holders of the capital securities.  

As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

 

14.  Contingencies and Commitments

 

Contingencies

 

Regulatory and Litigation Matters

 

Regulatory bodies, such as state insurance departments, the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and other regulatory bodies regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws, securities laws, laws governing the activities of broker-dealers, registered investment advisers and unclaimed property laws.  

 

LNC is involved in various pending or threatened legal or regulatory proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the conduct of business both in the ordinary course and otherwise.  In some of the matters, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought.  Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief.  Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court.  In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding verdicts obtained in the jurisdiction for similar matters.  This variability in pleadings, together with the actual experiences of LNC in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. 

 

Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time is normally difficult to ascertain.  Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.  Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law.

 

We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when information related to the loss contingencies shows both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  It is possible that some matters could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be estimated as of December 31, 2020.  While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known by management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse effect on LNC’s financial condition.

Table of Contents

 




 

For some matters, the Company is able to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss.  For such matters in which a loss is probable, an accrual has been made.  For such matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, no accrual has been made.  Accordingly, the estimate contained in this paragraph reflects two types of matters.  For some matters included within this estimate, an accrual has been made, but there is a reasonable possibility that an exposure exists in excess of the amount accrued.  In these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued amount.  For other matters included within this estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss, while potentially estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable.  In these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.  As of December 31, 2020, we estimate the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, including amounts in excess of amounts accrued for these matters as of such date, to be up to approximately $

90

 

million.  Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or of the Company’s maximum possible loss exposure on such matters. 

 

For other matters, we are not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.  We are often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement negotiations.  On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and update our accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews

. 

 

Certain reinsurers have sought rate increases on certain yearly renewable term agreements.  We are disputing the requested rate increases under these agreements.  We will initiate arbitration proceedings, as necessary, under these agreements in order to protect our contractual rights.  Additionally, reinsurers have initiated, and may in the future initiate, arbitration proceedings against us.  We believe it is unlikely the outcome of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  For more information about reinsurance, see Note 9.

 

Cost of Insurance Litigation

 

Glover v. Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company

, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, No. 3:16-cv-00827, is a putative class action that was served on LNL on June 8, 2016.  Plaintiff is the owner of a universal life insurance policy who alleges that LNL charged more for non-guaranteed cost of insurance than permitted by the policy.  Plaintiff seeks to represent all universal life and variable universal life policyholders who owned policies containing non-guaranteed cost of insurance provisions that are similar to those of Plaintiff’s policy and seeks damages on behalf of all such policyholders.  On January 11, 2019, the court dismissed Plaintiff’s complaint in its entirety.  In response, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint, which we have opposed.

 

Hanks v. Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”) and Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (“Voya”)

, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:16-cv-6399, is a putative class action that was served on LLANY on August 12, 2016.  Plaintiff owns a universal life policy originally issued by Aetna (now Voya) and alleges that (i) Voya breached the terms of the policy when it increased non-guaranteed cost of insurance rates on Plaintiff’s policy; and (ii) LLANY, as reinsurer and administrator of Plaintiff’s policy, engaged in wrongful conduct related to the cost of insurance increase and was unjustly enriched as a result.  Plaintiff seeks to represent all owners of Aetna life insurance policies that were subject to non-guaranteed cost of insurance rate increases in 2016 and seeks damages on their behalf.  

On March 13, 2019, the court issued an order granting plaintiff’s motion for class certification for the breach of contract claim and denying such motion with respect to the unjust enrichment claim against LLANY, and, on September 12, 2019, the court issued an order approving the parties’ joint stipulation of dismissal with respect to the unjust enrichment claim and dismissed LLANY as a defendant in the case.  

In light of LLANY’s role as reinsurer and administrator under the 1998 coinsurance agreement with Aetna (now Voya), and of the parties’ rights and obligations thereunder, LLANY continues to be actively engaged 

in the defense of this case.  On September 30, 2020, the court denied plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and granted in part Voya’s motion for summary judgment.  The court has not yet set a trial date, and we continue to vigorously defend this action.

 

EFG Bank AG, Cayman Branch, et al. v. The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company

, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 2:17-cv-02592, is a civil action filed on February 1, 2017.  Plaintiffs own Legend Series universal life insurance policies originally issued by Jefferson-Pilot (now LNL).  Plaintiffs allege that LNL breached the terms of policyholders’ contracts when it increased 

non-guaranteed 

cost of insurance rates beginning in 2016.  We are vigorously defending this matter.

 

In re: Lincoln National COI Litigation

, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Master File No. 2:16-cv-06605-GJP, is a consolidated litigation matter related to multiple putative class action filings that were consolidated by an order dated March 20, 2017.  In addition to consolidating a number of existing matters, the order also covers any future cases filed in the same district related to the same subject matter.  Plaintiffs own universal life insurance policies originally issued by Jefferson-Pilot (now LNL).  Plaintiffs allege that LNL and LNC breached the terms of policyholders’ contracts by increasing non-guaranteed cost of insurance rates beginning in 2016.  Plaintiffs seek to represent classes of policyowners and seek damages on their behalf.  We are vigorously defending this matter.

Iwanski v. First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Company

 (“FPP”), No. 2:18-cv-01573 filed in the U.S. District Court for the District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania is a putative class action that was filed on April 13, 2018.  Plaintiff alleges that defendant FPP breached the terms of his life insurance policy by deducting non-guaranteed cost of insurance charges in excess of what is permitted by the policies.  Plaintiff seeks to represent all owners of universal life insurance policies issued by FPP containing non-guaranteed cost of insurance provisions that are similar to those of Plaintiff’s policy and seeks damages on their behalf.  Breach of contract is the only cause of action asserted.  We are vigorously defending this matter.

Plaintiff alleges that LLANY charged more for non-guaranteed cost of insurance than was permitted by the policies.  Plaintiff seeks to represent all current and former owners of universal life (including variable universal life) policies who own or owned policies issued by LLANY and its predecessors in interest that were in force at any time on or after June 27, 2013, and which contain non-guaranteed cost of insurance provisions that are similar to those of Plaintiff’s policies.  Plaintiff also seeks to represent a sub-class of such policyholders who own or owned “life insurance policies issued in the State of New York.”  Plaintiff seeks damages on behalf of the policyholder class and sub-class.  We are vigorously defending this matter.

 

Other Litigation 

 

Andrew Nitkewicz v. Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York,

 pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:20-cv-06805, is a putative class action that was filed on August 24, 2020.  Plaintiff Andrew Nitkewicz, as trustee of the Joan C. Lupe Trust, seeks to represent all current and former owners of universal life (including variable universal life) policies who own or owned policies issued by LLANY and its predecessors in interest that were in force at any time on or after June 27, 2013, and for which planned annual, semi-annual, or quarterly premiums were paid for any period beyond the end of the policy month of the insured’s death.  Plaintiff alleges LLANY failed to refund unearned premium in violation of New York Insurance Law Section 3203(a)(2) in connection with the payment of death benefit claims for certain insurance policies.  Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages and pre-judgment interest on behalf of the various classes and sub-class.  We are vigorously defending this matter.

Vulnerability from Concentrations 

 

As of December 31, 2020, we did not have a concentration of:  business transactions with a particular customer or lender; sources of supply of labor or services used in the business; or a market or geographic area in which business is conducted that makes us vulnerable to an event that is at least reasonably possible to occur in the near term and which could cause a severe impact to our financial condition.  For information on our investment and reinsurance concentrations, see Notes 5 and 9, respectively.    

 

Other Contingency Matters 

 

State guaranty funds assess insurance companies to cover losses to contract holders of insolvent or rehabilitated companies.  Mandatory assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states.  We have accrued for expected assessments and the related reductions in future state premium taxes, which net to assessments (recoveries) of $(

9

) million and $(

12

) million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

In the event the average market price of LNC common stock exceeds the issue price of stock options and the options have a dilutive effect to our EPS, such options will be shown in the table above.

 

We have participants in our deferred compensation plans who selected LNC stock as the measure for the investment return attributable to all or a portion of their deferral amounts.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, the effect of settling this obligation in LNC stock (“equity classification”) was more dilutive than the scenario of settling in cash (“liability classification”).  Therefore, for our EPS calculation for this period, we added these shares to the denominator and adjusted the numerator to present net income as if the shares had been accounted for under equity classification by removing the mark-to-market adjustment included in net income attributable to these deferred units of LNC stock.  The amount of this adjustment was $

18

 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 

The outstanding warrants issued in 2009, each representing the right to purchase 

one

 share of our common stock, expired on July 10, 2019.

18.  Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans

 

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

 

We maintain U.S. defined benefit pension plans in which certain U.S. employees and agents are participants, and a U.K. plan we retained after the sale of the Lincoln UK business.  Our defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants and existing participants do not accrue any additional benefits.  We comply with the minimum funding requirements in both the U.S. and the U.K.  In accordance with such practice, we were not required to make contributions but elected to contribute $

2

 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  We do not expect to be required to make any contributions to these pension plans in 2021.  We sponsor other postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance to certain retired employees and agents.  Total net periodic cost (recovery) for these plans was $(

11

) million, $

8

 million and $(

2

) million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  In 2021, we expect the plans to make benefit payments of approximately $

110

 million.

The increase in the fair value of plan assets during the reporting period was driven by market performance.  The weighted average discount rate was determined based on a corporate yield curve as of December 31, 2020, and projected benefit obligation cash flows.  The expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various asset categories, using the plans’ target plan allocation.  We reevaluate these assumptions each plan year.

Defined Contribution Plans

 

We sponsor tax-qualified defined contribution plans for eligible employees and agents.  We administer these plans in accordance with the plan documents and various limitations under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, expenses for these plans were $

100

 million, $

104

 million and $

93

 million, respectively.  

 

Deferred Compensation Plans

 

We sponsor non-qualified, unfunded, deferred compensation plans for certain current and former employees, agents and non-employee directors.  The results of certain notional investment options within some of the plans are hedged by total return swaps.  Our expenses increase or decrease in direct proportion to the change in market value of the participants’ investment options.  Participants of certain plans are able to select our stock as a notional investment option; however, it is not hedged by the total return swaps and is a primary source of expense volatility related to these plans.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, expenses for these plans were $

35

 million, $

28

 million and $

 million, respectively.  For further discussion of total return swaps related to our deferred compensation plans, see Note 6.

Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans

 

We sponsor stock-based incentive compensation plans for our employees and directors and for the employees and agents of our subsidiaries that provide for the issuance of stock options, performance shares, and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), among other types of awards.  We issue new shares to satisfy option exercises and vested performance shares and RSUs.

20.  Statutory Information and Restrictions 

 

The Company’s domestic life insurance subsidiaries prepare financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of their states of domicile, which may vary materially from GAAP.

 

Prescribed SAP includes the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and administrative rules.  Permitted SAP encompasses all accounting practices not so prescribed.  The principal differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are that statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, contract holder liabilities are generally valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are non-admitted.

 

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the applicable laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile.  Changes in these laws and regulations could change capital levels or capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries.

Comparison of 2020 to 2019

 

Statutory net income (loss) decreased due primarily to increases in benefits and unfavorable reserve strain on certain products, partially offset by favorable equity markets.  

 

Comparison of 2019 to 2018

 

Statutory net income (loss) decreased due primarily to lower dividends from affiliates, unfavorable reserve strain on certain products, and integration costs incurred as part of the acquisition of Liberty Life.  See Note 3 for information regarding the acquisition.

 

State Prescribed and Permitted Practices

 

The states of domicile of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries have adopted certain prescribed or permitted accounting practices that differ from those found in NAIC SAP.  These prescribed practices are the calculation of reserves on universal life policies based on the Indiana universal life method as prescribed by the state of Indiana for policies issued before January 1, 2006, the use of a more conservative valuation interest rate on certain annuities prescribed by the states of Indiana and New York and use of the continuous Commissioners’ Annuity Reserve Valuation Method in the calculation of reserves as prescribed by the state of New York.  The statutory permitted practice allows accounting for certain call option derivative assets at amortized cost and allows determining certain indexed annuity and indexed life statutory reserve calculations with the assumption that the market value of the related liability call option(s) associated with the current index term is zero.  At the conclusion of the index term, credited interest is reflected in the reserve as realized, based on actual index performance.

 

The Vermont reinsurance subsidiaries also have certain accounting practices permitted by the state of Vermont that differ from those found in NAIC SAP.  One permitted practice involves accounting for the lesser of the face amount of all amounts outstanding under an LOC and the value of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) additional statutory reserves as an admitted asset and a form of surplus as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Another permitted practice involves the acquisition of an LLC note in exchange for a variable value surplus note that is recognized as an admitted asset and a form of surplus as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Lastly, the state of Vermont has permitted a practice to account for certain excess of loss reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers as an asset and form of surplus as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  These permitted practices are related to structures that continue to be allowed in accordance with the grandfathered structures under the provisions of Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG48”) or are compliant under AG48 requirements.

These permitted practices are related to structures that continue to be allowed in accordance with the grandfathered structures under the provisions of AG48 or are compliant under AG48 requirements. 

 

The NAIC has adopted RBC requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks.  The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile.  Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to its company action level of RBC (known as the “RBC ratio”), also as defined by the NAIC.  The company action level may be triggered if the RBC ratio is between 

75

% and 

100

%, which would require the insurer to submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake.  As of December 31, 2020, the consolidated RBC ratio for LNC’s statutory insurance companies was in excess of four times the aforementioned company action level RBC.

 

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company.  Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), only from unassigned surplus and must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation.  The current statutory limitation is the greater of 

10

% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus.  Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits.  LNL’s subsidiaries, LLANY, a New York-domiciled insurance company, and LLACB, a New Hampshire-domiciled company, are bound by similar restrictions, under the laws of New York and New Hampshire, respectively.  Under both New York and New Hampshire law, the applicable statutory limitation on dividends is equal to the lesser of 

10

% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.  We expect our direct domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends to LNC of approximately $

865

 million in 2021 without prior approval from the respective Commissioner of Insurance.

 

All payments of principal and interest on surplus notes between LNC and our insurance subsidiaries must be approved by the respective Commissioner of Insurance.

Valuation Methodologies and Associated Inputs for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

 

The following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments not carried at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Considerable judgment is required to develop these assumptions used to measure fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates shown are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-time, current market exchange of all of our financial instruments. 

 

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate

 

The fair value of mortgage loans on real estate, excluding mortgage loans accounted for using the fair value option, is established using a discounted cash flow method based on credit rating, maturity and future income.  The ratings for mortgages in good standing are based on property type, location, market conditions, occupancy, debt-service coverage, loan-to-value, quality of tenancy, borrower and payment record.  The fair value for impaired mortgage loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our mortgage loans on real estate are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Other Investments

 

The carrying value of our assets classified as other investments approximates fair value.  Other investments includes primarily LPs and other privately held investments that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and the carrying value is based on our proportional share of the net assets of the LPs.  Other investments also includes Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock carried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our LPs, other privately held investments and FHLB stock are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  The remaining assets in other investments include cash collateral receivables and securities that are not LPs or other privately held investments. The inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.

 

Separate Account Assets

 

Separate account assets are primarily carried at fair value.  A portion of our separate account assets includes LPs, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  The carrying value is based on our proportional share of the net assets of the LPs and approximates fair value. The inputs used to measure the fair value of the separate account asset LPs are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 

 

Other Contract Holder Funds

 

Other contract holder funds include remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts and account values of certain investment contracts.  The fair value for the remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts is estimated using discounted cash flow calculations as of the balance sheet date.  These calculations are based on interest rates currently offered on similar contracts with maturities that are consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the remaining guaranteed interest and similar contracts carrying value approximated fair value.  The fair value of the account values of certain investment contracts is based on their approximate surrender value as of the balance sheet date.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our other contract holder funds are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

 

Short-Term and Long-Term Debt

 

 

The fair value of short-term and long-term debt is based on quoted market prices.  The inputs used to measure the fair value of our short-term and long-term debt are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.   

 

Fair Value Option

 

Mortgage loans on real estate, net of allowance for credit losses, as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, includes commercial mortgage loans for which the fair value option was elected.  The fair value option allows us to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for mortgage loans not otherwise reported at fair value.  We have made these elections for certain mortgage loans associated with Modco agreements to help mitigate the inconsistency in earnings that would otherwise result from the use of embedded derivatives included with these loans.  Changes in fair value are reflected in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for commercial mortgage loans.  Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated using changes in credit spreads and quality ratings for the period reported.  Due to lack of observable inputs as a result of a change to a third-party pricing source, certain mortgage loans electing the fair value option were categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2020.

 

 

The fair value and aggregate contractual principal for mortgage loans where the fair value option was elected (in millions) was as follows:

Transfers into and out of Level 3 are generally the result of observable market information on a security no longer being available or becoming available to our pricing vendors.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, transfers in and out of Level 3 were attributable primarily to the securities’ observable market information no longer being available or becoming available.  In 2020, transfers into Level 3 included certain commercial mortgage loans electing the fair value option.  The transfers were due to a lack of observable valuation inputs used by a third-party pricing source.  In 2018, transfers into or out of Level 3 also included FHLB stock between equity securities and other investments at cost on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(1)

Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments, unless otherwise noted.

(2)

The liquidity/duration adjustment input represents an estimated market participant composite of adjustments attributable to liquidity premiums, expected durations, structures and credit quality that would be applied to the market observable information of an investment.

(3)

The lapse rate input represents the estimated probability of a contract surrendering during a year, and thereby forgoing any future benefits.  The range for indexed annuity and IUL contracts represents the lapse rates during the surrender charge period.

(4)

The utilization of guaranteed withdrawals input represents the estimated percentage of contract holders that utilize the guaranteed withdrawal feature.

(5)

The utilization factors are applied to the present value of claims or premiums, as appropriate, in the GLB reserve calculation to estimate the impact of inefficient withdrawal behavior, including taking less than or more than the maximum guaranteed withdrawal.

(6)

The NPR input represents the estimated additional credit spread that market participants would apply to the market observable discount rate when pricing a contract. The NPR input was weighted by the absolute value of the sensitivity of the reserve to the NPR assumption.

(7)

The mortality rate input represents the estimated probability of when an individual belonging to a particular group, categorized according to age or some other factor such as gender, will die.

(8)

The volatility input represents overall volatilities assumed for the underlying variable annuity funds, which include a mixture of equity and fixed-income assets.  Fair value of the variable annuity GLB embedded derivatives would increase if higher volatilities were used for valuation.  Volatility assumptions vary by fund due to the benchmarking of different indices.  The volatility input was weighted by the relative account value assigned to each index.

(9)

The mortality rate is based on a combination of company and industry experience, adjusted for improvement factors.

(10)

A weighted average input range is not a meaningful measurement for lapse rate, utilization factors or mortality rate.

Table of Contents

 




 

From the table above, we have excluded Level 3 fair value measurements obtained from independent, third-party pricing sources.  We do not develop the significant inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and the information regarding the significant inputs is not readily available to us.  Independent broker-quoted fair values are non-binding quotes developed by market makers or broker-dealers obtained from third-party sources recognized as market participants.  The fair value of a broker-quoted asset or liability is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant as we do not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset or liability.  Significant increases or decreases in any of the quotes received from a third-party broker-dealer may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.  

 

Changes in any of the significant inputs presented in the table above would have resulted in a significant change in the fair value measurement of the asset or liability as follows:

 



Investments

 – An increase in the liquidity/duration adjustment input would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement.



Indexed annuity and IUL contracts embedded derivatives

 – For direct embedded derivatives, an increase in the lapse rate or mortality rate inputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement.  



GLB embedded derivatives 

– Assuming our GLB direct embedded derivatives are in a liability position:  an increase in our lapse rate, NPR or mortality rate inputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement; and an increase in the utilization of guaranteed withdrawal or volatility inputs would have resulted in an increase in the fair value measurement.

 

For each category discussed above, the unobservable inputs are not inter-related; therefore, a directional change in one input would not have affected the other inputs.  

 

As part of our ongoing valuation process, we assess the reasonableness of our valuation techniques or models and make adjustments as necessary.  For more information, see Note 1.

 

22.  Segment Information 

 

We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments.  As discussed in Note 3, we completed the acquisition of Liberty Life during the second quarter of 2018.  Related results are included within the Group Protection segment.  We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  Our reporting segments reflect the manner by which our chief operating decision makers view and manage the business.  The following is a brief description of these segments and Other Operations

.

 

The Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed (including indexed) and variable annuities.

 

The Retirement Plan Services segment provides employer-sponsored defined benefit and individual retirement accounts, as well as individual and group variable annuities, group fixed annuities and mutual-fund based programs in the retirement plan marketplace. 

 

The Life Insurance segment focuses in the creation and protection of wealth through life insurance products, including term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs), IUL and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned UL and VUL and bank-owned UL and VUL products.

 

The Group Protection segment offers group non-medical insurance products, including short and long-term disability, absence management services, term life, dental, vision and accident and critical illness benefits and services to the employer marketplace through various forms of employee-paid and employer-paid plans.

 

Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; benefit plan net liability; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance;

 the results of certain disability income business; our run-off institutional

 pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis; debt costs; strategic digitization expense; and other corporate investments.

 

Segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are internal measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate and assess the results of our segments.  Income (loss) from operations is GAAP net income excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:

  



Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized gain (loss)”): 



Sales or disposals and impairments of financial assets;



Changes in the fair value of equity securities;



Changes in the fair value of derivatives, embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and trading securities (“gain (loss) on the mark-to-market on certain instruments”);



Changes in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our GDB riders within our variable annuities;



Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our GLB riders reflected within variable annuity net derivative results accounted for at fair value;



Changes in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our GLB riders reflected within variable annuity net derivative results; and



Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index options we may purchase or sell in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for at fair value (“indexed annuity forward-starting option”); 



Changes in reserves resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (“benefit ratio unlocking”);



Income (loss) from reserve changes, net of related amortization, on business sold through reinsurance;



Gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt;



Losses from the impairment of intangible assets;



Income (loss) from discontinued operations;



Acquisition and integration costs related to mergers and acquisitions; and



Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards, regulations, and policy changes including the net impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

 

Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:

 



Excluded realized gain (loss);



Revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards;



Amortization of DFEL arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking; and



Amortization of deferred gains arising from reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance.

 

The tables below reconcile our segment measures of performance to the GAAP measures presented in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) (in millions):

Item 9A.

  Con

trols and Procedures 

 

(a)

Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.  

 

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included on page 

106

 of “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and is incorporated herein by reference. 

 

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.  Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  Projections of any evaluation of controls’ effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

 

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Performance shares, restricted stock units, and deferred stock units are not included in determining the weighted average in column (b) because they have no exercise price.
