Executive Overview

Business Description

Our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select U.S. markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the market allocation of our investments by current market value and share of total revenue and NOI, as well as relative asset value and submarket positioning.

We develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, Northern and Southern California, as well as in our expansion markets in Southeast Florida and Denver, Colorado (the "Expansion Markets"). We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe historically have been characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics have offered and will continue in the future to offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns over the long-term on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; leveraging our scale and competencies in technology and data science to operate apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. 

2020 Financial Highlights

Net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $827,630,000, an increase of $41,656,000, or 5.3%, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains, as well as NOI from Development and Other Stabilized Communities in the current year. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in NOI from Established Communities and communities sold in 2019 and 2020, and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year.

Established Communities NOI for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $96,395,000, or 6.4%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to a decrease in rental revenue of 3.7%, of which $43,970,000 was due to uncollectible lease revenue, $33,768,000 of which was for residential revenue and $10,202,000 was for commercial revenue, as well as an increase in property operating expenses of $17,424,000, or 2.9%, over 2019.

During 2020, we raised approximately $2,150,622,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes and the sale of nine consolidated operating communities, condominiums at The Park Loggia and other real estate. This amount does not include our share of proceeds from joint venture dispositions.  We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.

We believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2020, we:

•

Completed the construction of eight consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 2,095 apartment homes for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $777,000,000. 

•

Started the construction of three consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 591 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $221,000,000.

•

Started the construction of one unconsolidated apartment community containing 475 apartment homes, which is expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $276,000,000, or $69,000,000 when including only our 25.0% interest.

We believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing), provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

COVID-19 Pandemic

We have taken various actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to adjust our business operations and to address the health and safety of our residents and associates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adopted varying measures to help mitigate the financial impact arising from the national emergency on our residents, including providing flexible lease renewal options, creating payment plans for residents who are unable to pay their rent because they are impacted by this national emergency and, in certain jurisdictions, waiving late fees and certain other customary fees associated with apartment rentals. To the extent still implemented, we may discontinue these measures at any time except where required by law.

The impact on our consolidated results of operations from COVID-19 for periods beyond 2020 will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccines and the timing of vaccine availability, the duration and nature of governmental responses to contain the spread of the disease and cushion the impact on consumers, the responses of consumers and businesses with respect to living and work preferences, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The current and potential future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, particularly on (i) rent levels, collectibility of rents, occupancy and the extent to which we waive certain other customary fees associated with our apartment rental business and (ii) development timing and volume, mean that our historical results of operations and financial condition are not indicative of future results of operations and financial condition. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our rental operations including (i) revenues and expenses, as well as (ii) our collections and associated outstanding receivables. For further discussion see "Results of Operations." The following table presents the percentage of (i) apartment base rent charged to residents and (ii) other rentable items, including parking and storage rent, along with pet and other fees in accordance with residential leases, that has been collected ("Collected Residential Revenue") for Established Communities for the three months ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Collected Residential Revenue excludes transactional and other fees.

The collection rates are based on individual resident activity as reflected in our property management systems and are presented to provide information about collections trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the collections information provided was not routinely produced for internal use by senior management or publicly disclosed by the Company and is a result of analysis that is not subject to internal controls over financial reporting. This information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, does not reflect GAAP revenue or cash flow metrics and may be subject to adjustment in preparing GAAP revenue and cash flow metrics. Additionally, this information should not be interpreted as predicting the Company’s financial performance, results of operations or liquidity for any period. At December 31, 2020, our outstanding rent receivable balance for residential and commercial tenants, net of reserves, increased to $18,159,000 from $11,594,000 at December 31, 2019. 

Communities Overview

As of December 31, 2020 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 291 apartment communities containing 86,025 apartment homes in 11 states and the District of Columbia, of which 16 consolidated communities were under development and one community was under redevelopment. We have an indirect interest in 14 of the 291 apartment communities which were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including two that are being developed within joint ventures. In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 24 communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 7,853 apartment homes.

Our real estate investments consist primarily of Current Communities, Development Communities, Unconsolidated Development Communities and Development Rights. Our Current Communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities, Redevelopment Communities and Unconsolidated Communities.

Established Communities are generally consolidated communities in markets where we have a significant presence that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy at the beginning of the current year or were acquired during the year. Lease-Up Communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the fiscal year. Unconsolidated Communities are communities in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated entity. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, “Segment Reporting,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in “Results of Operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.

Results of Operations

As discussed above under “Executive Overview - COVID-19 Pandemic” and elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our business, and may continue to do so. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions, development completions and development under construction and in lease-up; loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for 2020 and 2019 follows (dollars in thousands). Discussion of our operating results for 2019 and comparison to 2018 can be found in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2020.

Net income attributable to common stockholders

 increased $41,656,000, or 5.3%, to $827,630,000 in 2020 from 2019, primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains, as well as NOI from Development and Other Stabilized Communities in the current year. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in NOI from Established Communities and communities sold in 2019 and 2020, and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year.

NOI

 is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities, depreciation expense, corporate income tax (benefit) expense, casualty and impairment (gain) loss, net, gain on sale of communities, (gain) loss on other real estate transactions, net for-sale condominium activity and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale.

NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):

The decrease in our Established Communities' NOI in 2020 is due to a decrease in rental revenue of 3.7%, of which $43,970,000 was due to uncollectible lease revenue, $33,768,000 of which was for residential revenue and $10,202,000 was for commercial revenue, as well as an increase in property operating expenses of $17,424,000, or 2.9%, over 2019.

Rental and other income

 for the consolidated portfolio decreased $22,224,000, or 1.0%, in 2020 compared to the prior year due to an increase of $53,298,000 in uncollectible lease revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, of which $39,600,000 relates to residential revenue and $13,698,000 relates to commercial revenue, as well as decreased occupancy and rental rates at our Established Communities and revenue from communities sold in 2019 and 2020, partially offset by additional rental income generated from development completions, development under construction and in lease-up and acquired operating communities. 

During 2020 as a result of the pandemic, we increased our use of residential concessions. The increased concessions, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective leases (generally one year), contributed to the overall decline in our rental revenue in 2020 and will continue to impact rental revenue in 2021. The amortization of residential concessions increased by $21,434,000 in 2020 as compared to the prior year, and the remaining net unamortized balance of residential concessions as of December 31, 2020 was $35,367,000.

As discussed elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 impact and related economic, regulatory and operating impacts are likely to continue to adversely affect our rental revenue, and comparisons to prior year periods, during the COVID-19 pandemic. If job losses in our markets and nationally continue, this would likely continue to decrease our ability to maintain and/or increase rents and/or maintain occupancy at our historical levels. Deteriorating financial conditions among our residents and commercial tenants, as well as regulations that limit our ability to evict residents and tenants, may continue to result in higher than normal uncollectible lease revenue. 

The pandemic may also continue to depress demand among consumers for our apartments for a variety of other reasons, including the following: consumers whose income has declined, who are working from home remotely or who cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues, may decide during the pandemic to live in markets or submarkets that are less costly than ours; low interest rates that are caused by government response to the pandemic may encourage consumers who would otherwise rent to seek out home ownership; and various sources of demand for our apartments (e.g., students, corporate apartment homes, seasonal job-related demand as in the entertainment industry) may remain below pre-pandemic levels.

Consolidated Communities—The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 73,724 apartment homes for 2020, as compared to 72,901 homes for 2019. The weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $2,593 for 2020 as compared to $2,647 in 2019.

(1)      Includes both residential and commercial rental revenue. Total Established Communities residential rental revenue decreased 3.2% in 2020 from 2019.

(2)   Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents.

Management, development and other fees

 decreased $1,141,000, or 23.0%, in 2020 as a result of dispositions by unconsolidated ventures resulting in lower property and asset management fees earned in the current year, coupled with lower revenue within the ventures.

Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes

 increased $21,544,000, or 5.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. The increase is also partially due to operating expenses at our Established Communities, including increased turnover expenses and an increase in COVID-19 related costs for personal protective equipment and cleaning.

For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $9,034,000, or 2.4%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to overall operating costs, including increased turnover expenses and an increase in COVID-19 related costs for personal protective equipment and cleaning.

Property taxes

 increased $20,228,000, or 8.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities and increased assessments for the Company's stabilized portfolio, partially offset by decreased property taxes from dispositions.

For Established Communities, property taxes increased $8,390,000, or 3.7%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased assessments and rates across the portfolio in the current year, as well as successful appeals in the prior year in excess of those in the current year. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate.

Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses

 increased $13,224,000, or 15.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to costs related to an increased investment in technology initiatives to improve efficiency in services for residents and prospects, increased compensation related costs and advocacy contributions of $8,558,000 related to California Proposition 21 in the current year. Proposition 21 was a California referendum that failed in the November 3, 2020 election.

Expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries

 primarily reflect costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and therefore may vary significantly from year to year. Expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, increased $7,408,000, or 148.4%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The amount for 2020 includes the write-off of $7,264,000 related to a Development Right in New York City, with a projected total capitalized cost of $688,000,000, that we no longer expect is probable. 

Interest expense, net

 increased $10,566,000, or 5.2%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, and interest income. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest and interest income, coupled with an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness in the current year. This was partially offset by lower overall effective rates on unsecured indebtedness, a combination of a decrease in variable rates on, and amounts of, secured indebtedness, and gain on interest rate contract.

Loss on the extinguishment of debt, net

 reflects

 

prepayment penalties, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired. The loss of $9,333,000 in 2020 was primarily due to the repayments of unsecured notes during the year, ahead of their scheduled maturity.

Depreciation expense

 increased $45,753,000, or 6.9%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, partially offset by dispositions.

General and administrative expense

 (“G&A”) increased $2,301,000, or 4.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to legal settlement proceeds that were present in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in compensation related expenses due to associate retirements in 2019.

Equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities

 decreased $2,230,000, or 25.8%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreased NOI from the ventures in the current year, including dispositions and our acquisition of the 45.0% equity interest of AVA North Point that was owned by our venture partner in 2019, upon which we consolidated AVA North Point as a wholly-owned operating community. 

Gain on sale of communities

 increased in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. The gain of $340,444,000 in 2020 was primarily due to the sale of nine wholly-owned operating communities. The gain of $166,105,000 in 2019 was primarily due to the sale of six wholly-owned operating communities. 

Net for-sale condominium activity

 is a net gain of $2,551,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and an expense of $3,812,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in 2020 is comprised of the gain before taxes on the sale of condominiums at The Park Loggia, net of marketing, operating and administrative costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 70 residential condominiums at The Park Loggia, for gross proceeds of $216,372,000, resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $8,213,000. In addition, we incurred $5,662,000 and $3,812,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in marketing, operating and administrative costs.

Income tax benefit (expense) 

of $3,247,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to losses generated through taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") and provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, allowing for further carryback of net operating losses. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of $5,782,000 of income tax expenses for a deferred tax liability for the GAAP to tax basis differences at The Park Loggia, which is being realized as we sell the condominiums, and $7,221,000 related to other activity we undertook through TRSs including the disposition of two wholly-owned operating communities and expense for deferred tax liabilities related to our sustainability initiatives.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders, or “FFO,” and FFO adjusted for non-core items, or “Core FFO,” as defined below, are generally considered by management to be appropriate supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. By further adjusting for items that are not considered by us to be part of our core business operations, Core FFO allows one to compare the core operating performance of the Company year over year. We believe that, in order to understand our operating results, FFO and Core FFO should be examined with net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this report.

Consistent with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts® (“NAREIT”), we calculate FFO as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for:

•

gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities;

•

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle;

•

impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets;

•

write-downs of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates;

•

depreciation of real estate assets; and

•

similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including those from a change in control.

We calculate Core FFO as FFO, adjusted for:

•

joint venture gains (if not adjusted through FFO), non-core costs and promoted interests from partnerships;

•

casualty and impairment losses or gains, net on non-depreciable real estate;

•

gains or losses from early extinguishment of consolidated borrowings;

•

abandoned pursuits;

•

business interruption insurance proceeds and the related lost NOI that is covered by the expected business interruption insurance proceeds;

•

property and casualty insurance proceeds and legal settlements;

•

gains or losses on sales of assets not subject to depreciation;

•

advocacy contributions, representing payments to promote our business interests;

•

hedge ineffectiveness or gains or losses from derivatives not designated as hedges for accounting purposes;

•

severance related costs; 

•

net for-sale condominium activity, including gains, marketing, operating and administrative costs and imputed carry cost;

•

income taxes; and 

•

other non-core items.

FFO and Core FFO do not represent net income in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income, which remains the primary measure, as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO and Core FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and Core FFO.

FFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A presentation of GAAP based cash flow metrics is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

The following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders and to Core FFO attributable to common stockholders (dollars in thousands, except per share data).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal focus on near-term and intermediate-term liquidity is to ensure we have adequate capital to fund:

•

development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged or in which we plan to engage;

•

the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code;

•

debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity;

•

normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses; and

•

investment in our operating platform, including strategic investments.

Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Cash flows from operations are determined by: operating activities and factors including but not limited to (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels (iv) uncollectible lease revenue levels or interruptions in collections caused by market conditions and (v) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage is affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. Our plans for development, redevelopment, non-routine capital expenditure, acquisition and disposition activity are affected by market conditions and capital availability. We frequently review our liquidity needs, especially in periods with volatile market conditions, as well as the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.

We had cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow of $313,532,000 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $185,918,000 from $127,614,000 at December 31, 2019. The following discussion relates to changes in cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.

Operating Activities—Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $1,219,615,000 in 2020 from $1,321,804,000 in 2019, primarily due to decreases in rental income, including the impact of uncollectible lease revenue.

Investing Activities—Net cash used in investing activities totaled $179,433,000 in 2020. The net cash used was primarily due to:

•

investment of $843,907,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; and

•

capital expenditures of $137,036,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets (primarily related to our corporate and certain regional offices).

These amounts are partially offset by:

•

net proceeds from the disposition of nine operating communities of $619,773,000; and

•

net proceeds from the sale of for-sale residential condominiums of $202,033,000.

Financing Activities—Net cash used in financing activities totaled $854,264,000 in 2020. The net cash used was primarily due to:

•

repayments of unsecured notes in the amount of $958,680,000;

•

payment of cash dividends in the amount of $883,212,000; 

•

the repurchase of 1,225,790 shares of our common stock at an average price of $149.99 per share for a total purchase price including fees of $183,876,000; and

•

the repayment of mortgage notes payable in the amount of $126,712,000, of which $56,852,000 was subsequently refinanced, as discussed below.

These amounts are partially offset by:

•

proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of $1,296,581,000; and

•

the issuance of a secured note that was part of a refinancing, as discussed above, in the amount of $51,000,000.

Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility

We have a $1,750,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Facility”) which matures in February 2024. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) applicable to the period of borrowing for a particular draw of funds from the facility (e.g., one month to maturity, three months to maturity, etc.) and (ii) the rating levels issued for our unsecured notes. The current stated pricing for drawn borrowings is LIBOR plus 0.775% per annum (0.89% at January 31, 2021), assuming a one month borrowing rate. The annual facility fee for the Credit Facility remained at 0.125%, resulting in a fee of $2,188,000 annually based on the $1,750,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating.

We had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $2,900,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2021. In addition, we had $32,943,000 outstanding in additional letters of credit on a separate facility unrelated to the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2021.

The phase-out of LIBOR and expected transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects on our LIBOR borrowings. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.

Financial Covenants

We are subject to financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility, Term Loans and the indentures under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:

•

limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure;

•

limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and

•

minimum levels of debt service coverage.

We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2020.

In addition, some of our secured borrowings include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.

Continuous Equity Offering Program 

In May 2019, we commenced our fifth continuous equity program ("CEP V") under which we may sell (and/or enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of) up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP V, we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. We expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, a commission of up to 1.5% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. During 2020 and through January 31, 2021, we had no sales under the program. As of January 31, 2021, there are no outstanding forward sale agreements and we had $752,878,000 remaining authorized for issuance under this program.

Forward Interest Rate Swap Agreements

The following activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020:

•

We settled an aggregate of $600,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements, making aggregate payments of $25,135,000. Of the positions settled by us, $250,000,000 were forward interest swaps that we had entered into during 2020. The settled positions were comprised of the following:

42 

Table of 

Contents

◦

In conjunction with the issuance of our $700,000,000 unsecured notes due 2030 in February 2020, we settled $350,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes, making a payment of $20,314,000. 

◦

In conjunction with the issuance of our $600,000,000 unsecured notes due 2031 in May 2020, we settled $250,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes, making a payment of $4,821,000. 

We have deferred these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognizing the impact as a component of interest expense, net, over the term of the respective hedged debt. 

•

We entered into an additional $150,000,000 of new forward interest rate swap agreements that were executed to reduce the impact of variability of interest rates on a portion of expected debt issuance activity in 2021 (the "Swaps"). Based on changes in our expected capital needs in 2021 as of December 31, 2020, while we may still issue debt in 2021, it is no longer probable that we will issue the debt for which the Swaps were executed. As a result, we ceased hedge accounting and recognized a gain of $2,894,000 for the change in fair of the Swaps for the three months ended December 31, 2020. In January 2021, we terminated the Swaps and received a payment of $6,962,000.

Stock Repurchase Program

In July 2020, our Board of Directors voted to terminate our prior $500,000,000 Stock Repurchase Program (the "Amended 2005 Stock Repurchase Program") and approved a new stock repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of $500,000,000 (the "2020 Stock Repurchase Program"). Purchases of common stock under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be exercised from time to time in our discretion and in such amounts as market conditions warrant. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of January 31, 2021, we repurchased 1,225,790 shares of common stock at an average price of $149.99 per share, of which all activity took place during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2021, we had $316,148,000 remaining authorized for purchase under this program.

Future Financing and Capital Needs—Debt Maturities

One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity.  For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that capital from additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory, especially in light of the uncertain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital markets.

The following debt activity occurred during 2020:

•

In February 2020, we issued $700,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $694,701,000. The notes mature in March 2030 and were issued at a 2.30% interest rate. 

•

In February 2020, we refinanced the secured borrowing for Avalon San Bruno III. The secured borrowing had a fixed interest rate of 3.08% and was refinanced for a principal balance of $51,000,000, with a fixed interest rate of 2.38% and maturity date of March 2027.

•

In March 2020, we repaid (i) $400,000,000 principal amount of our 3.625% unsecured notes in advance of the October 2020 scheduled maturity and (ii) $250,000,000 principal amount of our 3.95% unsecured notes in advance of the January 2021 scheduled maturity. In conjunction with these repayments, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $9,170,000 for prepayment penalties and the non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

•

In May 2020, we issued $600,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $593,430,000. The notes mature in January 2031 and were issued at a 2.45% interest rate.

•

In May 2020, we repaid $300,000,000 principal amount of variable rate unsecured notes in advance of the January 2021 scheduled maturity, recognizing a charge of $268,000 for the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs.

•

In August 2020, we repaid $67,904,000 principal amount of 4.18% fixed rate debt secured by Avalon Hoboken at par in advance of the December 2020 maturity date. 

In January 2021, we repaid $27,795,000 principal amount of 5.37% fixed rate debt secured by Avalon San Bruno II at par in advance of the April 2021 maturity date.

The following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands). We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest.

Future Financing and Capital Needs—Portfolio and Capital Markets Activity

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to monitor the availability of our various capital raising alternatives. In 2021, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from one or more a variety of internal and external sources, which may include (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. Additional sources of liquidity in 2021 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. In addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital markets, including the availability and costs of debt and equity capital, remain uncertain and may have material adverse effects on our access to capital on attractive terms. 

Before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity in 2021, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we plan to source sufficient capital to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.

Table of

From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities and new markets where our partners bring development and operational expertise and/or experience to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.

In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.

Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Unconsolidated Investments - Operating Communities 

As of December 31, 2020, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting, excluding development joint ventures. Refer to Note 5, “Investments in Real Estate Entities,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. For ventures holding operating apartment communities as of December 31, 2020, detail of the real estate and associated indebtedness underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands).

(1)

We have not guaranteed the debt of these unconsolidated investees and bear no responsibility for the repayment.

(2)

Borrowing on this community is comprised of two mortgage loans. The interest rate is the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2020.

(3)

Borrowing on this dual-branded community is comprised of a single mortgage loan.

(4)

Borrowing is comprised of a loan made by the equity investors in the venture in proportion to their equity interests.

During 2020, the U.S. Fund sold one community containing 70 apartment homes and 9,000 square feet of commercial space for $65,000,000. Our share of the gain in accordance with GAAP was $5,157,000. In conjunction with the disposition of the community, the U.S. Fund repaid $27,117,000 of secured indebtedness at par.

Unconsolidated Investments - Development Communities 

During 2020, we entered into a joint venture to develop, own and operate AVA Arts District, an apartment community located in Los Angeles, CA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 475 apartment homes and 56,000 square feet of commercial space when completed. We own a 25.0% interest in the venture with a total expected equity investment of $27,600,000, of which $19,500,000 has already been contributed. The venture has secured a $165,600,000 variable rate construction loan to fund approximately 60% of the development of AVA Arts District of which no amounts have been drawn as of December 31, 2020. The venture will commence draws under the loan subsequent to required equity contributions by the venture partners. We have guaranteed the construction loan on behalf of the venture, and any obligations we may incur under the construction loan guarantee, except to the extent that our misconduct gave rise to the obligation, are required capital contributions of the partners based on ownership interest.

In addition, we have a 50.0% interest in Avalon Alderwood MF Member, LLC, a joint venture to develop, own, and operate Avalon Alderwood Mall, an apartment community located in Lynnwood, WA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 328 apartment homes when complete. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 5, “Investments in Real Estate Entities,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

Unless otherwise noted, we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities, as referenced in the tables above, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. In the future, in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve.

There are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest.

(2)    Includes ground leases expiring between May 2041 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the ground leases.

(3)     Aggregate finance lease payments include $24,300 in interest costs.

Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “assume,” “project,” “plan,” “may,” “shall,” “will” and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:

•

the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition;

•

our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities;

•

the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment;

•

the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities;

•

the timing and net sales proceeds of condominium sales;

•

the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development;

•

the anticipated operating performance of our communities;

•

cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates;

•

the impact of landlord-tenant laws and rent regulations;

•

our declaration or payment of dividends;

•

our joint venture and discretionary fund activities;

•

our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters;

•

our qualification as a REIT under the Code;

•

the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California, Denver, Colorado, and Southeast Florida, and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general;

•

the availability of debt and equity financing;

•

interest rates;

•

general economic conditions, including the potential impacts from current economic conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic; 

•

trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and

•

the impact of outstanding legal proceedings.

We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements.

Risks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, about which there are many uncertainties, including (i) the duration and severity of the pandemic, (ii) the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and relieve economic distress of consumers, such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent and (iii) the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic. Due to this uncertainty we are not able at this time to estimate the effect of these factors on our business, but the adverse impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be material. In addition, the effects of the pandemic are likely to heighten the following risks, which we routinely face in our business:

•

we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;

•

we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses;

•

construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;

•

we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues;

•

the timing and net proceeds of condominium sales may not equal our current expectations;

•

occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control;

•

financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline, which could limit our pursuit of opportunities;

•

the impact of new landlord-tenant laws and rent regulations may be greater than we expect;

•

our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness;

•

we may be unsuccessful in our management of joint ventures and the REIT vehicles that are used with certain joint ventures; 

•

laws and regulations implementing rent control or rent stabilization, or otherwise limiting our ability to increase rents, charge fees or evict tenants, may impact our revenue or increase our costs;

the possibility that we may choose to pay dividends in our stock instead of cash, which may result in stockholders having to pay taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received, if any.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, “Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cost Capitalization

We capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. 

During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $45,268,000 and $48,168,000 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.

There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. 

We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.

Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. As of December 31, 2020, capitalized pursuit costs associated with Development Rights totaled $55,427,000.

Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment

We evaluate our direct and indirect investments in real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.

We expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. 

Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.
