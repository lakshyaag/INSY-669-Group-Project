>Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview 

We are a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, Intermix, Janie and Jack, and Hill City brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we also use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including buy online pick-up in store, order-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile experiences, are tailored uniquely across our portfolio of brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand. 

We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of February 1, 2020, our operating segments included Old Navy Global, Gap Global, Banana Republic Global, Athleta, and Intermix. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and, therefore, the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment.

On February 28, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into two independently publicly-traded companies. On January 16, 2020, the Company announced it no longer intends to separate as the cost and complexity of splitting into two companies, combined with softer business performance, limited our ability to create appropriate value from separation. The work done to prepare for the separation shone a bright light on potential operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement. As a result, the Company intends to operate in a more rigorous and transformational manner that empowers our growth brands, Old Navy and Athleta, and appropriately focuses on the performance of Banana Republic Global and Gap Global. As part of this transformation, the Company announced that Sonia Syngal, the current president and chief executive officer of Old Navy Global, will become the Company’s president and chief executive officer, effective March 23, 2020. 

For the fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, we incurred separation-related costs of $301 million, substantially all of which was recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. See below for details regarding the nature of the costs incurred:

In addition, on February 28, 2019, the Company announced plans to restructure the specialty fleet and revitalize the Gap brand, including closing about 230 Gap specialty stores during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. The Company believes these actions will drive a healthier specialty fleet and will serve as a more appropriate foundation for brand revitalization. During the two-year period, the Company estimates pre-tax costs associated with these closure actions to be about $250 million to $300 million, with the majority expected to be cash expenditures for lease-related costs. The remaining charges are expected to primarily include employee-related costs and the net impact of write-offs related to long-term assets and liabilities. The Company estimates an annualized sales loss of approximately $625 million as a result of these store closures, with resulting annualized pre-tax savings of about $90 million. For the fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, we incurred specialty fleet restructuring costs of $61 million, which primarily include lease and employee-related costs and were recorded in costs of goods sold and occupancy expenses and operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Our discussions and negotiations with landlords around store closures continue to be difficult, and our ability to execute on our strategy quickly and decisively is challenging. As a result, we expect that the majority of store closures and expenses related to restructuring will occur in fiscal 2020. We continue to focus on rationalizing stores that do not generate sufficient returns to warrant the investments necessary to provide our customers with a differentiated experience. 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard, accounting standards update ("ASU") No. 2016-02 and related amendments (collectively "ASC 842"), using the optional transition method and recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings of $86 million, net of tax. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recording of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of $5.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, as of February 3, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Statement of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

On November 7, 2019, Art Peck stepped down as president and chief executive officer and resigned his position as a director of the Company. Robert J. Fisher, the Company's current chairman of the board of directors, began serving as the Company's president and chief executive officer on an interim basis. On March 5, 2020, the Company announced that Sonia Syngal, the current president and chief executive officer of Old Navy Global, will become the Company’s president and chief executive officer, effective March 23, 2020. On March 12, 2020, the Company announced that Katrina O’Connell will become the Company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer ("CFO"), effective March 23, 2020. The current CFO, Teri List-Stoll, will be stepping down and departing the Company after a transition period.

As part of our transformation and specialty fleet rationalization efforts in fiscal 2019, we reassessed our strategy for flagship stores including an evaluation of whether to exit or sublease certain flagship store locations. For the fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of store assets and operating lease assets related to our flagship stores of 

$73 million

 and 

$223 million

, respectively, which was recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impairment charges are primarily related to the New York specialty flagship stores for Gap and Old Navy in Times Square, after a formal decision was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to pursue exiting those locations.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company purchased a building for $343 million. In addition, as part of a related tax exchange, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company sold a building for $220 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of $191 million.

On March 4, 2019, the Company acquired select assets of Gymboree Group, Inc. related to Janie and Jack, a premium children's clothing brand, through a bankruptcy auction. We purchased intellectual property, and property and equipment at the Janie and Jack store locations. We assumed the leases for the majority of Janie and Jack stores and entered into a separate transaction to purchase Janie and Jack inventory. The purchase price for the net assets acquired was $69 million.

We are facing a period of uncertainty regarding the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on both our projected customer demand and supply chain. At this time, many of our Company-owned and franchise stores globally have been temporarily closed or are operating with reduced store hours due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. We expect material impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, including further spread in other regions, meaningful deterioration from current trends, and potential disruption from any supply chain impacts. During this challenging economic environment we are focused on the following priorities:

•

offering product that is consistently brand-appropriate and on-trend with high customer acceptance and appropriate value perception;

•

restructuring the Gap brand, with emphasis on the specialty fleet globally, to create a healthier, more profitable business;

•

attracting and retaining strong talent in our businesses and functions;

•

increasing the focus on improving operational discipline and efficiency by streamlining operations and processes throughout the organization and leveraging our scale; 

•

managing inventory to support a healthy merchandise margin; and

•

Continuing to integrate social and environmental sustainability into business practices to support long term growth.

As of February 1, 2020 cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $1.7 billion. As we manage through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020, we have access to a significant portion of existing cash, as well as our available credit facilities to meet short-term liquidity needs.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2019 and 2018 consisted of 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2017. Net sales and operating results, as well as other metrics derived from the Consolidated Statement of Income, include the impact of the additional week; however, the comparable sales calculation excludes the 53rd week.

A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations when it has been open and operated by the Company for at least one year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp Sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales.

A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open and operated by the Company for less than one year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year.

A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or it is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year.

Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp Sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison.

On March 4, 2019, we acquired select assets of Gymboree Group, Inc. related to Janie and Jack. The 140 stores acquired were not included as store openings for fiscal 2019; however, they are included in the ending number of store locations as of February 1, 2020, net of one closure that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

(3)

Store closures for fiscal 2019 include closures related to our specialty fleet rationalization efforts. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for information about store closing and other operating cost.

Gap and Banana Republic outlet and factory stores are reflected respectively within each brand.

The Company expects to close about 90 company-operated stores, net of openings and repositions in 

fiscal 2020

. This guidance includes about 170 Gap brand store closures globally, the majority of which are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 

fiscal 2020

. The Company continues to expect store openings to be focused on Old Navy and Athleta.

24

Net Sales Discussion

Our net sales for 

fiscal 2019

 decreased 

$197 million

, or 

1 percent

, compared with 

fiscal 2018

. The decrease was primarily driven by negative Gap, Inc. Comp Sales and net store closures at Gap Global, partially offset by the addition of Janie and Jack, new store openings at Old Navy Global, and an increase in net sales at Athleta in part due to new stores. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact of about $61 million for fiscal 2019 and is calculated by translating net sales for fiscal 2018 at exchange rates applicable during fiscal 2019.

Our net sales for 

fiscal 2018

 increased $725 million, or 5 percent, compared with 

fiscal 2017

 primarily driven by the impact of significant presentation changes of $619 million resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and an increase in net sales for Old Navy Global and Athleta; partially offset by a decrease in net sales for Gap Global. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact of about $17 million for fiscal 2018 and is calculated by translating net sales for 

fiscal 2017

 at exchange rates applicable during 

fiscal 2018

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

, which includes $176 million of presentation changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

•

Cost of goods sold increased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, primarily driven by lower product margin at Gap Global and higher online shipping costs. This was partially offset by a favorable impact from presentation changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

•

Occupancy expenses decreased 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, primarily driven by presentation changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

In fiscal 2020, we do not expect significant year-over-year impacts on gross margins due to fluctuations in foreign currencies.

The increase in the effective tax rate for 

fiscal 2019

 compared with 

fiscal 2018

 was primarily due to an adjustment recorded in the current year to increase our fiscal 2017 tax liability for additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the TCJA and an adjustment recorded in fiscal 2018 to reduce our fiscal 2017 provisional estimated net charge related to the TCJA transition tax.

26

The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, enacted as part of the TCJA, and measurement period adjustments to reduce our fiscal 2017 estimated net charge for the effects of the TCJA, offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits recorded in connection with examinations by taxing authorities.

During fiscal 2017, we calculated and recorded a $57 million net charge for our best estimate of the impact of the TCJA one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the impact of TCJA on deferred tax assets and liabilities.

During fiscal 2018, we recorded a $33 million measurement period adjustment to reduce our fiscal 2017 provisional estimated net charge related to the transition tax and recorded certain other immaterial measurement period adjustments to reduce our fiscal 2017 provisional estimated impact of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the TCJA rate reduction. 

During fiscal 2019, we recorded a $30 million adjustment to increase our fiscal 2017 tax liability for additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the TCJA.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and payment of taxes. In addition, we may have dividend payments, debt repayments, and share repurchases.

 held by a third party in connection with the purchase of a building that was completed in fiscal 2019 recorded in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In April 2011, the Company entered into a $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes (the "Notes"), which are due April 2021. Prior to maturity and subject to market conditions, we intend to extinguish our Notes and also intend to enter into a new long-term debt arrangement.

We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our 

$500 million

 unsecured revolving credit facility or other available market instruments. We intend to enter into a new secured revolving credit facility.

We believe that cash flows from operations, along with current cash balances, and the instruments mentioned above will be sufficient to support our near-term liquidity; extensive temporary store closures may require access to additional credit.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $30 million during 

fiscal 2019

 compared with 

fiscal 2018

, primarily due to the following significant changes:

Net income

•

a decrease in net income.

Non-cash items

•

an increase of $239 million due to non-cash impairment charges of operating lease assets in fiscal 2019; partially offset by

•

$191 million decrease due to gain on the sale of a building during fiscal 2019.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

•

an increase of $306 million related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to a significant decrease in bonus accrual in fiscal 2018 combined with an increase in accruals in fiscal 2019 due to separation-related costs;

•

an increase of $158 million related to merchandise inventory primarily due to flat inventory during fiscal 2019 compared with an increase in inventory during fiscal 2018; and

•

an increase of $144 million related to timing of payments for accounts payable.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was flat compared with fiscal 2017, which was comprised of the following significant changes:

Net income

•

an increase in net income.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

•

an increase of $165 million related to income taxes payable, net of prepaid and other tax-related items, driven primarily by the timing of payments; offset by

•

a decrease of $230 million related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities, driven primarily by a decrease in bonus accrual for fiscal 2018 compared with an increase for fiscal 2017; and

•

a decrease of $51 million related to other current assets and long-term assets driven in part by the receipt of insurance claims receivable related to the Fishkill fire during fiscal 2017.

We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities during 

fiscal 2019

 decreased $107 million compared with 

fiscal 2018

, primarily due to the following: 

•

$287 million fewer net purchases of available-for-sale debt securities during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018; and

•

$220 million of proceeds received for the sale of a building during fiscal 2019; partially offset by

•

$343 million purchase of a building during fiscal 2019; and

•

$69 million purchase of Janie and Jack during fiscal 2019.

In 

fiscal 2019

, cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $

702 million

 primarily related to store investments. 

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018 increased $335 million compared with fiscal 2017, primarily due to the following:

•

$287 million of net purchases of available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2018; and

•

$66 million of insurance proceeds allocated to the loss on property and equipment during fiscal 2017.

In 

fiscal 2018

, cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $

705 million

 primarily related to information technology and supply chain to support our omni and digital strategies, and store investments. 

28

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities during 

fiscal 2019

 decreased $189 million compared with 

fiscal 2018

, primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock.

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018 increased $18 million compared with fiscal 2017, primarily due to the following:

•

$83 million higher repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2018; offset by

•

$67 million cash outflow related to the final repayment of the Japan term loan during fiscal 2017.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business and infrastructure. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP result. Free cash flow for fiscal 2017 is adjusted for insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment, as our cash used for purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2017 includes certain capital expenditures related to the rebuilding of the Company-owned distribution center which was impacted by the Fishkill fire.

The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP financial measure.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.

30

Our significant accounting policies can be found under the heading "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in 

Note 1

 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”), with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors), and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCNRV adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the selling price and amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years. 

Leases 

We determine if a long-term contractual obligation is a lease at inception. The majority of our operating leases relate to retail stores. We also lease some of our corporate facilities and distribution centers. Most store leases have a five-year base period and include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial base period, subject to terms agreed upon at lease inception. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 

We record our lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted at the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for our operating leases. This information is dependent upon our credit rating, market information for credit spreads, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. The incremental borrowing rate is also adjusted for each lease’s respective geography.

We recognize operating lease cost over the estimated term of the lease, which includes options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised, starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to the store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the fixed rent, we recognize the related operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition, certain of our lease agreements include variable lease payments, such as payments based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level and/or increases based on a change in the consumer price index or fair market value. These variable lease payments are excluded from minimum lease payments and are included in the determination of net lease cost when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If an operating lease asset is impaired, the remaining operating lease asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.

Note 12

 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for related disclosures.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets 

We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group over the estimated remaining lease term. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The asset group is comprised of both property and equipment and operating lease assets. The asset group for our retail stores is reviewed for impairment at the store level. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and gross profits and estimating useful lives of the assets. For operating lease assets, the Company determines the fair value of the assets by comparing the discounted contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, store closure plans, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. 

See 

Note 7

 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional information and disclosures about impairment of long-lived assets.

We also review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If goodwill is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. 

In connection with the acquisitions of Athleta in September 2008 and Intermix in December 2012, we recorded goodwill that is reviewed for impairment using the applicable reporting unit, which is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed Athleta and Intermix to be the reporting units at which goodwill is tested for Athleta and Intermix, respectively. 

A trade name is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method. 

These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.

See 

Note 4

 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional information and disclosures about impairment of goodwill and trade names.

If actual store and online results and brand performance, real estate market conditions, and economic conditions including interest rates are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in our calculations, we may be exposed to additional impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, or intangible assets that could be material.

32

Income Taxes

We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the geographic mix of income or losses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix and level of income or losses, changes in the expected outcome of audits, changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance, guidance related to the enactment of the TCJA that is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or new tax legislation and guidance.

At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.

We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
