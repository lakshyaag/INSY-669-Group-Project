PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General 

Carrier Global Corporation is a leading global provider of healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. Our portfolio includes industry-leading brands such as Carrier, Kidde, Edwards, LenelS2 and Automated Logic that offer innovative heating, ventilating and air conditioning ("HVAC"), refrigeration, fire, security and building automation technologies to help make the world safer and more comfortable.

Our worldwide operations are affected by global and regional industrial, economic and political factors and trends. These factors and trends include the mega-trends of urbanization, climate change and increasing requirements for food safety driven by the food needs of a growing global population and the rising standards of living in emerging markets. We believe that the Company's HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire & Security business segments are positioned to benefit from favorable secular trends, including these mega-trends, and from the strength of our industry-leading brands and track record of innovation.

On November 26, 2018, United Technologies Corporation, since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation ("UTC"), announced its intention to spin-off Carrier into a separate, publicly traded company (the "Separation"). Carrier was incorporated in Delaware on March 1, 2019, as a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC. On April 3, 2020 (the "Distribution Date"), UTC completed the Separation through a pro rata distribution (the "Distribution") on a one-for-one basis of all of the outstanding common stock of the Company to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the Distribution. UTC distributed 866,158,910 shares of Carrier common stock in the Distribution, which was effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020 (the "Effective Time"). As a result of the Distribution, UTC shareowners of record received one share of the Company’s common stock for every one share of UTC common stock, and Carrier became an independent public company. Our common stock is listed under the symbol "CARR" on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). In connection with the Separation, Carrier issued an aggregate principal balance of $11.0 billion of debt and transferred an aggregate of approximately $10.9 billion of cash to UTC on February 27, 2020 and March 27, 2020. On April 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, Carrier received cash contributions totaling $590 million from UTC related to the Separation. See Note 12 – 

Borrowings and Lines of Credit 

and Note 4 – 

Earnings Per Share

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Our operations for the periods presented herein are classified into three segments: HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire & Security, with each segment comprised of groups of similar operating companies. References to each segment include the various operating companies established worldwide through which the operations for each segment are conducted.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net sales were $17.5 billion, and our operating profit was $3.1 billion. Our net sales for 2020 were derived from the Americas (55%), Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") (30%) and Asia-Pacific (15%). Our international operations, including U.S. export sales, represented approximately 51% of our net sales for 2020. During the same period, new equipment comprised 72% and service and aftermarket comprised 28% of our net sales excluding inter-segment eliminations.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Investors section of our Internet website (http://www.corporate.carrier.com) under the heading "SEC Filings" as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet website (http://www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

Business Strategy

Carrier’s business strategy is to be the world leader in healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. We are focused on three pillars of growth: strengthen and grow our core, increase product extensions and geographic coverage, and grow services and digital to create recurring sales opportunities. The elements of our Company’s strategy encompass the following elements:

Strengthen and grow our core.

 

We are a leader in our three segments. And we are investing in our sales force and research and development to grow that presence.

Our strategy involves driving our organic growth in part by maintaining our proven track record of innovation, which is focused on designing smarter, more connected and more sustainable systems and solutions across our business. Our strategy also relies on our iconic, industry-leading brands and on strengthening our long-term relationships with channel partners and customers by offering solutions that anticipate customer needs related to healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, with a focus on technologies related to refrigerants, efficiency, emissions, air quality, electrification, noise levels and safety.

Increase product extensions and geographic coverage. 

Our strategy involves employing our global operations, the strength of our iconic, industry-leading brands and our success in creating valuable partnerships to focus on targeted expansion into new locations and channels where we believe that we can drive profitable growth. 

We are also focused on emerging trends in our segments; namely, health and safety in homes and commercial buildings, and cold chain solutions. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet the demand expected to result from these trends through products such as our Infinity whole home air purifier and the OptiClean Dual-Mode Air Scrubber & Negative Air Machine for commercial building and home applications, and through products such as Carrier Pods monitored by Sensitech that can help ensure the safe storage and transport of food and medicines. 

Grow services and digital. 

Our strategy is also focused on bringing differentiated parts and service solutions to our customers across the entire product lifecycle. Our new BluEdge platform builds on our history of innovation and our expertise as an original equipment manufacturer. The platform offers a tiered suite of services across our HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire & Security segments. Through our understanding of customer needs and investments in connected equipment and digital service solutions, BluEdge will help us achieve enhanced equipment efficiency and performance – key components of our healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chain programs.

Digital is also central to our growth strategy. We are implementing innovative digital capabilities across our business segments to help differentiate our products and services. Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) is our new preferred cloud provider. Our product teams are deriving insights from data by employing AWS’s services for connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Carrier and AWS are developing new offerings like Lynx, our proprietary intelligent ecosystem that will help optimize the safe and sustainable transport of perishable goods and medicine across the cold chain. Carrier IO, another new proprietary platform, will provide turnkey services to connect equipment and help accelerate product development across our portfolio. In 2020, we implemented new and enhanced e-commerce capabilities and online shop-and-buy offerings to help drive online sales and create an easier, more convenient and engaging customer experience.

Description of Business by Segment

Each segment’s business, including its principal products and services and other material developments and information, is described subsequently. Segment financial data for the years 2018 through 2020, including financial information about U.S. and international sales and operating profits, is included in Note 26 –

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole

Competition and Other Factors Affecting the Carrier Business

As a global business, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section and in the sections entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results" and "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a number of companies in the U.S. and other countries, and each competes on the basis of technology differentiation, product performance, service, delivery schedule, and price. The geographies in which we sell our products, solutions and services in the HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire & Security segments also have a number of local competitors.

HVAC

Competition in HVAC includes several multinational, regional and local companies, the largest of which include Daikin Industries, Gree Electric, Trane Technologies, Johnson Controls, Lennox International, Midea Group and Mitsubishi Electric. Sales depend on price, product availability, delivery schedule, product performance, product line breadth, brand reputation, design, technical expertise and service.

Refrigeration

Competition in Refrigeration includes multinational companies, including Trane Technologies, Daikin Industries and Panasonic, as well as regional and local companies. Sales depend on product performance, efficiency, reliability, price, service and support. The transport refrigeration business is affected by global shipping cycles and by truck production cycles in North America and Europe, which are affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions and replacement cycles.

Fire & Security

Competition in Fire & Security includes several multinational companies, including Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Siemens, Bosch, Assa Abloy, MSA Safety, Stanley Black & Decker and Newell Brands.

Compliance with the Regulation of our Business and Operations

We operate our business and sell our products all over the world. As a result, changes in legislation, regulations and government policies, including with respect to regulations intended to combat climate change, affect our operations and business in the countries, regions and localities in which we operate and sell our products. Such changes, which can also render our products and technologies non-compliant, involve refrigerants, noise levels, product and fire safety, hydro fluorocarbon emissions, fluorinated gases, hazardous substances, and electric and electronic equipment waste. Additionally, the increased fragmentation of regulatory requirements at various levels of government increases our costs because it necessitates the development of country or regional specific variants, monitoring of and compliance with those regulations, and additional testing and certifications. We do not anticipate that these changes will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

Our operations are also subject to and affected by environmental regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and by authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. Most U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal penalties. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with environmental protection laws or that any payments associated with our remediation liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Environmental matters are further addressed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Note 3 –

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

For further discussion of liabilities and risks related to litigation, compliance and environmental matters and other government regulations, see sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 25 – 

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Intellectual Property

We maintain a broad portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our business to protect our research and development investments and to maintain our competitive advantages. We hold approximately 8,000 active patents and pending patent applications worldwide. From time to time, we take actions to protect our business by asserting our intellectual property rights against third-party infringers. We believe that we have taken reasonable measures to build and protect this portfolio of intellectual property rights, but we cannot be assured that these rights will not be challenged, found invalid or unenforceable. See the "Risk Factors" section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of intellectual property matters.

Operating System

We plan to continue to foster operational, financial and commercial excellence to drive sales and earnings growth. With roots in our legacy manufacturing and business processes, the Carrier operating system — Carrier Excellence — is our continuous improvement framework that is expected to drive operational excellence across the company. Our Supplier Excellence program is intended to apply these same operating principles to our supply base. We also implemented a strategic cost reduction initiative in 2020 that initially targeted eliminating $600 million in costs over three years through operational efficiency, digitalization, automation and supply chain productivity. That target has since been increased to $700 million in cost reductions over the same time period.

Raw Materials and Supplies

While we believe that we currently have adequate sources for materials, components and services, we work continuously with our supply base to ensure that we have adequate resources and to reduce costs. Accordingly, we consolidate purchases and suppliers, engage in global sourcing, implement design changes and implement competitive bidding. In certain instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or use commodities, such as rare-earth metals, that can be subject to allocations. Nonetheless, we believe that our supply management practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our business (for example, steel, copper and aluminum) have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee near term unavailability that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, because we have a number of factories and suppliers outside the U.S., the imposition of tariffs or sanctions, or unusually restrictive border-crossing rules, could adversely affect our supply chain. For further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, see the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COVID-19 Pandemic

A novel strain of Coronavirus ("COVID-19") surfaced in late 2019 and has spread throughout the world. In response, in the Spring of 2020, we temporarily closed or reduced production at manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia and Europe for safety reasons and in response to lower demand for our products. Our manufacturing operations have since resumed, measures have been enacted to scale capacity to demand, and we continue to actively take steps to mitigate supply chain risk. We continue to apply appropriate safety measures for our employees and other associates and have not experienced any significant disruptions to our manufacturing operations. We also initiated return-to-work protocols at our non-manufacturing facilities, the employees of which were previously working remotely.

Human Capital Management

As of December 31, 2020, Carrier had approximately 56,000 employees worldwide, of which 35% are located in the Americas, 37% located in EMEA and 28% in Asia.

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 69% of Carrier's approximately 4,600 production and maintenance employees in the U.S. were covered under seven collective bargaining agreements that have expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2023. In the European Union, approximately 19,000 employees are represented by two European Works Councils, and, at national and 

6

Table of Contents

                  

local levels, we inform and consult with 58 local works councils and with unions representing employees at about 40 sites. The Company believes that our relations with our labor unions and works councils are generally good. 

We believe that our employees are our most important asset and that, in turn, our success and growth depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We continuously evaluate, modify and enhance our recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives:

Health & Safety

Our Environmental, Health, and Safety program is focused on eliminating the risk of serious injuries, illness and fatalities to employees, contractors and customers during manufacturing, installation, servicing and other business activities by applying rigorous standards, controls, inspections and audits to help ensure that our operations and premises comply with national and local regulations and Carrier incident reporting requirements. 

In response to COVID-19, we implemented various measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers including work-from-home requirements (where practical), social distancing and deep cleaning protocols at all of our facilities as well as travel restrictions, among other measures, which measures comply with applicable governmental regulations and guidance. 

Competitive Pay, Benefits and Total Rewards and Practices

Carrier's total rewards philosophy is designed to align the compensation of our employees with individual and Company performance, and to provide the appropriate market-competitive incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. In addition, we offer a company-paid assistance program to help employees and their families with mental health and other life challenges. In coordination with each country’s social welfare system, and in addition to any required local health care participation, we may provide additional health and welfare benefits depending on, among other things, the market competitiveness in that country. We also offer a tuition assistance program that is discussed in more detail below (see 

Talent Development and Employee Engagement).

Diversity & Inclusion

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 27% of our employees and 31% of our executives globally were women. As of December 31, 2020, people of color represented approximately 25% of our U.S. executive and 23% of our professional employees in the U.S. 

Our greatest strength is the diversity of our people and their ideas and experiences; diversity and inclusion are the cornerstones of our values and we believe that it is a source of innovation. To this end, we recently launched 

_belong

, our diversity and inclusion philosophy and brand as well as a diversity and inclusion strategy that consists of four tenets – Reduce the Gap, Develop & Sponsor, Drive Inclusion and Lean Forward – which include a focus on recruiting, development and mentoring activities. We also sponsor multiple Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"), such as Pride, Carrier Black Alliance, WE (Women Empowerment at Carrier), CHEER (Carrier Hispanic & Latinos Employee Engagement Resource group), and Veterans & Military. These ERGs operate with a formal leadership structure, a steering committee, senior leadership sponsorship and a defined mission statement that is aligned with supporting Carrier’s business strategy. We also have established multi-year relationships with two historically Black colleges and universities that include career and recruiting initiatives.

Talent Development and Employee Engagement

The Company is committed to the continued development and engagement of our people. We promote continuous learning by offering a company-sponsored Employee Scholar Program, which covers the cost of an employee's tuition, academic fees and books at approved universities. We conduct annual leadership development reviews, a process through which senior leaders identify future leaders and discuss strengths and development opportunities, fostering succession planning for key leadership positions. We also have developed various talent development programs, such as internships, early career rotational programs and a suite of development programs for current and future leaders during the three critical stages of their careers – early career, mid-career and senior leadership.

Table of Contents

                  

Three-times per year we conduct an anonymous online survey in local languages to solicit feedback from our employees. The results are reviewed by the Company’s senior leadership and shared with our managers and other employees – all of whom collaborate to identify areas for improvement.

Joint Ventures and Strategic Relationships

Our joint ventures and strategic relationships are an important part of our business. We hold interests in approximately 60 joint ventures, the financial results of which are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements or accounted for by the equity method of accounting or the cost basis of accounting. While all three of our segments participate in joint ventures and strategic relationships, most are in the HVAC segment. These relationships engage in distribution, manufacturing and product development activities and are integral to our business operations and growth strategy. See Note 6 – 

Equity Method Investments and Related Parties 

in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Seasonality

Demand for certain of our products and services is seasonal and can be impacted by weather conditions. For instance, sales and services of our HVAC products to residential customers have historically been higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, which represent the peak seasons for air conditioning-related sales in North America. For further discussion of the possible effects of seasonality on our business, see the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Corporate Information

Carrier was incorporated in Delaware in connection with the Separation. Prior to the Distribution, Carrier had no operations other than those incidental to the Separation. Our principal executive offices are located at 13995 Pasteur Boulevard, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida 33418, and our telephone number is (561) 365-2000. We maintain an Internet website at

We may not realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, and our profitability or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.

•

Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results.

•

We are subject to litigation, environmental and other legal and compliance risks.

•

We are subject to risks arising from doing business with the U.S. government.

•

We engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures.

•

We may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and certain other intangible assets.

•

Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to the capital markets.

•

We incurred debt obligations, and we may incur additional debt obligations in the future, which could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations.

Risks Related to the Separation from UTC

•

We have only operated as an independent company since April 3, 2020, the effective date of the Distribution, and our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. Additionally, we are a smaller, less diversified company than UTC prior to the Separation and the Distribution.

•

After the Separation and the Distribution, certain members of management, directors and shareowners own stock in UTC, Carrier and Otis Worldwide Corporation ("Otis"), and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.

•

We could experience temporary interruptions in business operations and incur additional costs as we further develop information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our stand-alone systems.

•

We may not be able to engage in desirable capital-raising or strategic transactions following the Separation and the Distribution.

•

In connection with the Separation into three independent public companies, each of UTC, Carrier and Otis have agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay UTC and/or Otis under these indemnities, 

10

Table of Contents

                  

our financial results could be negatively impacted. Also, the UTC or Otis indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which UTC and Otis have been allocated responsibility, and UTC and/or Otis may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future.

•

If the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock or the stock of UTC, we, as well as UTC, Otis and UTC’s shareowners, could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, if certain internal restructuring transactions were to fail to qualify as transactions that are generally tax-free for U.S. federal or non-U.S. income tax purposes, we, as well as UTC and Otis could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify UTC for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement ("TMA").

•

Potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

•

The market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.

•

Shareowner's percentage of ownership in Carrier's common stock may be diluted in the future.

•

Quarterly cash dividends may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock.

•

Our amended and restated bylaws designate the state courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareowners, which could discourage lawsuits against Carrier and our directors and officers.

•

Anti-takeover provisions could enable our Board of Directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareowners.

General Risks

•

Natural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be fully covered by insurance.

•

We may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions, and conditions in the construction, transportation and infrastructure industries in particular.

•

Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.

•

Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability.

•

Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us.

RISK FACTORS

Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth subsequently, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. 

Risks Related to Our Business

Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19.

The global outbreak of COVID-19 has severely constrained economic activity and, as a result, has caused a significant contraction in the global economy. In response to this outbreak, governments have taken preventive or protective actions, including imposing restrictions on business operations and travel. Governments have also implemented economic stabilization efforts and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the outbreak; however, the effectiveness and continuation of those measures remains uncertain.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The pandemic continues to result in widespread and extended or partial shutdowns and other restrictions on the operations of non-essential businesses, including construction, hospitality venues, offices and travel. The nature and extent of the continuing impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the recent and pending approvals of vaccines, the wide-spread distribution of vaccines and the effectiveness of such vaccines in preventing COVID-19, and the time it takes to vaccinate a sufficient percentage of the U.S. and global populations. Nonetheless, further prolonged closures and restrictions throughout the world or the rollback of 

11

Table of Contents

                  

reopening measures due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and continued decreases in the general level of economic activity may again disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, distributors and customers. 

As a result of the foregoing, the pandemic and its impact have also affected and could continue to affect the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services and to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, which has resulted in, and could further result in, a decrease and/or cancellation of orders and/or payment delays or defaults. Such conditions may also adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to fulfill orders on time or at the anticipated cost. We also may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our results of operations and our credit ratings. There is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We have a global business. Approximately 51% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 is derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. As a result, changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuating exchange rates, may adversely affect demand for our products and the profits generated by our non-U.S. operations because a significant portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. While we attempt to manage our exchange rate risk, we are not completely insulated from that exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could reduce our operating margins in various locations outside of the U.S., which would adversely impact the comparability of our results from period to period.

Our international sales and operations are also subject to the risks associated with changes in local government regulations and policies regarding investments, employment, taxation, foreign exchange and capital controls and the repatriation of earnings. Moreover, government regulations and policies regarding international trade, such as import quotas, punitive taxes or tariffs or similar trade barriers, whether imposed by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or services or encumber our ability to manufacture or sell or procure products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies by the U.S. or by other countries, such as China and Mexico, where we sell or produce our products and services or procure materials, including as a result of the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to political and economic instability, changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets, and the risks associated with differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries.

We expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as developing nations around the world increase their demand for our products. In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Mexico, Brazil, China, India and countries in the Middle East. Emerging markets can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), compliance risks, economic and government instability, exchange rate fluctuations and the imposition of foreign exchange and capital controls. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We are party to joint ventures and other strategic relationships, which may not be successful and may expose us to special risks and restrictions.

Our business operations, particularly in our HVAC segment, depend on various strategic relationships: namely, joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries. We sell our products and services through certain key distributor, joint venture and similar relationships, including the Carrier Enterprise joint ventures with Watsco, Inc.; AHI-Carrier FZC ("AHI-Carrier"), a United Arab Emirates-based joint venture with Airconditioning & Heating International FZC, a subsidiary of United Motors & Heavy Equipment Co. LLC; various joint ventures with members of the Midea Group; and Toshiba Carrier, a joint venture with Toshiba with which we have several other joint ventures.

Some of our strategic relationships engage in manufacturing and/or product development. Loss of a key channel partner, or a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key channel partner, joint venture or similar 

12

Table of Contents

                  

relationship, whether related to, among other things, a labor strike, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for products or delays in the launch of new products, could adversely affect our results of operations in a particular period or the value of our equity investment. If we are not successful in maintaining our strategic distribution relationships, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.

In addition, our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to our joint ventures is limited and can expose us to additional financial and reputational risks. We seek to take proactive steps to mitigate these concerns, including through audits and similar reviews. During one such recent audit, for example, Carrier identified certain payments made to AHI-Carrier over a ten-year period for products sold in the ordinary course by that minority-owned joint venture from entities of undetermined affiliation with AHI-Carrier’s distributors and customers, predominantly based in countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Carrier does not manage the joint venture and does not direct its treasury or related functions; however, Carrier exercised our audit rights under the joint venture agreement and investigated these third-party payments. As previously disclosed, the Company reported the preliminary findings of our investigation to the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice in February 2020. In December 2020, the SEC informed the Company that it had concluded its investigation of the matter and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action.

Joint ventures and strategic relationships inherently involve certain other risks. Whether or not we hold a majority interest or maintain operational control in such arrangements, our partners and similar business associates may, for example: (1) have economic or business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with or contrary to our own; (2) exercise veto or other rights, to the extent available, to block actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture’s best interests; (3) act contrary to our policies or objectives; or (4) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations.

In addition, there can be no assurance that any particular joint venture or strategic relationship will continue to be beneficial to us in the long term. For example, some of our joint venture or other strategic agreements prohibit us from competing in certain geographic markets or product and services channels, and these restrictions may apply to other products and services we develop or businesses we acquire in the future.

Climate change and regulations associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.

The effects of climate change, including extreme weather conditions, create financial risks to our business. The effects of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other operating costs. The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them.

There is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert its worst effects. As a result, increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to (1) generate more international, regional and/or national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants (which are essential to many of our products); (2) increase building energy efficiency; and (3) cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source. In some instances, these requirements may render our existing technology, particularly some of our HVAC and refrigeration products, non-compliant or obsolete. While we are committed to pursuing sustainable solutions for our products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, as noted below (see 

We design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated.

), that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position, or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development.

The inconsistent international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate change regulations also create economic and regulatory uncertainty. There is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued, could adversely impact the demand for energy-efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance.

Demand for our HVAC products and services is influenced by weather conditions and seasonality.

Demand for our HVAC products and services, representing our largest segment by sales, is seasonal and affected by the weather. Cooler than normal summers depress sales of our replacement air conditioning products and services and warmer than 

13

Table of Contents

                  

normal winters have the same effect on our heating products. Historically, sales to residential HVAC customers tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because, in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere regions, spring and summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services. In these circumstances, the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year, and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect our business and impact overall results of operations.

Our business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure, which may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks.

The efficient operation of our business requires continued and substantial investments in information technology ("IT") infrastructure systems. The failure to design, develop and implement new IT technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to maintain these systems could divert management’s attention and resources. Our information systems may also become obsolete because of inadequate investments, requiring an unplanned transition to a new platform that could be time consuming, costly, and damaging to our competitive position and could require additional management attention. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service because of poor execution, inadequate investments or obsolescence could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services. 

In addition, our business may be impacted by disruptions to our or third-party IT infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks, infrastructure failures or compromises to our physical security. Cyber-based risks are evolving and include attacks: (i) on our IT infrastructure (ii) targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of hardware and software; (iii) on information installed, stored or transmitted in our products (including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into third-party products); and (iv) on facilities or similar infrastructure. Such attacks could disrupt our systems (or those of third parties) and business operations, impact the ability of our products to work as intended or result in the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information in violation of applicable law and/or contractual obligations. We have experienced cyber-based attacks and, due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency or severity. We continue to make investments and adopt measures to enhance our protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services, operations and confidential data. However, depending on the nature, sophistication and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. As a result, we could potentially experience: (i) production downtimes; (ii) operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations; (iii) destruction or corruption of data; (iv) security breaches; (v) manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products; and (vi) financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation—any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted.

In addition, because of the global nature of our business, our internal systems and products must comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards in a number of jurisdictions, and government enforcement actions and violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws could be costly or interrupt our business operations. Any disruption to our business arising from such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated, could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers. Infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success.

The Company's intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes and other confidential information. Although we consider our intellectual property rights in the aggregate to be valuable, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them. We nonetheless rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, customer and supplier agreements, license agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information may not be sufficient, however. 

We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be 

14

Table of Contents

                  

found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. 

In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession, ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or sale of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. Any of these events or factors could subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, and third-party service providers in our business. Significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or production disruptions, price increases, or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.

Our reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials (such as copper, aluminum and steel), and on service providers to deliver our products, exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services. That potential volatility is particularly acute in certain instances where we depend upon a single source. Issues with suppliers (such as delivery or production disruptions, capacity constraints, quality issues, consolidations, closings or bankruptcies), price increases, raw material shortages, or the decreased availability of trucks and other delivery services could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. 

We use various strategies to lock in prices of expected purchases of certain raw materials; however, these efforts could cause us to pay higher prices for a commodity when compared with the market price at the time the commodity is actually purchased or delivered. Tariffs can also increase our costs, the impact of which is difficult to predict. However, we believe that our supply management and production practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, these risks may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated.

Our future success depends on designing, developing, producing, selling and supporting innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The regulations applicable to our products, as well as our customers’ product and service needs, change from time to time. Moreover, regulatory changes may render our products and technologies non-compliant. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements or product improvements – including those associated with regulatory changes – depends on a variety of factors, including: meeting development, production, and regulatory approval schedules; meeting performance plans and expectations; the availability of raw materials and parts; our suppliers’ performance; the hiring, training and deployment of qualified personnel; achieving efficiencies; identifying emerging regulatory and technological trends; validating innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and the costs and customer acceptance of our new or improved products.

Our products and services also may incorporate technologies developed or manufactured by third parties, which, when combined with our technology or products, creates additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and market acceptance of these third-party products and services could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace.

Our research and development efforts may not culminate in new technologies or timely products, or may not meet the needs of our customers as effectively as competitive offerings. Our competitors may develop competing technologies that gain market acceptance before or instead of our products. In addition, we may not be successful in anticipating or reacting to changes in the regulatory environments in which our products are sold, and the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we anticipate.

We operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services

.

15

Table of Contents

                  

In certain of our businesses, our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other factors, the cost to timely provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return, we must accurately estimate our costs and schedule. If we fail to do so, the profitability of contracts may be materially and adversely affected – including because some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform on time – which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Customers and others may take disruptive actions.

From time to time customers and others may seek to become suppliers of products and services that compete with our own or pursue other strategies to disrupt our business model. For example, an affiliate of a customer in our transport refrigeration business produces refrigeration units for shipping containers that compete with our products, and another one of our transport refrigeration customers produces refrigeration units for truck trailers that compete with our refrigeration units. In addition, our customers or existing or future competitors may seek to introduce non-traditional business models or disruptive technologies and products in the industries in which we participate, resulting in increased competition and new dynamics in these industries.

Labor matters may impact our business.

A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions or works councils in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. See the section entitled "Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole - Human Capital Management." We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these agreements before they expire. In addition, existing agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our specific business or collective bargaining agreements. Additionally, a shortage in certain work forces, such as technicians or truck drivers, may impact our business by affecting the ability to install, sell and deliver our products. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, productivity, results of operations and reputation.

Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results.

The performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. See Note 13 – 

Employee Benefit Plans

 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies.

We may not realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, and our profitability or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.

In order to operate more efficiently and cost effectively, we have and we may from time to time to adjust employment levels, optimize our footprint and/or implement other restructuring activities. These activities are complex and may involve or require significant changes to our operations. If we do not successfully manage these activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include: unfavorable political responses and reputational harm; unforeseen delays in the implementation of the restructuring activities; additional costs; adverse effects on employee morale; the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages; and difficulty managing our operations during or after facility consolidations, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, harm our business or reputation, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results.

Product and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands. If certain of our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards – which has been the case – or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality, we can and have experienced lost sales and increased costs and we can and have been exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to 

16

Table of Contents

                  

litigation as well as government enforcement actions, which has also occurred in certain instances. In addition, when our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability claims, personal injury and other claims.

We maintain strict quality controls and procedures. However, we cannot be certain that these controls and procedures will reveal defects in our products or their raw materials, which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that products will have defects, which could require a product recall or field corrective action. Product recalls and field corrective actions can be expensive to implement, and may damage our reputation, customer relationships and market share. We have conducted product recalls and field corrective actions in the past and may do so again in the future.

In many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products, which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recalls, repair and replacement costs.

We are subject to litigation, environmental, and other legal and compliance risks.

We are subject to a variety of litigation, legal and compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, taxes, environmental matters, employee health and safety, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. If found responsible in connection with such matters, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments and other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), and experience reputational harm.

As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we operate, structure our investments and enforce our rights.

Changes in environmental and climate change related-laws could require additional investments in product designs, which may be more expensive or difficult to manufacture, qualify and sell and/or may involve additional product safety risks and could increase environmental compliance expenditures.

 

At times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and property damage. Existing and future asbestos-related claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions. Property damage lawsuits may involve claims relating to environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations or where certain of our products have been manufactured and used.

In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Certain of our or our channel partners' customer relationships are with governmental entities and are, therefore, subject to the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to antitrust, anti-collusion and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions throughout the world. Despite meaningful measures to ensure lawful conduct, which include training, audits and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always be able to prevent our employees, third-party agents or channel partners from violating the FCPA or anti-trust, anti-money laundering or other anti-corruption laws. As a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, as well as disgorgement. We could be required to make changes or enhancements to our compliance measures that could increase our costs, and we could be subject to other remedial actions. 

17

Table of Contents

                  

Violations of the FCPA, antitrust, anti-money laundering or other anti-corruption or anti-collusion laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We also must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include, amongst others, the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Restrictions on the export of our products, services or technologies could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

For a description of current material legal proceedings and regulatory matters, see the section entitled "Legal Proceedings" and Note 25 – 

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are subject to risks arising from doing business with the U.S. government.

As a supplier and service provider to the U.S. government, including as a subcontractor under prime contracts with the U.S. government, we are subject to certain heightened risks, such as those associated with the Government’s rights to audit and conduct investigations and with its rights to terminate contracts for convenience or default. We are now, and in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of U.S. government investigations relating to our U.S. government contracts or subcontracts. Such investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if a business unit were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts or subcontracts. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could fine and debar us from receiving new awards for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated.

We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures.

We seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to organic growth. In the past several years, we have acquired various businesses and entered into joint venture arrangements in an effort to complement and expand our business. We expect to continue such pursuits in the future. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. For example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities, or reduced sales, as a result of an acquisition’s violation of applicable laws, such as the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws outside of the U.S. We also may incur – and have incurred – unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges and expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. We may encounter – and have encountered – difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations, applying our internal controls to these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, we may not realize – and have sometimes not realized – the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses.

We also make strategic divestitures from time to time. Our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees, other financial arrangements, continued supply and services arrangements or through the retention of liabilities, such as for environmental and product liability claims. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses or claims against retained liabilities could result in the imposition of obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.

The success of future acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to such transactions and the timing of consummation of such transactions, which will depend in part on the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things.

We may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and certain other intangible assets.

We may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Our other intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks. As of December 31, 2020, the net carrying value of our goodwill and certain other intangible assets totaled $10.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, planned or unexpected significant changes in the use of the assets, and sustained market capitalization declines may result in the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment is recognized.

Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to the capital markets.

Carrier has been issued an investment grade credit rating by each of Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor’s ("S&P") and Fitch Ratings Inc. ("Fitch Ratings"). Nonetheless, any future downgrades could increase our borrowing costs, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to the capital markets. Additionally, our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. 

We incurred debt obligations, and we may incur additional debt obligations in the future, which could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations.

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $10.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness. See Note 12 – 

Borrowings and Lines of Credit 

in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section entitled "Liquidity and Financial Condition" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.

Our debt obligations could potentially have important consequences to us and our debt and equity investors, including: (1) requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments; (2) making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations; (3) increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; (4) increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (5) reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; (6) limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; (7) placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and (8) limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase shares.

As described in Note 12 – 

Borrowings and Lines of Credit 

in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Liquidity and Financial Condition" the terms of our indebtedness contain covenants restricting our financial flexibility in a number of ways, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur liens, to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility (defined subsequently) requires that we not exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, subject to the amendment also described in Note 12 – 

Borrowings and Lines of Credit. 

If we breach a restrictive covenant under any of our indebtedness, or an event of default occurs in respect of any of our indebtedness, our lenders may be entitled to declare all amounts owing in respect thereof to be immediately due and payable. 

To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the foregoing risks could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.

Risks Related to the Separation from UTC

We have only operated as an independent company since April 3, 2020, the effective date of the Distribution, and our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results; additionally, we are a smaller, less diversified company than UTC prior to the Separation and the Distribution. 

The historical information about Carrier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods prior to April 3, 2020 refers to Carrier's businesses as operated by and integrated with UTC. Our historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of UTC. Prior to the Separation and the Distribution, our business had been operated by UTC as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. As part of UTC, we were able to enjoy certain benefits from UTC’s operating diversity, purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with UTC’s other businesses. Additionally, UTC or one of its affiliates performed or helped perform various corporate functions for us, such as accounting, auditing, tax, legal, human resources, investor relations, risk management, treasury and other general and administrative functions. Accordingly, the financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods prior to April 3, 2020 does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company or those that we will achieve in the future. 

In addition, the diversification of our sales, costs and cash flows are diminished as a stand-alone company, such that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished. As a stand-alone Company, we may also lose capital allocation efficiency and flexibility because we are no longer able to use cash flows from UTC or Otis to fund our investments and operations. 

After the Separation and the Distribution, certain members of management, directors and shareowners own stock in UTC, Carrier and Otis, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.

Following the Separation and the Distribution, certain members of management and the board of directors of each of UTC, Carrier and Otis own common stock in all three companies. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other two companies. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and Carrier’s relationship with UTC and Otis thereafter. These agreements include a separation and distribution agreement, the TSA, the TMA, the employee matters agreement, the intellectual property agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or UTC may enter into in the future. See Note 1 – 

Description of the Business

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. 

We could experience temporary interruptions in business operations and incur additional costs as we further develop information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our stand-alone systems.

We are in the process of finalizing development of an IT infrastructure and systems to support our critical business functions, including accounting and reporting, in order to replace many of the systems and functions UTC provided prior to the Separation and the Distribution. We may experience temporary disruption in our business operations as we continue to develop this IT infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, our costs for the operation of these systems may be higher than the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods prior to April 3, 2020.

We may not be able to engage in desirable capital-raising or strategic transactions following the Separation and the Distribution.

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a spin-off that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its shareowners as a result of certain post-spin-off transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Separation and the Distribution, and in addition to Carrier’s indemnity obligation described subsequently, the TMA restricts us, for the two-year period following the Distribution, except in specific circumstances, from: (1) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the 

20

Table of Contents

                  

shares of Carrier common stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise; (2) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds; (3) repurchasing shares of Carrier common stock other than in certain open-market transactions; and (4) ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses. The TMA also prohibits us from taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the Distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or for applicable non-U.S. income tax purposes. Further, the TMA imposes similar restrictions on us and our subsidiaries during the two-year period following the Distribution that are intended to prevent certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization from failing to qualify as transactions that are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code or for applicable non-U.S. income tax purposes. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases or other transactions that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our shareowners or that might increase the value of our business. See Note 1 – 

Description of the Business

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

In connection with the Separation into three independent public companies, each of UTC, Carrier and Otis has agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay UTC and/or Otis under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Also, the UTC or Otis indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which UTC and Otis have been allocated responsibility, and UTC and/or Otis may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future.

Pursuant to the Separation and the Distribution agreement and certain other agreements among UTC, Carrier and Otis, each party has agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities as discussed further in Note 1 – 

Description of the Business

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnities that we may be required to provide UTC and/or Otis are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that UTC and/or Otis has agreed to retain. The indemnities from UTC and Otis for our benefit may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and UTC and/or Otis may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to such indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business.

Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from UTC or Otis, as applicable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

If the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock or the stock of UTC, we, as well as UTC, Otis and UTC’s shareowners, could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, if certain internal restructuring transactions were to fail to qualify as transactions that are generally tax-free for U.S. federal or non-U.S. income tax purposes, we, as well as UTC and Otis could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify UTC for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the TMA.

The Distribution was conditioned on, among other things, the receipt by UTC of an IRS ruling regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and the Distribution and an opinion of outside counsel, regarding the qualification of certain elements of the Distribution under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of UTC, Carrier and Otis, including those relating to the past and future conduct of UTC, Carrier and Otis.

Notwithstanding receipt of the IRS ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS ruling or the opinion of counsel was based were inaccurate or have not been complied with. In addition, the IRS ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court, and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by UTC of the IRS ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including by reason of the consummation of Raytheon Company's merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of UTC 

21

Table of Contents

                  

shortly after the Effective Time) or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, we, as well as UTC, Otis and UTC’s shareowners, could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.

If the Distribution were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, UTC would recognize a taxable gain as if it had sold the Carrier common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and UTC shareowners who received Carrier common stock in the Distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares. Even if the Distribution were to otherwise qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it may result in taxable gain to UTC (but not its shareowners) under Section 355(e) of the Code if the Distribution were deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in UTC or Carrier. For this purpose, any acquisitions of UTC or Carrier common stock within the period beginning two years before the Distribution and ending two years after the Distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan, although UTC or Carrier may be able to rebut that presumption (including by qualifying for one or more safe harbors under applicable Treasury Regulations). 

In addition, as part of the Separation, and prior to the Distribution, UTC and its subsidiaries completed an internal reorganization. With respect to certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization, UTC requested and obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of such transactions. Such tax rulings and opinions were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations (including with respect to certain valuation matters relating to the internal reorganization), statements and undertakings of UTC, Carrier, Otis or their respective subsidiaries. If any of these representations or statements were, or were to become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if UTC, Carrier, Otis or any of their respective subsidiaries did not fulfill or otherwise comply with any such undertakings or covenants, such tax rulings and/or opinions may be invalid or the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Further, notwithstanding receipt of any such tax rulings and/or opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant transactions differs from the conclusions reached in the relevant tax rulings and/or opinions. In the event any such tax rulings and/or opinions or the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant transaction, we, as well as UTC and Otis could be subject to significant tax liabilities.

Under the TMA, Carrier is generally required to indemnify UTC and Otis for any taxes resulting from the Separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from: (1) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Carrier, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (2) other actions or failures to act by Carrier or (3) certain of Carrier’s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Further, under the TMA, we are generally required to indemnify UTC and Otis for a specified portion of any taxes (and any related costs and other damages) (a) arising as a result of the failure of the Distribution and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free (including as a result of Section 355(e) of the Code) or a failure of any internal separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to so qualify, in each case, to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier, Otis or UTC or (b) arising from an adjustment, pursuant to an audit or other tax proceeding, with respect to any separation transaction that is not intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. See Note 1 – 

Description of the Business

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with the Separation (including the internal reorganization described previously), UTC completed several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which, along with the Distribution, may be subject to various fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws. If, under these laws, a court were to determine that, at the time of the Separation, any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the Separation: (1) was insolvent, was rendered insolvent by reason of the Separation, or had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital, and (2) received less than fair consideration in exchange for the Distribution; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured, then the court could void the Separation and the Distribution, in whole or in part, as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. The court could then require our shareowners to return to UTC some or all of the shares of Carrier common stock issued in the Distribution, or require UTC or Carrier, as the case may be, to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit 

22

Table of Contents

                  

of creditors. The measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Carrier or any of our subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Distribution.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

The market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.

The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur.

The factors that could affect our common stock price include among others: (1) industry or general market conditions; (2) domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; (3) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; (4) lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities; (5) changes in our customers’ preferences; (6) new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; (7) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; (8) changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts; (9) action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders; (10) failure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices; (11) announcements by us of significant impairment charges; (12) speculation in the press or investment community; (13) investor perception of us and our industry; (14) changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; (15) announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships; (16) war or terrorist acts; (17) any future sales of our common stock or other securities; and (18) additions or departures of key personnel.

The stock markets have experienced volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

Shareowner's percentage of ownership in Carrier's common stock may be diluted in the future.

The percentage ownership of shareowners in Carrier's common stock may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have, and will receive from Carrier, stock-based awards that correspond to shares of our common stock. Such awards have had and will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See Note 4 – 

Earnings Per Share

 and Note 14 – 

Stock-Based Compensation

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Quarterly cash dividends may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock.

Quarterly cash dividends are a component of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with operating free cash flows, borrowings and divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends. Dividends may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends may vary from past practice or from the company’s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Our amended and restated bylaws designate the state courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareowners, which could discourage lawsuits against Carrier and our directors and officers.

Carrier’s amended and restated bylaws provide that unless Carrier’s Board of Directors otherwise determines, the state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Carrier, any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of Carrier to Carrier or to Carrier shareowners, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against Carrier or any current or former director or officer or other employee of Carrier arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, any action asserting a claim relating to or involving Carrier governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), although Carrier shareowners will not be deemed to have waived Carrier’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable.

This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareowners to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareowners find favorable for disputes with Carrier or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against Carrier and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described previously, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Anti-takeover provisions could enable our Board of Directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareowners.

Carrier’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Carrier’s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: (1) the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on Carrier’s Board of Directors (except in an instance where a director is removed by shareowners and the resulting vacancy is filled by shareowners); (2) limitations on shareowners’ ability to call a special shareowner meeting; (3) rules regarding how shareowners may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareowner meetings; and (4) the right of Carrier’s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareowner approval.

In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that shareowners may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock.

We believe these provisions will protect our shareowners from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with Carrier’s Board of Directors and by providing Carrier’s Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make Carrier immune from takeovers; however, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareowners and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Carrier’s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Carrier and our shareowners. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 

24

Table of Contents

                  

In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our common stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, causing the distribution to be taxable to UTC. Under the TMA, we are required to indemnify UTC for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our shareowners may consider favorable.

General Risks

Natural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance. 

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events, including hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods and other forms of severe weather, health epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other contagious outbreaks, conflicts, wars or terrorist acts, in the U.S. or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could damage or close one or more of our facilities or disrupt our operations temporarily or long-term, such as by causing business interruptions or by affecting the availability and/or cost of materials needed for manufacturing. In some cases, we have only one factory that can manufacture a specific product or product line. As a result, damage to or the closure of that factory may disrupt or prevent us from manufacturing certain products. Existing insurance arrangements may not cover all of the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events. The occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales.

We may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions, and conditions in the construction, transportation and infrastructure industries in particular.

Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks and conditions, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, fluctuations in residential, commercial and industrial construction activity, pandemic health issues (including COVID-19 and its effects), natural disasters, commodity prices, energy costs, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies (including tariffs, boycotts and sanctions), regulatory changes, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy.

These economic and political conditions affect our business in a number of ways. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact the global economy remains uncertain, but pandemics or other significant public health events, or the perception that such events may occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the tightening of credit in the capital markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers, including individual end-customers and businesses, to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, which could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services. Similarly, tightening credit may adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Additionally, because we have a number of factories and suppliers in foreign countries, the imposition of tariffs or sanctions or unusually restrictive border crossing rules could adversely affect our supply chain, operations and overall business.

Our business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending and construction (both residential and commercial as well as remodeling). In addition, our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment, including truck production cycles in North America and Europe.

Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 

Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have leadership with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives, execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership.

Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions. Changes to tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations or other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject 

25

Table of Contents

                  

to examinations by various tax authorities. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions could also launch new examinations and expand existing examinations. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue, and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty.

See "Business Overview" and "Results of Operations—Income Taxes" under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 3 – 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 and Note 19 – 

Income Taxes

 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies, including our provisional accounting and assessment of the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA").

Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that, among other things, we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting until we file our first Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, at which time we will be an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer; accordingly, we expect this attestation at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal controls over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting when required. 

Matters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in our company and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could have a material and adverse effect on us by, for example, leading to a decline in the share price of our common stock and impairing our ability to raise additional capital.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We operate approximately 1,200 sites, which comprise approximately 35 million square feet of productive space. Of these, our facilities and key manufacturing sites greater than 100,000 square feet comprise approximately 24 million square feet of productive space. Approximately 60%, 15% and 21% of these significant properties are associated with our HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire & Security segments, respectively, with approximately 4% not associated with a particular segment. Approximately 32% of these significant properties are leased and the remainder are owned. Approximately 30% of these significant properties are located in the U.S.

Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2020 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities, such as warehouses and machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment that use special jigs, tools and fixtures and that, in many instances, have automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2020 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are generally in regular use.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

Asbestos Matters

The Company and our consolidated subsidiaries have been named as defendants in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos allegedly integrated into certain Carrier products or business premises. While the Company has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it into any currently-manufactured products, certain products that Carrier no longer manufactures contained components incorporating asbestos. A substantial majority of these asbestos-related claims have been dismissed without payment or were covered in full or in part by insurance or other forms of indemnity. Additional cases were litigated and settled without any insurance reimbursement. The amounts involved in asbestos-related claims were not material individually or in the aggregate in any period. 

The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities are based on currently available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable and are made with input from outside actuarial experts. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated range of liability to resolve all pending and unasserted potential future asbestos claims through 2059 is approximately $245 million to $276 million. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. We have recorded the minimum amount of $245 million and $255 million, which is principally recorded in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts are undiscounted and exclude the Company’s legal fees to defend the asbestos claims, which are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company has an insurance recovery receivable for probable asbestos-related recoveries of approximately $103 million and 

$104 million

, which is included primarily in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Aqueous Film Forming Foam Litigation

Aqueous Film Forming Foam ("AFFF") is a firefighting foam developed in the 1970s pursuant to U.S. military specification and used to extinguish certain types of fires primarily at airports and military bases. AFFF was manufactured by several companies, including National Foam and Angus Fire. UTC acquired the National Foam and Angus Fire businesses in 2005 as part of the acquisition of Kidde, which has been operated by Carrier. In 2013, UTC divested the National Foam and Angus Fire businesses to a third party.

Carrier and many other parties, including the third-party buyer of the National Foam and Angus Fire businesses, have been named as defendants in over 700 cases, including putative class actions and other lawsuits, alleging that the historic use of AFFF caused personal injuries and property damage. Additionally, several state and municipal plaintiffs have commenced litigation against the same defendants to recover remediation costs related to historic use of AFFF. In December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ("MDL") transferred and consolidated all of the AFFF cases pending in the federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina for pre-trial proceedings.

Plaintiffs in the MDL allege that a chemical ingredient in AFFF contains, or breaks down into, compounds known as perflourooctane sulfonate ("PFOS") and perflourooctane acid ("PFOA") that were released into the environment and, in some instances, ultimately leached into drinking water supplies. National Foam and Angus Fire purchased these perflourinated 

27

chemical ingredients from third-party chemical manufacturers to manufacture AFFF. Chemicals containing PFOS and PFOA (or their precursors) have also been used for decades by many third parties to manufacture carpets, clothing, fabrics, cookware and other consumer products. The individual plaintiffs in the MDL generally seek compensatory damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, and diminution in property value and injunctive relief to remediate alleged contamination of water supplies. The U.S., state, municipal and water utility plaintiffs in the MDL generally seek damages and costs related to the remediation of public property and water supplies. 

Carrier and other defendants are also party to fewer than 10 cases in state court brought by oil refining companies in the U.S. alleging product liability claims related to legacy sales of AFFF and seeking damages for the costs to replace the product and for property damage. 

Carrier and other defendants are also party to an action related to the AFFF manufacturing facility that was operated by National Foam and Angus Fire in which the water utility plaintiffs seeks remediation costs related to the alleged contamination of the local water supply.

We believe that we have meritorious defenses to these claims. We are also seeking insurance coverage for these claims. At this time, however, given the numerous factual, scientific and legal issues to be resolved relating to these claims, Carrier is unable to assess the probability of liability or reasonably estimate the damages, if any, to be allocated to Carrier, if one or more plaintiffs were to prevail in these cases and there can be no assurance that any such future exposure will not be material in any period.

UTC Equity Awards Conversion Litigation

On August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC and its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut against Raytheon Technologies Corporation, Carrier, Otis, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors (

Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al.

). The complaint challenges the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to UTC, Carrier and Otis equity awards following the Separation and the Distribution. The complaint asserts that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity compensation plans and for breach of fiduciary duty and also asserts claims under certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Carrier believes that the claims against the Company are without merit. 

Other

We have commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the ordinary course of business. We accrue contingencies based on a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, we accrue the minimum amount.

In the ordinary course of business, Carrier is also routinely a defendant in, party to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some of these proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against Carrier and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

A further discussion of our potential regulatory liabilities can be found under the headings "Business" and "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

The Company's common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "CARR." As of December 31, 2020, the approximate number of common stock shareowners of record was 25,967. 

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

The following information is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under the Exchange Act or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into such a filing.

On April 3, 2020, UTC completed the Separation of Carrier into a stand-alone company. As a result of the Separation and the Distribution, Carrier became an independent public company and our common stock commenced trading under the symbol "CARR." The following graph presents the cumulative total shareowner return from the Distribution Date through the year ended December 31, 2020 for our common stock, as compared with the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Our common stock price is a component of the S&P 500 Index. These figures assume that all dividends paid over the period were reinvested and that the starting value of each index and the investment in common stock was $100 on April 3, 2020.

The Company's financial statements for periods prior to the Separation and the Distribution on April 3, 2020 are prepared on a "carve-out" basis. See Note 2 - 

Basis of Presentation

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) 

2020 Operating profit includes a $1.1 billion gain on the sale of our equity ownership in Beijer Ref AB ("Beijer"), (see Note 6 - 

Equity Method Investments and Related Parties

 

in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and a $71 million impairment charge on a minority-owned joint venture investment. 2019 Operating profit includes a $108 million impairment charge related to a minority-owned joint venture investment. 2018 Operating profit includes a $799 million gain on the sale of Taylor Company ("Taylor"). 2017 operating profit includes a $379 million gain on the sale of our investment in Watsco, Inc. 

(3) 

2020 Net income includes a $51 million charge related to a valuation allowance recorded against a United Kingdom tax loss and credit carryforward as a result of the Separation and a $46 million charge resulting from Carrier's decision to no longer permanently reinvest certain pre-2018 unremitted non-U.S. earnings. 2019 Net income includes a net tax benefit of $149 million as a result of the filing by a Carrier subsidiary to participate in an amnesty program offered by the Italian Tax Authority and the conclusion of an audit by the IRS for UTC's 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years. 2018 Net income includes a net tax charge of $102 million as a result of UTC ceasing to assert that it intended to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries. 2017 Net income includes net tax charges of approximately $799 million related to U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017. 

(4)

 Earnings per share for periods presented prior to the Separation and the Distribution were calculated using the number of shares that were distributed to UTC shareowners as a result of the Distribution. For periods prior to the Separation and the Distribution it is assumed that there are no dilutive equity instruments as there were no Carrier stock-based awards outstanding prior to the Separation and the Distribution.

(5) 

Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.

(6) 

The increase in total assets and total liabilities in 2019 primarily relates to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, 

Leases

, which Carrier adopted effective January 1, 2019. 

(7)

 The increase in long-term debt and total liabilities during 2020 reflects the issuance of long-term debt of $11.0 billion associated with the Separation, and the issuance of $750 million 2.700%

 Notes due 2031

, less a $1.75 billion debt prepayment made in the three months ended December 31, 2020. See Note 12 - 

Borrowings and Lines of Credit

 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
