The decrease in revenues for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 reflects the impact of price-downs, run-off, and termination of certain accounts offset by increase in revenue in fiscal 2020 due to contributions from the Luxoft acquisition. Fiscal 2020 revenues included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 

2.2%

, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar, Euro, and British Pound.

During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows:

For a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations, see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.

37

As a global company, over 

63%

 of our fiscal 2020 revenues were earned internationally. As a result, the comparison of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar from period to period is impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency revenues are a non-GAAP measure calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates. This information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends. The table below summarizes our constant currency revenues:

The 

34.0

 point increase in costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2020 primarily reflects our goodwill impairment losses, which were partially offset by the gain on arbitration award and other income.

Costs of Services 

Cost of services, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs ("COS"), was 

$14.9 billion

 for fiscal 2020, including Luxoft, which was flat compared to fiscal 2019. COS as percentage of revenue increased 

3.9

 points, compared to fiscal 2019. This increase was driven by the ongoing investments we are making to secure our customers and higher cost take-out activities in the prior year. 

Selling, General and Administrative  

Selling, general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs ("SG&A"), was 

$2.1 billion

 for fiscal 2020, as compared to 

$2.0 billion

 for fiscal 2019. SG&A increased 

$0.1 billion

, and as a percentage of revenue increased 

1.1

 points, compared to fiscal 2019. The increase includes SG&A related to the Luxoft Acquisition, which we acquired during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Integration, separation and transaction-related costs, included in SG&A, were 

$318 million

 during fiscal 2020, as compared to 

$401 million

 during fiscal 2019.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense ("D&A") was 

$1.9 billion

 for fiscal 2020, compared to 

$2.0 billion

 for fiscal 2019. The decrease in D&A was primarily due to a 

$225 million

 benefit, respectively, from a change in estimated useful lives of certain equipment described in Note 

1

 - "

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

", offset by an increase in depreciation on assets placed into service, as well as increases in software amortization and amortization related to accelerated transition and transformation contract costs.

Goodwill Impairment Losses

DXC recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling 

$6,794 million

 during fiscal 2020. The impairment charges were primarily the result of a sustained decline in market capitalization during the fiscal 2020. See Note 

11

, "

Goodwill

" for additional information.

39

Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization. 

During fiscal 

2020

, management approved global cost savings initiatives designed to reduce operating costs by re-balancing our workforce and facilities structures. The fiscal 2020 global cost savings initiatives were designed to better align our organizational structure with our strategic initiatives and continue the integration of HPES and other acquisitions.

Total restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, during fiscal 

2020

 and 

2019

 were 

$252 million

 and 

$465 million

, respectively. The net amounts recorded included 

$10 million

 and 

$2 million

 of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 

2020

 and 

2019

, respectively, owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations. These augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years. 

See Note 

21

 - "

Restructuring Costs

" for additional information about our restructuring actions. 

Interest Expense and Interest Income

 

Interest expense for fiscal 

2020

 was 

$383 million

 as compared to 

$334 million

 in fiscal 

2019

. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in borrowings and asset financing activities. See the "Capital Resources" caption below and Note 

13

 - “

Debt

” for additional information.

Interest income for fiscal 

2020

 was 

$165 million

, as compared to 

$128 million

 in fiscal 

2019

. The year-over-year increase in interest income includes pre-award interest of $34 million and post-award interest of $2 million related to arbitration discussed below under the caption “Gain on Arbitration Award.”

Gain on Arbitration Award

During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, DXC received final arbitration award proceeds of $666 million related to the HPE Enterprise Services merger completed in fiscal 2018. The arbitration award included $632 million in damages that were recorded as a gain. The remaining $34 million of the award related to pre-award interest. Dispute details are subject to confidentiality obligations.

Other Income, Net 

Other income, net includes non-service cost components of net periodic pension income, movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges, equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, gain on sale of non-operating assets and other miscellaneous gains and losses.

The components of other income, net for fiscal 

2020

 and 

2019

 are as follows:

$476 million

 in non-service components of net periodic pension income and a year-over-year favorable foreign currency impact of 

$56 million

. These increases were offset by a 

$118 million

 decrease in other gains related to sales of non-operating assets.

40

Taxes

Our effective tax rate ("ETR") on income (loss) from continuing operations, before taxes, for fiscal 

2020

 and 

2019

 was 

2.5%

 and 

19.0%

 respectively. A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the ETR, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 

12

 - "

Income Taxes

." 

In fiscal 2020, the ETR was primarily impacted by:

•

Non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, which increased income tax expense and increased the ETR by $1,482 million and 28.3%, respectively.

•

Non-taxable gain on the arbitration award, which decreased income tax expense and decreased the ETR by $186 million and 3.6%, respectively

•

A change in the net valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, primarily in Australia, Brazil, China, Luxembourg, and Singapore, which increased income tax expense and increased the ETR by $631 million and 12.1% respectively.

•

An increase in Income Tax and Foreign Tax Credits, primarily relating to research and development credits recognized for prior years, which decreased income tax expense and decreased the ETR by $135 million and 2.6%, respectively.

•

Local losses on investments in Luxembourg that increased the foreign rate differential and decreased the ETR by $637 million and 12.2%, respectively, with an offsetting increase in the ETR due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount.

In fiscal 2019, the ETR was primarily impacted by:

•

Local tax losses on investments in Luxembourg that decreased the foreign tax rate differential and decreased the ETR by $

360 million

 and 

23.7%

, respectively, with an offsetting increase in the ETR due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount.

•

A change in the net valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, primarily in Luxembourg, Germany, Spain, UK, and Switzerland, which increased income tax expense and increased the ETR by 

$256 million

 and 

16.9%

, respectively.

•

A decrease in the transition tax liability and a change in tax accounting method for deferred revenue, which decreased income tax expense and decreased the ETR by $

66 million

 and 

4.3%

, respectively.

In fiscal 2018, the ETR was primarily impacted by: 

•

Due to the Company's change in repatriation policy, the reversal of a deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference of foreign subsidiaries which increased the income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by 

$554 million

 and 

42.5%

, respectively.

•

The accrual of the one-time transition tax on estimated unremitted foreign earnings, which decreased the income tax benefit and increased the ETR by 

$361 million

 and 

27.7%

, respectively.

•

The remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which increased the income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by 

$338 million

 and 

25.9%

, respectively.

The IRS is examining CSC's federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through 2017. With respect to CSC's fiscal 2008 through 2010 federal tax returns, we previously entered into negotiations for a resolution through settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals. The IRS examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments. We have an agreement in principle with the IRS Office of Appeals as to some but not all of these adjustments. We have agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with this audit through September 30, 2020. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we filed for competent authority relief relating to certain legacy CSC foreign restructuring expenses deducted for the U. S. federal tax return for tax year March 31, 2013. The Company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 through December 31, 2020. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company received a Revenue Agent's Report with proposed adjustments to CSC's fiscal 2014 through 2017 federal returns. The Company has filed a protest for certain of these adjustments with the IRS Office of Appeals. The Company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations for the fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016 through December 31, 2020 and for the employment tax audit of fiscal years 2015 and 2016 until January 31, 2021. The Company expects to reach a resolution for all years no earlier than the first quarter of fiscal 2022 except agreed issues related to fiscal 2008 through 2010 and fiscal 2011 through 2013 federal tax returns, which are expected to be resolved within twelve months. 

41

In addition, we may settle certain other tax examinations, have lapses in statutes of limitations, or voluntarily settle income tax positions in negotiated settlements for different amounts than we have accrued as uncertain tax positions. We may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts for tax positions that previously met a more likely than not standard if such positions are not upheld. Conversely, we could settle positions by payment with the tax authorities for amounts lower than those that have been accrued or extinguish a position through payment. We believe the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next twelve months may result in a reduction in liability for uncertain tax positions of $25 million to $27 million, excluding interest, penalties, and tax carryforwards.

Income from Discontinued Operations

The $35 million of income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year 2019 reflects the net income generated by USPS during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Earnings Per Share 

Diluted EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 

2020

 was 

$20.76

, a decrease of 

$25.11

 per share compared with the prior fiscal year. The EPS decrease was due to a decrease of 

$6,585 million

 in income from continuing operations.

Diluted EPS for fiscal 

2020

 includes 

$0.80

 per share of restructuring costs, 

$0.98

 per share of transaction, separation and integration-related costs, 

$1.73

 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets, 

$25.78

 per share of goodwill impairment losses, 

$(2.43)

 per share of arbitration award gains, 

$(0.74)

 per share of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains, and 

$0.13

 per share of tax adjustment relating to prior restructuring charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We present non-GAAP financial measures of performance which are derived from the statements of operations of DXC. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, constant currency revenues, net debt and net debt-to-total capitalization.

We present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information, in addition to the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items from GAAP results which DXC management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. DXC management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the financial performance of DXC exclusive of the impacts of corporate-wide strategic decisions. DXC management believes that adjusting for these items provides investors with additional measures to evaluate the financial performance of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period. DXC management believes the non-GAAP measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering DXC, as equity research analysts continue to publish estimates and research notes based on our non-GAAP commentary, including our guidance around non-GAAP EPS targets.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items from GAAP results which DXC management believes are not indicative of operating performance such as the amortization of acquired intangible assets and transaction, separation and integration-related costs.

Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations may result in a significant difference in period over period amortization expense on a GAAP basis. We exclude amortization of certain acquired intangibles assets as these non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Although DXC management excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily customer related intangible assets, from its non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and support revenue generation. Any future transactions may result in a change to the acquired intangible asset balances and associated amortization expense.

42

There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies.

 

Non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP include:

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our non-GAAP adjustments include:

•

Restructuring - reflects costs, net of reversals, related to workforce optimization and real estate charges.

•

Transaction, separation and integration-related costs - reflects costs related to integration planning, financing and advisory fees associated with the HPES Merger and other acquisitions and costs related to the separation of USPS and costs to execute on strategic alternatives.

•

Amortization of acquired intangible assets - reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

•

Goodwill impairment losses - reflects impairment losses on goodwill.

•

Gain on arbitration award - reflects a gain related to the HPES merger arbitration award.

•

Pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses - reflects pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses.

•

Tax adjustment - Fiscal 2020 includes the impact of an adjustment to the Transition Tax and tax liabilities related to prior restructuring charges. Fiscal 2019 reflects the estimated non-recurring benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Fiscal 2018 reflects the application of an approximate 28% tax rate, which is within the targeted effective tax rate range for fiscal year 2018. Income tax expense of other non-GAAP adjustments is computed by applying the jurisdictional tax rate to the pre-tax adjustments on a jurisdictional basis.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows

As of 

March 31, 2020

, our cash and cash equivalents ("cash") were 

$3.7 billion

, of which 

$1.2 billion

 was held outside of the United States. A substantial portion of funds can be returned to the U.S. from funds advanced previously to finance our foreign acquisition initiatives. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and after the mandatory one-time income inclusion (deemed repatriation) of the historically untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and current income inclusions for global intangible low taxed income, we expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax consequences upon subsequent repatriation to the U.S. However, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax consequences upon future remittance. Therefore, if additional funds held outside the U.S. are needed for our operations in the U.S. we plan to repatriate these funds.

Cash was 

$3.7 billion

 and 

$2.9 billion

 as of 

March 31, 2020

 and 

March 31, 2019

, respectively. The following table summarizes our cash flow activity:

Operating cash flow

 

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was 

$2,350 million

 as compared to 

$1,783 million

 during fiscal 2019. The increase of 

$567 million

 was due to an increase in net income, net of adjustments of 

$458 million

, which includes an increase in working capital movements of 

$109 million

. Net income, net of adjustments includes cash received on arbitration award of $668 million.

Investing cash flow

 

Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities during fiscal 2020 was 

$(2,137) million

 as compared to 

$69 million

 during fiscal 2019. The increase of 

$2,206 million

 was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 

$1,632 million

, a decrease in cash collections related to deferred purchase price receivable of 

$413 million

, a decrease in proceeds from sale of assets of 

$284 million

, and net short-term investing of 

$37 million

. The increase is partially offset by a decrease in payments for transition and transformation costs of 

$113 million

 and cash paid for business dispositions of 

$65 million

 in fiscal 2019.

Financing cash flow

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities during fiscal 2020 was 

$657 million

, as compared to 

$(1,663) million

 during fiscal 2019. The 

$2,320 million

 increase was primarily due to borrowings under lines of credit in fiscal 2020 of 

$1.5 billion

, additional borrowings on long-term debt of 

$552 million

, a decrease in payments on long-term debt of 

$1,586 million

, and lower repurchases of common stock and advance payment for accelerated share repurchase of 

$608 million

. This was partially offset by an increase in repayments of commercial paper of 

$44 million

, borrowings for the USPS spin transaction of 

$1,114 million

 in fiscal 2019, and proceeds from bond issuance of 

$753 million

 in fiscal 2019.

The 

$2.5 billion

 increase in total debt during fiscal 2020 was primarily attributed to the 

$1.5 billion

 borrowing from the credit facility agreement and the new term loan credit agreement in an aggregate principal of 

$2.2 billion

, consisting of three tranches: (i) 

$500 million

 maturing on fiscal 2025; (ii) 

€750 million

 maturing on fiscal 2022; and (iii) 

€750 million

 maturing on fiscal 2023. The proceeds from the new term loan credit agreement was used to finance the Luxoft Acquisition. Additionally, we repaid the 

$500 million

 Senior Notes due 2020 and

Net debt and Net debt-to-total capitalization are non-GAAP measures used by management to assess our ability to service our debts using only our cash and cash equivalents. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing our capital structure in a more comprehensive way compared to gross debt based ratios alone.

Net debt-to-total capitalization as of 

March 31, 2020

 increased as compared to 

March 31, 2019

, primarily due to the increase in total debt attributed to the Luxoft Acquisition, borrowing from the credit facility agreement, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents used to pay down Senior Notes, and the decrease in equity resulting from goodwill impairment charges reported during fiscal 2020.

See Note 

22

 - "

Commitments and Contingencies

" for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments. The anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below.

Liquidity

We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity; however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, term loans, and bonds. In addition, we currently utilize, and will further utilize, our cross currency cash pool for liquidity needs. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing, if required, on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, in the future.

Our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance.

During 

March 2020

 as the evolving global COVID-19 pandemic crisis resulted in increasing government actions to shut down economic activity and enforce stay-at-home orders, global capital markets were disrupted and became tumultuous, including the near shut down of commercial paper markets for issuers such as the Company as short-term fixed income investors prepared for potential redemptions. On 

March 24, 2020

, the Company announced the draw-down of 

$1.5 billion

 from its Revolving Credit Facility due 

2025

 in order to increase cash on hand and eliminate the reliance on commercial paper markets along with the suspension of the Company’s Euro and USD commercial paper program until the Company deems such capital markets stabilized and reliable. As a result, the Company’s commercial paper outstanding was reduced to 

$542 million

 as of 

March 31, 2020

, and another 

$318 million

 is scheduled to mature during the quarter ending 

June 30, 2020

, which the Company currently expects to fund such maturing Euro commercial paper from its cash on hand. While central bank actions have improved liquidity in commercial paper markets overall, there is no assurance that the Company, at its commercial program ratings of P2/F2, will have reliable access in the future or if accessible, at reasonable costs.

On 

April 6, 2020

 subsequent to the fiscal period end, the Company drew the entire 

$2.5 billion

 remaining availability under its Revolving Credit Facilities, in order to secure liquidity as additional cash on hand to support the Company’s liquidity resources during the COVID pandemic crisis and to mitigate the uncertainties caused by volatile capital markets, changing governmental policies, and evolving impact on world economies.

Subsequent to the end of the fiscal period, the Company issued 

$1.0 billion

 in principal amount of Senior Notes in the form of 

$500 million

 principal amount of 

4.0%

 Senior Notes due 

2023

 and 

$500 million

 principal amount of 

4.125%

 Senior Notes due 

2025

. All the net proceeds from the Notes offerings were applied towards the early prepayment of the Company’s term loan facilities, including prepayment of 

€500 million

 of Euro Term Loan due fiscal 

2022

, 

£150 million

 of GBP Term Loan due fiscal 

2022

, 

A$300 million

 of AUD Term Loan due fiscal 

2022

, and 

$100 million

 of USD Term Loan due fiscal 

2025

.

On 

May 15, 2020

, the Company agreed with its lenders and modified the definition of Leverage Ratio to be measured on a “net of cash” basis across all of the Company’s bank credit and term loan facilities, and for such newly defined Leverage Ratio limitation of Total Consolidated Net Indebtedness to Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, as defined in such credit and term loan facilities, currently at 3.0x, to be reduced to 2.25x thereafter beginning the fiscal year ending 

March 31, 2022

 (with the first quarterly measurement date as of 

June 30, 2021

). The net effect of such adjustment to the Leverage Ratio definition in the Company’s credit and term loan facilities is to allow the Company the flexibility to maintain elevated cash balances going forward both during current circumstances and thereafter, without constraining the Company’s strategy of maintaining strong access to liquidity during the COVID pandemic crisis. The Company’s credit and term loan facilities that were modified include: 

$4.0 billion

 Revolving Credit Facilities due fiscal year 

2025

 (including a 

$70 million

 sub-tranche due fiscal 

2024

), 

€250 million

 Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 

2022

 (a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 

2023

 pursuant to the Euro Term Loan Extension, see below), 

€750 million

 Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 

2023

 (a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 

2024

 pursuant to the Euro Term Loan Extension, see below), 

£300 million

 in GBP Term Loan due fiscal year 

2022

, 

A$500 million

 in AUD Term Loan due fiscal year 

2022

, and approximately 

$382 million

 in outstanding USD Term Loan due fiscal year 

2025

.

49

On 

May 15, 2020

, the Company initiated elective extension amendments in accordance with the terms of the aggregate 

€1.0 billion

 principal amount of Euro Term Loans outstanding. Accordingly, 

€216.7 million

 out of 

€250 million

 Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 

2022

 agreed to extend maturity 12-months to mature fiscal year 

2023

, and 

€700 million

 out of total 

€750 million

 Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 

2023

 agreed to extend maturity 12-months to mature fiscal year 

2024

. Margin would increase during the 12-month extension terms to Euribor + 125bps and Euribor + 175bps respectively, for the Euro Term Loans originally due fiscal years 

2022

 and 

2023

, which would be an increase from the current applicable margin of Euribor + 65bps, and Euribor + 80 bps, respectively. There is no change to current margin or terms through the original maturity term of the Euro Term Loans.

The debt maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of long-term debt principal taking into effect borrowings and prepayments as mentioned above, for fiscal years subsequent to May 15, 2020, and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under long-term financing and capitalized lease liabilities.

Share Repurchases

During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 

$2.0 billion

 of our common stock and during fiscal 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an incremental 

$2.0 billion

 share repurchase authorization. An expiration date has not been established for this repurchase plan. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 

15,933,651

 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 

$736 million

. See Note 

15

 - "

Stockholders' Equity

" for more information.

Dividends

During fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of 

$0.84

 per share, or approximately 

$219 million

. To enhance our financial flexibility under current uncertain market conditions, we have elected to suspend payment of a quarterly dividend. This decision will be reevaluated by the Board of DXC Technology as market conditions stabilize.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees, the receivables securitization facility and certain other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. We also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets. See Note

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in accordance with GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. We consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them: revenue recognition, income taxes, business combinations, defined benefit plans and valuation of assets. We have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.

51

Revenue Recognition

Most of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time. However, some arrangements may require significant estimates, including contracts which include multiple performance obligations

.

Contracts with Multiple performance obligations

Many of our contracts require us to provide a range of services or performance obligations to our customers, which may include a combination of services, products or both. As a result, significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the elements specified in contracts with multiple performance obligations should be treated as separate performance obligations for revenue recognition purposes, and, when considered appropriate, how the total transaction price should be allocated among the performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition for each. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Other than software sales involving multiple performance obligations, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. Certain of our contracts involve the sale of DXC proprietary software, post contract customer support and other software-related services. The standalone selling price generally is determined for each performance obligation using an adjusted market assessment approach based on the price charged where each deliverable is sold separately. In certain limited cases (typically for software licenses) when the historical selling price is highly variable, the residual approach is used. This approach allocates revenue to the performance obligation equal to the difference between the total transaction price and the observable standalone selling prices for the other performance obligations. These methods involve significant judgments and estimates that we assess periodically by considering market and entity-specific factors, such as type of customer, features of the products or services and market conditions.

Once the total revenues have been allocated to the various performance obligations, revenues for each are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for each. Estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception.

Costs to obtain contracts with customers

Accounting for the costs to obtain contracts with customers requires significant judgments and estimates with regards to the determination of sales commission payments that qualify for deferral of costs and the related amortization period. Most of our sales commission plans are quota-based and payments are made by achieving targets related to a large number of new and renewed contracts. Certain sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. We defer and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over an average period of benefit of five years, which is determined and regularly assessed by considering the length of our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Significant changes in these estimates or impairment may result if material contracts terminate earlier than the expected benefit period, or if there are material changes in the average contract period.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, analyzing our income tax reserves, the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and any corresponding adjustment of valuation allowances. In addition, our tax returns are routinely audited, and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.  

As a global enterprise, our ETR is affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, the extent to which our non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, changes in tax regulations, acquisitions, dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income. We cannot predict what our ETR will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors. 

52

The majority of unremitted earnings has been taxed in the U.S. through the transition tax and global intangible low tax income tax in connection with 2017 U.S. tax reform. The Company was not permanently reinvested in all jurisdictions with the exception of India as of March 31, 2019. As a result of the issuance of new U.S. Treasury regulations in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company changed its permanent reinvestment assertion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with respect to certain foreign corporations, reducing the amount that will ultimately be repatriated to the U.S. by approximately $492 million. However, as of March 31, 2020, the Company anticipates that future earnings in India will not be indefinitely reinvested. This change resulted from the Company's determination that it is now efficient to repatriate earnings in India as a result of the enactment of India Finance Act, 2020 on March 27, 2020 and change in cash needs resulting from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon repatriation to the U.S., however, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and U.S. state tax consequences when remitted.

Considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. In determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately $

2.2 billion

 as of March 31, 2020 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets. However, valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors. 

Recent enactment of the CARES Act or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex changing tax regulations. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the CARES Act. The CARES Act makes a technical correction to the 2017 U.S. tax reform to provide a 15-year recovery period for qualified improvement property ("QIP"). This correction makes QIP eligible for bonus depreciation and is effective as if enacted as part of the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Accordingly, the Company has applied bonus depreciation on certain QIP. CARES also includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, the ability to utilize and carryback certain net operating losses, alternative minimum tax refunds, and modifications to rules regarding the deductibility of net interest expense. 

Business Combinations

We account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, if any. Liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results, could result in material impacts to our financial results. Adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in 

changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.

Defined Benefit Plans

 

The computation of our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. Inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates. Our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary. The fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. 

Our weighted average rates used were:

The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan; judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses. The discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period.

Valuation of Assets

We review long-lived ("assets, intangible assets, and goodwill") for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in Note 

1

 - 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

. Assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows. The valuation of long-lived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets, particularly purchased intangible assets. These estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts.

Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities, and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The identification of reporting units involves consideration of components of the operating segments and whether or not there is discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by management. Additionally, we consider whether or not it is reasonable to aggregate any of the identified components that have similar economic characteristics. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

53

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using performance-metric market multiples. The discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with business-specific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected future cash flows.
