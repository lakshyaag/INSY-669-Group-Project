ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

OVERVIEW

Company

Qorvo

®

 is a leader in the development and commercialization of technologies and products for wireless and wired connectivity.  We combine a broad portfolio of innovative RF solutions, highly differentiated semiconductor technologies, systems-level expertise and global manufacturing scale to supply a diverse set of customers a broad range of products that enable a more connected world.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, our customer demand, supply chain and global operations were modestly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.  However, the potential duration and future impact of the outbreak on the global economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty; the outbreak has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment, and economic uncertainty, which may adversely affect our business, and may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers, and our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.  

We remain committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees in all locations, and we are working to ensure our compliance with government-imposed restrictions while also maintaining business continuity.  Qorvo has implemented multiple protocols in its facilities worldwide, including increased cleaning and sanitation procedures, pre-shift temperature screenings, and enhanced use of personal protective equipment.  In addition, Qorvo has taken steps to effectively implement social distancing, including rotating shifts and remote-work options whenever possible.

Business Segments

We design, develop, manufacture and market our products to U.S. and international OEMs and ODMs in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: Mobile Products ("MP") and Infrastructure and Defense Products ("IDP").

MP is a global supplier of cellular, UWB and Wi-Fi solutions for a variety of high-volume markets, including smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and IoT applications. 

IDP is a global supplier of RF, SoC and power management solutions for wireless infrastructure, defense, smart home, automotive and other IoT applications. 

These business segments are based on the organizational structure and information reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and are managed separately based on the end markets and applications they support.  The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of each reportable segment primarily based on non-GAAP operating income.  For financial information about the results of our reportable operating segments for each of the last three fiscal years, see Note 

17

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Fiscal 

2020

 Management Summary

•

Revenue 

increased

 

4.8%

 in fiscal 

2020

 to 

$3,239.1 million

, compared to 

$3,090.3 million

 in fiscal 

2019

, 

primarily due to higher demand for our mobile products in support of customers based in China, a Korea-based customer and our largest end customer, partially offset by lower demand for our base station products as a result of trade restrictions

Gross margin for fiscal 

2020

 was 

40.8%

, compared to 

38.7%

.  This 

increase

 was 

primarily due to favorable changes in product mix, lower intangible amortization expense and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by average selling price erosion and lower factory utilization

.

•

Operating income was 

$423.2 million

 in fiscal 

2020

, compared to 

$216.5 million

 in fiscal 

2019

$945.6 million

 for fiscal 

2020

, compared to

Revenue

Revenue 

increased

 

primarily due to higher demand for our mobile products in support of customers based in China, a Korea-based customer and our largest end customer, partially offset by lower demand for our base station products as a result of trade restrictions

. 

We provided our products to our largest end customer (Apple) through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for 

33%

 and 

32%

 of total revenue in fiscal years 

2020

 and 

2019

, respectively.  Huawei accounted for approximately 

10%

 and 

15%

 of total revenue in fiscal years 

2020

 and 

2019

, respectively.  These customers primarily purchase RF solutions for a variety of mobile devices.  

    

Our sales to Huawei have been and will continue to be impacted by trade restrictions (see Note 

2

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report). 

International shipments amounted to 

$1,770.8 million

 in fiscal 

2020

 (approximately 

55%

 of revenue) compared to 

$1,710.8 million

 in fiscal 

2019

 (approximately 

55%

 of revenue).  Shipments to Asia totaled 

$1,616.4 million

 in fiscal 

2020

 (approximately 

50%

 of revenue) compared to 

$1,554.6 million

 in fiscal 

2019

 (approximately

Operating Expenses

 

Research and Development

 

R&D spending 

increased

 primarily due to higher personnel related costs. 

Selling, General and Administrative

 

Selling, general and administrative expense 

decreased

 primarily due to lower intangible amortization expense.

Other Operating Expense 

In fiscal 

2020

, we recognized 

$50.9 million

 of expense related to the acquisitions of Active-Semi, Cavendish, Custom MMIC and Decawave (see Note 

5

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information on business acquisitions).  In fiscal 

2020

, we also recorded restructuring related charges of 

$13.4 million

 related to employee termination benefits and other exit costs as a result of restructuring actions (see Note 

12

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information on restructuring actions). 

In fiscal 

2019

, we recognized 

$15.9 million

 of asset impairment charges (to adjust the carrying value of certain property and equipment to reflect fair value) and 

$13.5 million

 of restructuring related charges (primarily employee termination benefits) as a result of restructuring actions (see Note 

12

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information on restructuring actions).  In fiscal 2019, we also recorded 

$18.0 million

 

of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in existing facilities.

decreased

 primarily due to higher operating expenses, lower gross margin and lower revenue.  The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs and the addition of Active-Semi expenses.  Gross margin was negatively impacted by lower factory utilization, inventory charges and average selling price erosion.

Table of Contents

Other income (expense)

 

During fiscal 

2020

 we recorded a gain of 

$43.0 million

 related to the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Cavendish in connection with our purchase of the remaining issued and outstanding capital of the entity (see Note 

5

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 for additional information regarding the Cavendish acquisition).  During fiscal 

2020

 we recorded an impairment of 

$18.3 million

 on an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value (see Note 

7

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 for additional information regarding our investments).

During fiscal 

2019

 we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of 

$90.2 million

 (see Note 

9

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt extinguishment activity).

Income tax (expense) benefit

Income tax 

expense

 for fiscal 

2020

 was 

$60.8 million

.  This was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations generating pre-tax book income, the impact of the Tax Act's GILTI provisions, the reversal of the permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to certain unrepatriated foreign earnings, and an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits, offset by a tax benefit related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book losses and domestic tax credits.  For fiscal 

2020

, this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 

15.4%

. 

Income tax benefit for fiscal 

2019

 was 

$41.3 million

.  This was primarily comprised of tax benefits related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book losses, tax credits, adjustments related to provisional estimates for the impact of the Tax Act, and a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits, offset by tax expenses related to international operations generating pre-tax book income and tax expense related to the GILTI inclusions.  For fiscal 

2019

, this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of 

(45.0)%

.

A valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where, based upon the positive and negative evidence available, it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers, credit carryovers, depreciable tax basis, and other deferred tax assets exist.  Management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.  As of the end of fiscal years 

2020

 and 

2019

, the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was 

$35.3 million

 and 

$40.4 million

, respectively. 

See Note 

13

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding income taxes.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

Under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718, 

"Compensation – Stock Compensation,"

 stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options (Black-Scholes) and market price for restricted stock units, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.  

As of 

March 28, 2020

, total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units was 

$87.4 million

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of approximately 

1.3 years

.

Table of Contents

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity.  As of 

March 28, 2020

, we had working capital of approximately 

$1,151.5 million

, including 

$714.9 million

 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to working capital of 

$1,249.2 million

, including 

$711.0 million

 in cash and cash equivalents, as of 

March 30, 2019

.  

Our 

$714.9 million

 of total cash and cash equivalents as of 

March 28, 2020

, includes approximately 

$345.3 million

 held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which 

$266.4 million

 is held by Qorvo International Pte. Ltd. in Singapore.  If the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the U.S., we may be required to pay state income and/or foreign local withholding taxes to repatriate these earnings.

At this time, we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flow.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and availability under our revolving credit facility.  However, as the situation evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs, evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions.

Credit Agreement

On December 5, 2017, we and certain of our material domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") entered into the Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent").  The Credit Agreement included the Term Loan and a 

$300.0 million

 senior revolving line of credit (the "Revolving Facility").  In addition, we may request one or more additional tranches of term loans or increases in the Revolving Facility, up to an aggregate of 

$300.0 million

 and subject to securing additional funding commitments from the existing or new lenders (the "Incremental Facility", and collectively with the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility, the "Credit Facility").  On the closing date, 

$100.0 million

 of the Term Loan was funded (and was subsequently repaid in March 2018).  On June 17, 2019, we drew 

$100.0 million

 of the Term Loan.  The delayed draw availability period for the remaining 

$200.0 million

 of the Term Loan expired on December 31, 2019.  The Revolving Facility includes a 

$25.0 million

 sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 

$10.0 million

 sublimit for swing line loans.  The Credit Facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.  Outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of December 5, 2022 (with amounts borrowed under the swingline option due in full no later than ten business days after such loan is made), subject to scheduled amortization of the Term Loan principal as set forth in the Credit Agreement prior to the maturity date.  During fiscal 

2020

, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility.

See Note 

9

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information about the Credit Agreement, including applicable interest rates and financial covenants.  As of 

March 28, 2020

, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.

Stock Repurchases

 

On October 31, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to 

$1.0 billion

 of our outstanding common stock, which included approximately 

$117.0 million

 authorized under the prior program which was terminated concurrent with the new authorization.  Under this program, share repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The extent to which we repurchase our shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases depends on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations.  The program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares, does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. 

We repurchased 

6.4 million

 shares, 

9.1 million

 shares and 

2.9 million

 shares of our common stock during fiscal years 

2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

, respectively, at an aggregate cost of 

$515.1 million

, 

$638.1 million

 and 

$219.9 million

, respectively, in accordance with the current and prior share repurchase programs.  As of 

March 28, 2020

, 

$765.9 million

 remains available for future repurchases under our current share repurchase program.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

 

Operating activities in fiscal 

2020

 provided cash of 

$945.6 million

, compared to 

$810.4 million

 in fiscal 

2019

.  This year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital driven by improvements in days sales outstanding and improved inventory management in fiscal 

2020

.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 

2020

 was 

$1,105.7 million

, compared to 

$247.6 million

 in fiscal 

2019

.  This year-over-year increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Active-Semi, Cavendish, Custom MMIC and Decawave in fiscal 

2020

.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 

2020

 was 

$165.6 million

, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 

$776.7 million

 in fiscal 

2019

.  In fiscal 2019, cash disbursed in connection with the retirement of all of the 2023 Notes and a majority of the 2025 Notes was partially offset by cash proceeds received from the issuance of the 2026 Notes.  During fiscal 2020, we received cash proceeds of 

$559.0 million

 from the issuance of the 2029 Notes and 

$100.0 million

 from the draw on the Term Loan.

Our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of and demand for our products, acquisition opportunities, technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers.  Based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations, coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our Credit Facility, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our short-term and long-term cash requirements.  However, if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products, or if our revenue grows faster than we anticipate, operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs.  If existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable, we may seek additional debt or equity financing.  Additional equity or debt financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock.  Further, we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing, if required, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

We do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years 

2020

 and 

2019

.  However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.  

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As of 

March 28, 2020

, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

(1) Capital commitments represent obligations for the purchase of property and equipment, a majority of which are not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of 

March 28, 2020

.

(2) Long-term debt obligations represent future cash payments of principal and interest over the life of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the Term Loan, including anticipated interest payments not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 

March 28, 2020

.  Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, and any future redemptions would impact our cash payments.  See Note 

9

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. 

(3) The finance lease obligation primarily relates to a lease that was signed in fiscal 2018 for an assembly and test facility in Beijing, China.  This lease will allow us to consolidate several leased facilities in Beijing, China.  The lease is not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 

March 28, 2020

 because the lease term is not expected to commence until fiscal 2021.

(4) Purchase obligations represent payments due related to the purchase of materials and manufacturing services, a majority of which are not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates.  The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management.  Our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective (see Note 

1

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report). 

Inventory Reserves.  

The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory.  The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally 12 to 24 months.  The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions.  Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, market conditions, and customer acceptance of our products and technologies, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost.

Historically, inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted.  Inventory reserves had an impact on margins of 

less than 2%

 in fiscal years 

2020

 and 

2019

.

Property and Equipment.  

Periodically, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property and equipment, considering factors such as changes in machinery and equipment technology, our ability to re-use equipment across generations of process technology and historical usage trends.  When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the revised useful lives of the assets.

We assess property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable.  Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include an adverse change in our use of the assets or an expectation that the assets will be sold or otherwise disposed.  We assess the recoverability of the assets held and used by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts.  Assets identified as "held for sale" are recorded at the lesser of their carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell.  Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.  The process of evaluating property and equipment for impairment is highly subjective and requires significant judgment as we are required to make assumptions about items such as future demand for our products and industry trends.

Business Acquisitions. 

 We record goodwill when the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired.  Goodwill is assigned to our reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.  

A number of assumptions, estimates and judgments are used in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly with respect to the intangible assets acquired.  The valuation of intangible assets requires our use of valuation techniques such as the income approach.  The income approach includes management’s estimation of future cash flows (including expected revenue growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.

Further judgment is required in estimating the fair values of deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date, as well as inventory, property and equipment, pre-existing liabilities or legal claims, deferred revenue and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable.

While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.  As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Goodwill.  

We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.  Reporting units, as defined by ASC 350, "

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,"

 may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component.  We have determined that our reporting units are our two operating and reportable segments, MP and IDP.

In accordance with ASC 350, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. 

In performing a qualitative assessment, we consider (i) our overall historical and projected future operating results, (ii) if there was a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period, (iii) if there was a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value, and (iv) if there was a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy of the semiconductor industry, as well as other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit.  If we assess these qualitative factors and conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we decide not to perform a qualitative assessment, then a quantitative impairment test is performed.

Table of Contents

In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we completed qualitative assessments and concluded that based on the relevant facts and circumstances, it was more likely than not that each reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its related carrying value and no further impairment testing was required. 

In fiscal 2020, we performed a quantitative impairment test.  Our quantitative impairment test considered both the income approach and the market approach to estimate each reporting unit’s fair value.  Under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Cash flow projections are based on our estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions.  The discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows.  The market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics.  The resulting fair value, based on the income and market approaches, is then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary.  

As a result of the quantitative analysis performed in fiscal 2020, it was determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.  As the assumptions used in the income approach and market approach can have a material impact on the fair value determinations, we performed a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions used in the assessment and determined that a one percentage point increase in the discount rate along with a one percentage point decrease in the long-term growth rate would not result in an impairment of goodwill for either reporting unit and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.

Identified Intangible Assets.  

We amortize finite-lived intangible assets (including developed technology, customer relationships, trade names, technology licenses and backlog) over their estimated useful life.  In-process research and development ("IPRD") assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition; initially, these are classified as IPRD and are not subject to amortization.  Upon completion of development, IPRD assets are transferred to developed technology and are amortized over their useful lives.  The asset balances relating to abandoned projects are impaired and expensed to R&D.  We perform a quarterly review of significant intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances (including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts) indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts.  Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amounts over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made.

Revenue Recognition.

 We generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, or at completion of a consignment process.  Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  A majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on individual customer terms and conditions.  Revenue from sales to our distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in).  Revenue is recognized from our consignment programs at a point in time when the products are pulled from consignment inventory by the customer.  Revenue recognized for products and services over-time is immaterial (less than 

2%

 of overall revenue).  We apply a five-step approach as defined in ASC 606, "

Revenue from Contracts with Customers," 

in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied. 

Sales agreements are in place with certain customers and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply, but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments.  In the absence of a sales agreement, our standard terms and conditions apply.  We consider a customer's 

44

Table of Contents

purchase order, which is governed by a sales agreement or our standard terms and conditions, to be the contract with the customer.

Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis.  In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to a refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled.  Variable consideration in the form of rebate programs is offered to certain customers, including distributors.  A majority of these rebates are accrued and classified as a contra accounts receivable and represent less than 

5%

 of net revenue.  We determine variable consideration by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer.  Our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products.  However, we may authorize sales returns under certain circumstances, which include courtesy returns and like-kind exchanges.  Sales returns are classified as a refund liability.  We reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances, rebate programs and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement.

Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers.  Payments are due upon completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing.  Substantially all payments are collected within our standard terms, which do not include any financing components.  To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.  Contract assets and contract liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were immaterial as of 

March 28, 2020

 and 

March 30, 2019

.

We invoice customers upon shipment and recognize revenues in accordance with delivery terms.  As of 

March 28, 2020

, we had 

$37.8 million

 in remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year, of which the majority is expected to be recognized as income over the next 12 months.

We include shipping charges billed to customers in "Revenue" and include the related shipping costs in "Cost of goods sold" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including tariffs, value-added and excise taxes, are excluded from revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers.  Sales commissions (which are recorded in the "Selling, general and administrative" expense line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations) are expensed when incurred because such commissions are not owed until the performance obligation is satisfied, which coincides with the end of the contract term, and therefore no remaining period exists over which to amortize the commissions. 

Income Taxes.

 

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense, the resultant tax liabilities, and the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

As part of our financial process, we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered.  If recovery is not more likely than not (a likelihood of less than 50 percent), the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable.  In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including: the amount of income or loss in prior years, the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, future expected taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  Changes in taxable income, market conditions, U.S. or international tax laws, and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets.  These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made.  See Note 

13

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets.

As part of our financial process, we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained.  To the extent it is determined it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained, a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability.  Our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.  These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made.  See Note 

13

 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.
