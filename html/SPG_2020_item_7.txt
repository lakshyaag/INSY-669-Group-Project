>Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. In this discussion, unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Simon" mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the "Operating Partnership" mean Simon Property Group, L.P.  References to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon.

We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets

®

, and The Mills

®

. As of December 31, 2020, we owned or held an interest in 203 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 99 malls, 69 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills, four lifestyle centers, and 17 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 80% noncontrolling interest in The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. In addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at several properties in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2020, we had ownership in 31 Premium Outlets and Designer Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe, and Canada. We also have four international outlet properties under development. As of December 31, 2020, we also owned a 22.4% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 15 countries in Europe.

We generate the majority of our lease income from retail, dining, entertainment, and other tenants including consideration received from:

●

fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (CAM) reimbursements, and

●

variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants’ sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, utilities, marketing and certain other items.

Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.

We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following:

●

attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,

●

expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,

●

selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,

●

generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and

●

selling selective non-core assets.

We also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:

●

establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,

Table of Contents

●

offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,

●

selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as “outlots” or “outparcels,” and

●

generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities

.

We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties.

We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.

To support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:

●

provide the capital necessary to fund growth,

●

maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and

●

manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.

We consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and portfolio NOI to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.

COVID-19

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a significant negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world in 2020, and, notwithstanding the fact that vaccines have started to be administered in the United States and elsewhere, the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in real estate. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities, including where we own or hold interests in properties, have imposed measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-at-home, shelter-in-place orders, capacity limitations and social distancing measures. Governments and other authorities are in varying stages of lifting or modifying some of these measures, however certain governments and other authorities have already been forced to, and others may in the future, reinstate these measures or impose new, more restrictive measures, if the risks, or the tenants’ and consumers’ perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic worsen at any time. Although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, with tenants adding services like curbside pickup, and while consumer risk-tolerance is evolving, such adaptations and evolution may take time, and there is no guarantee that retail will return to pre-pandemic levels even once the pandemic subsides. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and these measures, the Company may experience material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in our assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by our properties.  Due to certain restrictive governmental orders placed on us, our domestic portfolio lost approximately 13,500 shopping days during the year.

As of October 7, 2020, all of our domestic properties and certain of our retailer investments had reopened, but we do not have certainty that additional closures in the future will not be required. 

As we developed and implemented our response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restriction intended to prevent its spread on our business, our primary focus has been on the health and safety of our employees, our shoppers and the communities in which we serve.  We implemented a series of actions to reduce costs and increase liquidity in light of the economic impacts of the pandemic, including:

●

significantly reduced all non-essential corporate spending, 

●

significantly reduced property operating expenses, including discretionary marketing spend, 

59




Table of Contents

●

implemented a temporary furlough of certain corporate and field employees due to the closure of the Company’s U.S. properties as a result of restrictive governmental orders; reduced certain corporate and field personnel and implemented a temporary freeze on company hiring efforts, and

●

suspended more than $1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects.  

  

 

Results Overview

Diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased $3.22 during 2020 to $3.59 as compared to $6.81 in 2019. The decrease in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to:

●

a lawsuit settled with our former insurance broker in 2019 related to the significant flood damage sustained at Opry Mills in May 2010 of $68.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share/unit,

●

a gain in 2019 related to the disposition of our interest in a multi-family residential investment of $16.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share/unit,

●

decreased consolidated lease income of $941.4 million, or $2.65 per diluted share/unit, comprised of decreased fixed lease income of $422.0 million and decreased variable lease income of $519.4 million, which was primarily due to COVID-19 disruption,

●

decreased other income, excluding the two aforementioned 2019 transactions, of $106.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share/unit, primarily related to decreased Simon Brand Ventures and gift card revenues due to COVID-19 disruption,

●

a net loss in 2020 of $115.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share/unit, primarily related to impairment charges in 2020 related to Klépierre, our investment in HBS, one consolidated property, and three joint venture properties, partially offset by gains from disposition activity in 2020, of $14.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share/unit which was lower than 2019 net gains,

●

decreased income from unconsolidated entities of $224.5 million, or $0.63 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to unfavorable domestic and international operations and year-over-year operations from retailer investments of $7.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share/unit, all of which were impacted by COVID-19 disruption, and

●

an unrealized unfavorable change in fair value of equity instruments of $11.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by 

●

decreased consolidated total operating expenses of $211.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share/unit, which was primarily related to cost reduction efforts as a result of the COVID-19 disruption,

●

a charge on early extinguishment of debt of $116.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share/unit, in 2019, and

●

decreased tax expense of $34.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share/unit.  

Portfolio NOI decreased 17.1% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Average base minimum rent for U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 2.2% to $55.80 psf as of December 31, 2020, from $54.59 psf as of December 31, 2019. Leasing spreads in our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets decreased to an open/close leasing spread (based on total tenant payments — base minimum rent plus common area maintenance) of $4.41 psf ($60.08 openings compared to $64.49 closings) as of December 31, 2020, representing a 6.8% decrease. Ending occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets decreased 3.8% to 91.3% as of December 31, 2020, from 95.1% as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to 2020 tenant bankruptcy activity, partially offset by leasing activity.

Our effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2020 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 18 basis points to 2.98% as compared to 3.16% at December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 130 basis points (1.31% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 2.61% at December 31, 2019) partially offset by an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of four basis points (3.50% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 3.46% at December 31, 2019).  The weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 7.3 years and 7.4 years at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot.

  Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.

Total Reported Sales per Square Foot.

  Given the impact of COVID-19 and the governmental restrictions placed on us, we are not presenting reported retail sales per square foot as we do not believe the trends for the period are indicative of future operating trends.

Current Leasing Activities

During 2020, we signed 460 new leases and 1,175 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 6.1 million square feet, of which 4.8 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During 2019, we signed 990 new leases and 1,281 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 7.6 million square feet, of which 5.7 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $53.97 per square foot in 2020 and $56.80 per square foot in 2019 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $51.01 per square foot and $47.57 per square foot, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

●

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. Our assessment of collectability incorporates available operational performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as other publicly available information with respect to our tenant’s financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, including declines in such conditions due to, or amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic.  When a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances including, among other things, the timing of a tenant’s bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumption by the tenant in bankruptcy proceeding of leases at the Company’s properties on substantially similar terms.  In the event that we determine accrued receivables are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on a cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and straight-line rent receivable charged as a direct write-off against lease income in the period of the change in our collectability determination.  

●

We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, changes in a property’s operational performance such as declining cash flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset, and, if applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing arrangements. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization during the anticipated holding period plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over our estimate of its fair value. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investments are less than their carrying value and such impairment is other-than-temporary. Our evaluation of changes in economic or operating conditions and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary may include developing estimates of fair value, forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization. We estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data such as operating income, hold periods, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information and whether certain impairments are other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.

●

To maintain Simon’s status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact Simon’s REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain Simon’s REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period Simon did not qualify as a REIT. If Simon lost its REIT status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless its failure was due 

63




Table of Contents

to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.

●

In the period of a significant acquisition of real estate, we make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of asset acquisitions (including the components of excess investment in joint ventures) to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our real estate valuations are typically the determination of relative fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants’ ability to pay rents based upon the tenants’ operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.

In the following discussions of our results of operations, “comparable” refers to properties we owned and operated in both years in the year to year comparisons.

Year Ended December 31, 2020 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2019

Lease income decreased $941.4 million, of which the property transactions accounted for $3.9 million of the decrease.  Comparable lease income decreased $937.5 million, or 17.9%. Total lease income decreased primarily due to decreases in fixed minimum lease and CAM consideration recorded on a straight-line basis of $422.0 million and reduced variable lease income of $519.4 million, primarily related to lower consideration based on tenant sales and negative variable lease income due to abatements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Total other income decreased $190.2 million, primarily due to a $75.7 million decrease related to Simon Brand Venture and gift card revenues, a $68.0 million decrease related to a gain on settlement with our former insurance broker in 2019, a $16.2 million gain on the 2019 sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property, a $10.9 million decrease in distributions from investments, a $9.1 million decrease in interest income and lower business interruption insurance proceeds received in connection with our two Puerto Rico properties as a result of hurricane damages of $5.2 million, partially offset by a $6.2 million gain on a partial sale and mark-to-market adjustment of our retained interest in a non-retail investment and a $4.1 million gain related to the sale of outparcels.

Property operating expenses decreased $104.0 million primarily due to the closure of properties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.

Repairs and maintenance expenses decreased $19.6 million primarily due to the closure of properties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.

Advertising and promotion decreased $51.7 million primarily due to the closure of properties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.

General and administrative expense decreased $12.3 million due to lower executive compensation.

Other expense increased $27.8 million primarily related to an increase in legal fees and expenses.

During 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $116.3 million as a result of the early redemption of senior unsecured notes.

Income and other tax expense changed by $34.7 million primarily as a result of a higher tax benefit due to larger losses on our share of operating results in the retail operations venture of SPARC Group as compared to 2019, and reduced withholding and income taxes related to certain of our international investments, partially offset by tax expense from a bargain purchase gain recorded as a result of the acquisition of our interest in Forever 21.

Income from unconsolidated entities decreased $224.5 million primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year domestic and international property operations, as well as results of operations from our retailer investments, both of which were impacted by COVID-19 disruption, partially offset by a $35.0 million pre-tax non-cash bargain purchase gain recorded as a result of the acquisition of our interest in Forever 21 and a gain from the sale of a non-retail asset, of which our share

was $17.8 million. 

During 2020, we recorded $125.6 million of impairment charges related to one consolidated property, an other-than-temporary impairment on our equity investment in three joint venture properties, an other-than-temporary impairment to reduce our investment in HBS to its estimated fair value, and a $4.3 million loss, net, related to the impairment and disposition of certain assets by Klépierre, partially offset by a $12.3 million gain on the disposal of our interest in one consolidated property, a $1.9 million excess gain on insurance proceeds related to our two properties in Puerto Rico and a $1.0 million gain related to the disposition of a shopping center by one of our joint venture investments. During 2019, we recorded net gains of $62.1 million primarily related to Klépierre’s disposition of certain shopping centers, offset by a $47.2 million impairment charge related to our investment in HBS.  

Simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $156.8 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership.  

Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2018

Lease income increased $85.4 million during 2019, of which the property transactions accounted for $33.2 million of the increase.  Comparable lease income increased $52.2 million, or 1.0%, due to increases in fixed minimum lease and CAM consideration recorded on a straight-line basis, as a result of the adoption of ASC 842.  

Total other income increased $27.9 million, primarily due to a $68.0 million increase related to a lawsuit settled with our former insurance broker in 2019 related to the significant flood damage sustained at Opry Mills in May 2010, a $16.2 million gain on the sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property, a $12.4 million increase in interest income, an $11.2 million increase in Simon Brand Venture and gift card revenues, an increase of $10.4 million in land sales including gains as a result of land contributions for densification projects at two of our properties, and the impact of consolidated franchise and hotel revenues, partially offset by a $35.6 million non-cash gain recorded in 2018 associated with our contribution of our interest in the Aéropostale licensing venture for additional interests in ABG, a $26.7 million decrease in lease settlement income, a $23.9 million decrease in income related to distributions from an international investment received in 2018 and a $9.5 million decrease related to business interruption insurance proceeds received in connection with our two Puerto Rico properties as a result of hurricane damages.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $58.0 million, of which the property transactions accounted for $11.0 million.  The comparable properties increased $47.0 million primarily as a result of an increase in tenant allowance write-offs in 2019 and the acceleration of depreciation on a property upon initiation of a major redevelopment.

Home and regional office costs increased $53.4 million, primarily due to the suspension of leasing cost capitalization in 2019 as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement.

General and administrative expense decreased $11.7 million due to lower executive compensation.

Other expense increased $15.8 million primarily related to a $4.9 million unfavorable non-cash mark-to-market on certain of our non-real estate equity instruments, and the impact of consolidated franchise and hotel operational expenses.

During 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $116.3 million as a result of the early redemption of senior unsecured notes.

Income from unconsolidated entities decreased $30.9 million as a result of the sale of German assets within our HBS joint venture in 2018, and the impact from the consolidation of a property that was previously unconsolidated in the third quarter of 2018, partially offset by favorable results of operations from our international joint venture investments.

During 2019, we recorded net gains of $62.1 million primarily related to Klépierre’s disposition of certain shopping centers, offset by a $47.2 million impairment charge related to our investment in HBS.  During 2018, we recorded net gains of $12.5 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets and $276.3 million primarily related to our disposition of two retail properties, as well as the disposal of our interest in the German department stores owned through our investment in HBS, as further discussed in Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $60.7 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised only 12.1% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2020. We also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $2.6 billion in the aggregate during 2020. The Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.

Our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $342.2 million during 2020 to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 as further discussed below.

On December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $6.7 billion under the Facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of $2.1 billion, amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper program of $623.0 million and letters of credit of $12.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Facilities was $3.9 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $1.8 billion. The weighted average interest rate was 1.04% for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had access to private and public, short and long-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.

Our business model and Simon’s status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facility and the Supplemental Facility, or together the Credit Facilities, and the Commercial Paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2021.

Cash Flows

Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $2.6 billion during 2020. In addition, we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities of $2.3 billion in 2020. These activities are further discussed below under “Financing and Debt.” During 2020, we also:

●

funded the acquisition of the ventures which purchased certain assets of Forever 21, acquired additional interests in SPARC Group and ABG, funded the acquisition of the ventures which purchased certain assets of J.C. Penney, and funded the acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in TRG, the aggregate cash portion of which was $3.6 billion,

●

issued 22,137,500 shares of common stock in a public offering for $1.6 billion, net of issue costs,

●

paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling approximately $1.7 billion and preferred unit distributions totaling $5.3 million,

●

funded consolidated capital expenditures of $484.1 million (including development and other costs of $26.3 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $399.3 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $58.5 million),

●

funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $191.4 million,

●

funded investments in equity instruments of $33.0 million,

●

received proceeds on the sale of equity instruments of $30.0 million,

●

received insurance proceeds from third-party carriers for property restoration related to hurricane damages of $31.2 million,

In general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders and/or distributions to partners necessary to

Table of Contents

maintain Simon’s REIT qualification on a long-term basis.  At this time, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to impact our ability to fund these needs for the foreseeable future; however its ultimate impact is difficult to predict. In addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from the following, however a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, may affect our ability to access necessary capital:

●

excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,

●

borrowings on the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program,

●

additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or

●

additional equity raised in the public or private markets.

We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2021, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations, including one due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended to restrict its spread, could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program, further curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing.

Financing and Debt

Unsecured Debt

At December 31, 2020, our unsecured debt consisted of $17.1 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership, $125.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, $2.0 billion outstanding under the Term Facility, and $623.0 million outstanding under Commercial Paper program.  

On March 16, 2020, the Operating Partnership replaced in its entirety its existing $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit facility comprised of (i) an amendment and extension of the Credit Facility and (ii) the Term Facility. The Credit Facility and the Term Facility can be increased in the form of either additional commitments under the Credit Facility or incremental term loans under the Term Facility in an aggregate amount for all such increases not to exceed $1.0 billion, for a total aggregate size of $7.0 billion, in each case, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.  Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to 95% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Term Facility and Credit Facility are June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Each of the Term Facility and Credit Facility can be extended for two additional six-month periods to June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2025, respectively, at our sole option, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent. The Term Facility was available via a single draw during the nine-month period following March 16, 2020, which the Operating Partnership drew on December 15, 2020.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Operating Partnership’s election, at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 0.65% and 1.40% or (ii) the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or LIBOR plus 1.00%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 0.00% and 0.40%. The Credit Facility includes a facility fee determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 0.10% and 0.30% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a money market competitive bid option program that allows the Operating Partnership to hold auctions to achieve lower pricing for short-term borrowings. Borrowings under the Term Facility bear interest, at the Operating Partnership’s election, at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin determined based on the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 0.725% and 1.60% or (ii) the base rate (equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus a margin determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 0.00% and 0.60%.  The Term Facility includes a ticking fee equal to 0.10% of the unused term loan commitment under the Term Facility, which ticking fee commenced accruing on the date that is forty-five days after the closing of the Term Facility.

The Supplemental Facility’s initial borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion may be increased to $4.5 billion during its term and provides for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. The initial maturity date of the Supplemental Facility was extended to June 30, 2022 and can be extended for an additional year 

68




Table of Contents

to June 30, 2023 at our sole option, subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof. The base interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points, with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points. 

On December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $6.7 billion under the Facilities. The maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Facilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.9 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $1.8 billion. Letters of credit of $12.3 million were outstanding under the Facilities as of December 31, 2020.

The Operating Partnership also has available a Commercial Paper program of $2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof. The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  Notes will be sold under customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the Operating Partnership's other unsecured senior indebtedness.  The Commercial Paper program is supported by the Credit Facilities and if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under either of the Credit Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program. On December 31, 2020, we had $623.0 million outstanding under the Commercial Paper program, fully comprised of U.S. dollar denominated notes with a weighted average interest rate of 0.29%.  These borrowings have a weighted average maturity date of February 19, 2021 and reduce amounts otherwise available under the Credit Facilities.

On July 9, 2020, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: $500.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 3.50%, $750 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.65%, and $750 million with a fixed interest rate of 3.80%, with maturity dates of September 2025 (the “2025” Notes”), June 2030, and June 2050, respectively. The 2025 Notes were issued as additional notes under an indenture pursuant to which the Operating Partnership previously issued $600 million principal amount of 3.50% senior notes due September 2025 on August 17, 2015. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering funded the optional redemption at par of senior unsecured notes in July and August 2020, as discussed below, and repaid a portion of the indebtedness under the Facilities.

On July 10, 2020 the Operating Partnership repaid $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and $750.0 million under the Supplemental Facility.

On July 22, 2020, the Operating Partnership completed the optional redemption at par of its $500 million 2.50% notes due September 1, 2020. 

On August 6, 2020 the Operating Partnership completed the optional redemption at par of its €375 million 2.375% notes due October 2, 2020.

On January 21, 2021 the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: $800 million with a fixed interest rate of 1.75%, and $700 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.20%, with maturity dates of January 2028 and 2031, respectively.

On January 27, 2021 the Operating Partnership completed the planned optional redemption of its $550 million 2.50% notes due on July 15, 2021, including the make-whole amount. Further, on February 2, 2021, the Operating Partnership repaid $750 million under the Term Facility.

On October 7, 2019 the Operating Partnership completed the early redemption of its $900 million 4.375% notes due March 1, 2021, $700 million 4.125% notes due December 1, 2021, $600 million 3.375% notes due March 15, 2022 and €375 million of the €750 million 2.375% notes due October 2, 2020. We recorded a $116.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the early redemption.

Mortgage Debt

Total consolidated mortgage indebtedness, which is typically secured by the underlying assets and non-recourse to the Operating Partnership, was $7.0 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Covenants

Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. If we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender, including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.

69




Table of Contents

At December 31, 2020, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 46 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 49 properties and other assets, including two separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At December 31, 2020, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured non-recourse debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. As of December 31, 2020, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture-related mortgage 

70




Table of Contents

indebtedness of $219.2 million. Mortgages guaranteed by the Operating Partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.

Hurricane Impacts

As discussed further in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, during the third quarter of 2017, two of our wholly-owned properties located in Puerto Rico sustained significant property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Maria.  

Since the date of the loss, we have received $81.1 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers related to the two properties located in Puerto Rico, of which $47.5 million was used for property restoration and remediation and to reduce the insurance recovery receivable.  During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $5.2 million and $10.5 million, respectively, as business interruption income, which was recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  

During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Texas experienced property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Hanna.  We wrote-off assets of approximately $9.6 million, and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $14.3 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery receivable.

During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Louisiana experienced property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Laura.   We wrote-off assets of approximately $11.1 million and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $20.6 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery receivable.  

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner’s interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.

Acquisitions.  

In January 2020, we acquired additional interests of 5.05% and 1.37% in SPARC Group and ABG, respectively, for $6.7 million and $33.5 million, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, SPARC acquired certain assets and operations of Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brands out of bankruptcy. At September 30, 2020, our noncontrolling equity method interests in the operations venture of SPARC Group and in ABG were 50.0% and 6.8%, respectively.

On September 19, 2019, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in a hotel adjacent to one of our properties from our joint venture partner for cash consideration of $12.8 million. As of closing, the property was subject to a $21.5 million, 4.02% variable rate mortgage. 

On September 25, 2018, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in The Outlets at Orange from our joint venture partner.  The Operating Partnership issued 475,183 units, or approximately $84.1 million, as consideration for the acquisition.  The property is subject to a $215.0 million 4.22% fixed rate mortgage loan. 

Dispositions.

  We may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area.

During 2020, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. A portion of the gross proceeds on this transaction of $33.4 million was used to partially repay a cross-collateralized mortgage. Our share of the $12.3 million gain is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. 

During 2019, we disposed of our interests in one multi-family residential investment. Our share of the gross proceeds on this transaction was $17.9 million. Our share of the gain of $16.2 million is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. We also recorded net gains of $62.1 million, primarily

related to Klépierre’s disposition of its interests in certain shopping centers, of which our share was $58.6 million, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

During 2018, we recorded net gains of $288.8 million primarily related to disposition activity which included the foreclosure of two consolidated retail properties in satisfaction of their $200.0 million and $80.0 million non-recourse mortgage loans and, as discussed in Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, our interest in the German department store properties owned through our investment in HBS was sold during the fourth quarter of 2018. Also, as discussed further in Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, Klépierre disposed of its interests in certain shopping centers resulting in a gain of which our share was $20.2 million.

Joint Venture Formation Activity

On December 29, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in TRG, which has an ownership interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Under the terms of the transaction, we, through the Operating Partnership, acquired all of Taubman Centers, Inc. common stock for $43.00 per share in cash. Total consideration for the acquisition, including the redemption of Taubman’s $192.5 million 6.5% Series J Cumulative Preferred Shares and its $170.0 million 6.25% Series K Cumulative Preferred Shares, and the issuance of 955,705 Operating Partnership units, was approximately $3.5 billion.  Our investment includes the 6.38% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for $362.5 million issued to us.

On December 7, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of J.C. Penney, a department store retailer, out of bankruptcy. Our noncontrolling interest in the venture is 41.67% and was acquired for cash consideration of $125.0 million.

On February 19, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of Forever 21, a retailer of apparel and accessories, out of bankruptcy. The interests were acquired through two separate joint ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture. Our noncontrolling interest in each of the retail operations venture and in the licensing venture is 37.5%. Our aggregate investment in the ventures was $67.6 million. In connection with the acquisition of our interest, the Forever 21 joint venture recorded a non-cash bargain purchase gain of which our share of $35.0 million pre-tax is included in income from unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

On October 16, 2019, we contributed approximately $276.8 million consisting of cash and the Shop Premium Outlets, or SPO, assets for a 45% noncontrolling interest in Rue Gilt Groupe, or RGG, to create a new multi-platform venture dedicated to digital value shopping, as further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.    

Development Activity

We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants are underway at several properties in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has suspended more than $1.0 billion of capital in development projects.  The Company will re-evaluate all suspended projects over time.  Construction continues on certain redevelopment and new development projects in the U.S. and internationally that are nearing completion.  Our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately $829 million.  Simon’s share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is approximately $89 million.  We expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. We seek a stabilized return on invested capital in the range of 8-10% for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects.

International Development Activity

  

We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. Our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Peso, Won, and other foreign currencies is not material. We expect our share of estimated committed capital for international development projects to be completed with projected delivery in 2021 or 2022 is $36 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.

The following table describes recently completed and new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):

Dividends, Distributions and Stock Repurchase Program

Simon paid a common stock dividend of $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $4.70 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts. In 2019, Simon paid dividends of $2.10 and $8.30 per share for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts. On December 15, 2020, Simon’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $1.30 per share, payable on January 22, 2021 to shareholders of record on December 24, 2020.  The distribution rate on units is equal to the dividend rate on common stock. In order to maintain its status as a REIT, Simon must pay a minimum amount of dividends. Simon’s future dividends and the Operating Partnership’s future distributions will be determined by Simon’s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, based on actual and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, financing covenants, if any, and the amount required to maintain Simon’s status as a REIT.

On February 13, 2017, Simon’s Board of Directors authorized a two-year extension of the previously authorized $2.0 billion common stock repurchase plan through March 31, 2019.  On February 11, 2019, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan.  Under the plan, Simon could repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period ending February 11, 2021 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, Simon purchased 1,245,654 shares at an average price of $122.50 per share.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, Simon purchased 2,247,074 shares at an average price of $160.11 per share, of which 46,377 shares at an average price of $164.49 were purchased as part of the previous program.  At December 31, 2020, we had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of common stock, which has subsequently expired.  As Simon repurchases shares under these programs, the Operating Partnership repurchases an equal number of units from Simon.  

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may be deemed "forward–looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward–looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by 

74




Table of Contents

these forward–looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: uncertainties regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders; changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely affect the general retail environment; the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants; the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry, including e-commerce; an increase in vacant space at our properties; the inability to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties on favorable terms; our international activities subjecting us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations, including changes in foreign exchange rates; risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment, expansion, leasing and management of properties; general risks related to real estate investments, including the illiquidity of real estate investments; the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations, including covenants in the governing agreements that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate freely; any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements; any change in our credit rating; changes in market rates of interest; the transition of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate; our continued ability to maintain our status as a REIT; changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences; risks relating to our joint venture properties, including guarantees of certain joint venture indebtedness; environmental liabilities; natural disasters; the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage; the potential for terrorist activities;  security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure; and the loss of key management personnel; and. We discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports, but except as required by law, we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as FFO, diluted FFO per share, NOI, and portfolio NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.

We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement.  Our main business includes acquiring, owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate.  Gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in FFO.  We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP:

●

excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization,

●

excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items,

●

excluding gains and losses from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, depreciable retail operating properties,

●

plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and

●

all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.

You should understand that our computations of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP measures:

●

do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,

●

should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and

●

are not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Item 

7A.  Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes.

77




Table of Contents

We may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes. Upon completion of the debt issuance, the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.

Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, primarily LIBOR. Based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at December 31, 2020, a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $16.3 million, and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $747.2 million.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Simon Property Group, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Simon Property Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Simon Property Group, Inc.:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Simon Property Group, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

Evaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment

​

Description of the Matter

​

At December 31, 2020, the Company’s consolidated net investment properties totaled $23.2 billion. In addition, a significant number of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated entities and its investment in Klépierre hold investment properties. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of an investment property may not be recoverable. The Company estimates undiscounted cash flows of an investment property using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated capitalization rates, leasing prospects and local market information. 

​

Auditing management’s evaluation of investment properties for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the undiscounted cash flows of an investment property. In particular, the impairment evaluation for investment properties was sensitive to significant assumptions such as forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capitalization rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market

or economic conditions, demand, and competition.

​

​

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

​

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process for evaluating investment properties for impairment, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above.  

​

To test the Company’s evaluation of investment properties for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, relevant market information, and other applicable sources. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating certain assumptions. In addition, we compared the forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation and amortization to historical actual results and evaluated significant variances, including consideration of the current economic environment. As part of our evaluation, we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted cash flows of the related investment property that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Evaluation of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for Impairment

Description of the Matter

​

At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated entities and its investment in Klépierre totaled $4.3 billion. As explained in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated entity may not be recoverable. To identify and evaluate whether an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value has occurred, the Company assesses economic and operating conditions that may affect the fair value of the investment. The evaluation of operating conditions may include developing estimates of forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization to support the recoverability of the carrying amount of the investment. When required, the Company estimates the fair value of an investment and assesses whether any impairment is other-than-temporary using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows or operating income, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. 

​

Auditing management’s evaluation of investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated fair value of each investment and whether any decline in fair value below the related investment’s carrying amount is other-than-temporary. In particular, the impairment evaluation for these investments was sensitive to significant assumptions such as forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, relevant market multiples, and capitalization and discount rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition.

​

Evaluation of Collectability of Tenant Receivables and Accrued Revenue

​

Description of the Matter

​

At December 31, 2020, the Company’s tenant receivables and accrued revenue totaled $1.2 billion. As discussed in Notes 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accrues fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease when the Company believes substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line receivable, is probable of collection. The Company’s assessment of collectability incorporates available tenant operational and liquidity information and includes expectations and estimates made by the Company with respect to each lease. 

​

Auditing management’s evaluation of collectability of tenant receivables and accrued revenue was challenging due to the significant judgment that was necessary when assessing whether it is probable that the tenant will pay outstanding receivables and whether it is probable that substantially all future lease payments will be collected in accordance with the lease terms. In particular, the assessment of collectability incorporates information regarding a tenant’s financial condition that is obtained from available financial data, the expected outcome of contractual disputes and management’s communications and negotiations with the tenant.

​

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

​

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process for evaluating collectability of tenant receivables and accrued revenues, including controls over management’s review of the information and judgments described above. 

​

To test the Company’s evaluation of collectability of tenant receivables and accrued revenue, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied and evaluating the information used by management in its analysis. As part of our assessment, we reviewed executed lease agreements and amendments, evaluated publicly available information on the tenant’s financial condition and operational performance and considered recent collections activity. Further, we evaluated the status of contractual disputes with certain tenants, including review of the related lease agreements, considered recent resolutions of similar matters and obtained representations from internal legal counsel. We also evaluated the impact of activity subsequent to the balance sheet date on the Company’s estimates.

Basis for Opinion

The Partnership’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

Evaluation of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for Impairment

Description of the Matter

At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Partnership’s investments in unconsolidated entities and its investment in Klépierre totaled $4.3 billion. As explained in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership reviews investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated entity may not be recoverable. To identify and evaluate whether an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value has occurred, the Partnership assesses economic and operating conditions that may affect the fair value of the investment. The evaluation of operating conditions may include developing estimates of forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization to support the recoverability of the carrying amount of the investment. When required, the Partnership estimates the fair value of an investment and assesses whether any impairment is other than temporary using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows or operating income, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. 

​

Auditing management’s evaluation of investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated fair value of each investment and whether any decline in fair value below the related investment’s carrying amount is other-than-temporary. In particular, the impairment evaluation for these investments was sensitive to significant assumptions such as forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, relevant market multiples, and capitalization and discount rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition.

Evaluation of Collectability of Tenant Receivables and Accrued Revenue

​

Description of the Matter

​

At December 31, 2020, the Partnership’s tenant receivables and accrued revenue totaled $1.2 billion. As discussed in Notes 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership accrues fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease when the Partnership believes substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line receivable, is probable of collection. The Partnership’s assessment of collectability incorporates available tenant operational and liquidity information and includes expectations and estimates made by the Partnership with respect to each lease. 

​

Auditing management’s evaluation of collectability of tenant receivables and accrued revenue was challenging due to the significant judgment that was necessary when assessing whether it is probable that the tenant will pay outstanding receivables and whether it is probable that substantially all future lease payments will be collected in accordance with the lease terms. In particular, the assessment of collectability incorporates information regarding a tenant’s financial condition that is obtained from available financial data, the expected outcome of contractual disputes and management’s communications and negotiations with the tenant.

​

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

​

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Partnership’s process for evaluating collectability of tenant receivables and accrued revenues, including controls over management’s review of the information and judgments described above. 

​

To test the Partnership’s evaluation of collectability of tenant receivables and accrued revenue, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied and evaluating the information used by management in its analysis. As part of our assessment, we reviewed executed lease agreements and amendments, evaluated publicly available information on the tenant’s financial condition and operational performance and considered recent collections activity. Further, we evaluated the status of contractual disputes with certain tenants, including review of the related lease agreements, considered recent resolutions of similar matters and obtained representations from internal legal counsel. We also evaluated the impact of activity subsequent to the balance sheet date on the Partnership’s estimates.

1. Organization

Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Simon" mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the "Operating Partnership" mean Simon Property Group, L.P.  References to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated, these notes to consolidated financial statements apply to both Simon and the Operating Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon.

We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, and The Mills®.  As of December 31, 2020, we owned or held an interest in 

203

 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 

99

 malls, 

69

 Premium Outlets, 

14

 Mills, 

four

 lifestyle centers, and 

17

 other retail properties in 

37

 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 

80

% noncontrolling interest in the Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 

24

 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2020, we had ownership interests in 

31

 Premium Outlets and Designer Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe, and Canada. As of December 31, 2020, we also owned a 

22.4

% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 

15

 countries in Europe.

We generate the majority of our lease income from retail, dining, entertainment and other tenants including consideration received from:

●

Fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (CAM) reimbursements and,

●

Variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants’ sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, utilities, marketing, and certain other items.

Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.

We also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:

●

establishing our properties as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,

●

offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,

●

selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as “outlots” or “outparcels,” and

●

generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.

2. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

We consolidate properties that are wholly-owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control. Control of a property is demonstrated by, among other factors, our ability to refinance debt and sell the property without the consent of any other partner or owner and the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.

We also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements. There have been no changes during 2020 in previous conclusions about whether an entity qualifies as a VIE or whether we are the primary beneficiary of any previously identified VIE. During the periods presented, we did not provide financial or other support to any identified VIE that we were not contractually obligated to provide.

Investments in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests. We account for these unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. We initially record these investments at cost and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of the applicable partnership or joint venture agreement, cash contributions and distributions, and foreign currency fluctuations, if applicable. The allocation provisions in the partnership or joint venture agreements are not always consistent with the legal ownership interests held by each general or limited partner or joint venture investee primarily due to partner preferences. We separately report investments in partnerships and joint ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income of the partnerships and joint ventures within cash distributions and losses in partnerships and joint ventures, at equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The net equity of certain partnerships and joint ventures is less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that are usually greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.

As of December 31, 2020, we consolidated 

133

 wholly-owned properties and 

17

 additional properties that are less than wholly-owned, but which we control or for which we are the primary beneficiary. We account for the remaining 

84

 properties, or the joint venture properties, as well as our investments in Klépierre, HBS Global Properties, or HBS, and TRG, and our retailer investments in Authentic Brands Group LLC, or ABG, Forever 21, J.C. Penney, Rue Gilt Groupe, or RGG, and SPARC Group, formerly known as Aéropostale, using the equity method of accounting, as we have determined we have significant influence over their operations. We manage the day-to-day operations of 

57

 of the 

84

 joint venture properties, but have determined that our partner or partners have substantive participating rights with respect to the assets and operations of these joint venture properties. Our investments in joint ventures in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Germany, Canada, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom comprise 

23

 of the remaining 

27

 properties. These international properties and TRG are managed by joint ventures in which we share control.

Preferred distributions of the Operating Partnership are accrued at declaration and represent distributions on outstanding preferred units of partnership interests, or preferred units, and are included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  We allocate net operating results of the Operating Partnership after preferred distributions to limited partners and to us based on the partners’ respective weighted average ownership interests in the Operating Partnership. Net operating results of the Operating Partnership attributable to limited partners are reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

We record investment properties at cost. Investment properties include costs of acquisitions; development, predevelopment, and construction (including allocable salaries and related benefits); tenant allowances and improvements; and interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction. We capitalize improvements and replacements from repair and maintenance when the repair and maintenance extends the useful life, increases capacity, or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance items are expensed as incurred. We capitalize interest on projects during periods of construction until the projects are ready for their intended purpose based on interest rates in place during the construction period. The amount of interest capitalized during each year is as follows:

We record depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over an estimated original useful life, which is generally 

10

 to 

35 years

. We review depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and we make adjustments when necessary to reflect a shorter economic life. We amortize tenant allowances and tenant improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. We record depreciation on equipment and fixtures utilizing the straight-line method over 

seven

 to 

ten years

.

We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These

circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in a property’s operational performance, such as declining cash flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset, and, if applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing arrangements. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization during the anticipated holding period plus its residual value, and, if applicable, on a probability weighted basis, is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over our estimate of fair value. 

We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value and such impairment is other-than-temporary. Our evaluation of changes in economic or operating conditions and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary may include developing estimates of fair value, forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization. 

We estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data such as operating income before depreciation and amortization, hold periods, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information, expected probabilities of outcomes, if applicable, and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions including, changes in the financial condition of our tenants and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.  

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $

34.4

 million related to 

one

 consolidated property, which is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.  During the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $

55.2

 million, representing our equity method investment balance in 

three

 joint venture properties, which is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.  

Purchase Accounting

We allocate the purchase price of asset acquisitions and any excess investment in unconsolidated entities to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component which may be derived from various observable or unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, we may utilize third party valuation specialists. These components typically include buildings, land and intangibles related to in-place leases and we estimate:

●

the relative 

fair value of land and related improvements and buildings on an as-if-vacant basis,

●

the market value of in-place leases based upon our best estimate of current market rents and amortize the resulting market rent adjustment into lease income,

●

the value of costs to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances and improvements and leasing commissions, and

●

the value

 of lease income and recovery of costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the space was vacant.

The relative fair value of buildings is depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. We amortize tenant improvements, in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles over the remaining life of the underlying leases. We also estimate the value of other acquired intangible assets, if any, which are amortized over the remaining life of the underlying related intangibles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents generally consist of commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, Eurodollars, repurchase agreements, and money market deposits or securities. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include our cash and cash equivalents and our trade accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with institutions of high credit quality. However, at certain times, such cash and cash equivalents are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits. See Notes 4 and 8 for disclosures about non-cash investing and financing transactions.

Equity Instruments and Debt Securities

Equity instruments and debt securities consist primarily of equity instruments, our deferred compensation plan investments, the debt securities of our captive insurance subsidiary, and certain investments held to fund the debt service requirements of debt previously secured by investment properties. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had equity instruments with readily determinable fair values of $

41.9

 million and $

68.2

 million, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these equity instruments are recorded in earnings. Non-cash mark-to-market adjustments related to an investment we hold in units of a publicly traded real estate investment trust are included in unrealized losses in fair value of equity instruments in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Non-cash mark-to-market adjustments related to other non-real estate securities with readily determinable fair values for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were 

nil

, $

5.0

 million, and 

nil

, respectively, and these losses were recorded in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had equity instruments without readily determinable fair values of $

309.3

 million and $

295.4

 million, respectively, for which we have elected the measurement alternative. We regularly evaluate these investments for any impairment in their estimated fair value, as well as any observable price changes for an identical or similar equity instrument of the same issuer, and determined that no material adjustment in the carrying value was required for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Our deferred compensation plan equity instruments are valued based upon quoted market prices.  The investments have a matching liability as the amounts are fully payable to the employees that earned the compensation.  Changes in value of these securities and changes to the matching liability to employees are both recognized in earnings and, as a result, there is no impact to consolidated net income.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held debt securities of $

40.5

 million and $

52.8

 million, respectively, in our captive insurance subsidiary. The types of securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive insurance subsidiary are typically U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government securities as well as corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from less than 

one year

 to 

ten years

. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are valued based upon quoted market prices or other observable inputs when quoted market prices are not available. The amortized cost of debt securities, which approximates fair value, held by our captive insurance subsidiary is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Changes in the values of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the gain or loss is realized or until any unrealized loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We review any declines in value of these securities for other-than-temporary impairment and consider the severity and duration of any decline in value. To the extent an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred, an impairment is recorded and a new cost basis is established.

Our captive insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus as well as maintain a minimum liquidity ratio. Therefore, our access to these securities may be limited. 

Fair Value Measurements

Level 1 fair value inputs are quoted prices for identical items in active, liquid and visible markets such as stock exchanges. Level 2 fair value inputs are observable information for similar items in active or inactive markets, and 

101




Table of Contents

Simon Property Group, Inc.

Simon Property Group, L.P.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations. Level 3 fair value inputs reflect our best estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation estimate. We have 

no

 investments for which fair value is measured on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.

The equity instruments with readily determinable fair values we held at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were primarily classified as having Level 1 and Level 2 fair value inputs. In addition, we had derivative instruments which were classified as having Level 2 inputs, which consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements with an insignificant gross asset balance at December 31, 2020 and $

17.5

 million at December 31, 2019, and a gross liability balance of $

44.6

 million and $

3.8

 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Note 7 includes a discussion of the fair value of debt measured using Level 2 inputs.  Notes 3 and 4 include discussions of the fair values recorded in purchase accounting using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs.  Level 3 inputs to our purchase accounting and impairment analyses include our estimations of fair value, net operating results of the property, capitalization rates and discount rates. 

Gains or losses on 

Issuances

 of Stock by Equity Method Investees 

When one of our equity method investees issues additional shares to third parties, our percentage ownership interest in the investee may decrease. In the event the issuance price per share is higher or lower than our average carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance, when appropriate. This noncash gain or loss is recognized in our net income in the period the change of ownership interest occurs.

Use of Estimates

We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.

Segment and Geographic Locations

Our primary business is the ownership, development, and management of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed use real estate. We have aggregated our retail operations, including malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, and our international investments into 

one

 reportable segment because they have similar economic characteristics and we provide similar products and services to similar types of, and in many cases, the same, tenants.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately 

6.9

% of our consolidated long-lived assets and 

2.4

% of our consolidated total revenues were derived from assets located outside the United States.  As of December 31, 2019, approximately 

6.2

% of our consolidated long-lived assets and 

2.9

% of our consolidated total revenues were derived from assets located outside the United States.

Deferred Lease Costs

Our deferred leasing costs consist primarily of initial direct costs and, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, capitalized salaries and related benefits, in connection with lease originations. We record amortization of deferred leasing costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Details of these deferred costs as of December 31 are as follows:

Intangibles

The average remaining life of in-place lease intangibles is approximately 

2.2

 years and is being amortized on a straight-line basis and is included with depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The fair market value of above and below market leases is amortized into lease income over the remaining lease life as a component of reported lease income. The weighted average remaining life of these intangibles is approximately 

2.8

 years. The unamortized amount of below market leases is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses, intangibles and deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets and was $

Derivative Financial Instruments

We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have designated a derivative as a hedge and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. We may use a variety of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to selectively manage or hedge a portion of the risks associated with our indebtedness and interest payments. Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps and caps. We require that hedging derivative instruments be highly effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. We formally designate any instrument that meets these hedging criteria as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract.  We have 

no

 credit-risk-related hedging or derivative activities.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 

no

 outstanding interest rate derivatives. We generally do not apply hedge accounting to interest rate caps, which had an insignificant value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. 

We may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of an anticipated debt issuance. Upon completion of the debt issuance, the fair value of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.

The unamortized gain on our treasury locks and terminated hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income was $

8.7

 million and $

10.6

 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Within the next year, we expect to reclassify to earnings approximately $

1.0

 million of gains related to terminated interest rate swaps from the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposers, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposers. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes.

We are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on financial instruments which are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Yen and Euro.   We use currency forward contracts, cross currency swap contracts, and foreign currency denominated debt to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain Yen and Euro-denominated receivables and net investments.  Currency forward contracts involve fixing the Yen:USD or Euro:USD exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward contracts are typically cash settled in U.S. dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which includes nonredeemable and redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated properties, limited partners’ interests in the Operating Partnership, and preferred distributions payable by the Operating Partnership on its outstanding preferred units) is a component of consolidated net income. In addition, the individual components of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the aggregate for both controlling and noncontrolling interests, with the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests deducted from comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders.

The Operating Partnership

Our evaluation of the appropriateness of classifying the Operating Partnership’s common units of partnership interest, or units, held by Simon and the Operating Partnership's limited partners within permanent equity considered several significant factors. First, as a limited partnership, all decisions relating to the Operating Partnership’s operations and distributions are made by Simon, acting as the Operating Partnership’s sole general partner. The decisions of the general partner are made by Simon's Board of Directors or management. The Operating Partnership has no other governance structure. Secondly, the sole asset of Simon is its interest in the Operating Partnership. As a result, a share of common stock of Simon, or common stock, if owned by the Operating Partnership, is best characterized as being similar to a treasury share and thus not an asset of the Operating Partnership.

Limited partners of the Operating Partnership have the right under the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement to exchange their units for shares of common stock or cash, as selected by Simon as the sole general partner. Accordingly, we classify units held by limited partners in permanent equity because Simon may elect to issue shares of common stock to limited partners exercising their exchange rights rather than using cash. Under the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to redeem units held by Simon only when Simon has repurchased shares of common stock. We classify units held by Simon in permanent equity because the decision to redeem those units would be made by Simon.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which includes nonredeemable and redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated properties) is a component of consolidated net income.

Revenue Recognition

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize this variable lease consideration only when each tenant’s sales exceed the applicable sales threshold. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of lease income utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

We structure our leases to allow us to recover a significant portion of our property operating, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotion expenses from our tenants. A substantial portion of our leases, other than those for anchor stores, require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of our operating expenses, including common area maintenance, or CAM, real estate taxes and insurance.  Such property operating expenses typically include utility, insurance, security, janitorial, landscaping, food court and other administrative expenses. This significantly reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation or otherwise. For substantially all of our leases in the U.S. mall portfolio, we receive a fixed payment from the tenant for the CAM component which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning with the adoption of ASC 842. When not reimbursed by the fixed CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements are based on the tenant’s proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses and CAM capital expenditures for the property. We accrue all variable reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all of these expenses as variable lease consideration in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. We recognize differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the subsequent year. These differences were not material in any period presented. Our advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.  Provisions for credit losses that are not probable of collection are recognized as a reduction of lease income.  

In April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of COVID-19 on the application of lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, “Leases.” The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842 when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration.  We have elected to generally account for rent abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or determine we expect to grant, an abatement.

We have agreed to deferral or abatement arrangements with a number of our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussions with our tenants are ongoing and may result in further rent deferrals, lease amendments, abatements and/or lease terminations, as we deem appropriate on a case-by-case basis based on each tenant's unique financial and operating situation. In addition, uncollected rent due from certain of our tenants is subject to ongoing litigation, the outcome of which may affect our ability to collect in full the associated outstanding receivable balances. 

In connection with rent deferrals or other accruals of unpaid rent payments, if we determine that rent payments are probable of collection, we will continue to recognize lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term along with associated tenant receivables. However, if we determine that such deferred rent payments or other accrued but unpaid rent payments are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on the cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct write-off against lease income in the period of the change in our collectability determination.  Additionally, our assessment of collectability incorporates information regarding a tenant’s financial condition that is obtained from available financial data, the expected outcome of contractual disputes and other matters, and our communications and negotiations with the tenant.

When a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances. Our ongoing assessment incorporates, among other things, the timing of a tenant’s bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumptions by the tenant in bankruptcy proceedings of leases at the Company’s properties on substantially similar terms.  Refer to note 9 for further disclosure of lease income.  

Management Fees and Other Revenues

Management fees and other revenues are generally received from our unconsolidated joint venture properties as well as third parties. Management fee revenue is earned based on a contractual percentage of joint venture property revenue. Development fee revenue is earned on a contractual percentage of hard costs to develop a property. Leasing fee revenue is earned on a contractual per square foot charge based on the square footage of current year leasing activity.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

Revenues from insurance premiums charged to unconsolidated properties are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Insurance losses on these policies and our self-insurance for our consolidated properties are reflected in property operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and include estimates for losses incurred but not reported as well as losses pending settlement. Estimates for losses are based on evaluations by third-party actuaries and management’s estimates. Total insurance reserves for our insurance subsidiaries and other self-insurance programs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 approximated $

71.6

 million and $

74.5

 million, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Information related to the securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive insurance subsidiary is included within the “Equity Instruments and Debt Securities” section above.

Income Taxes

Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. In order to maintain this REIT status, the regulations require the entity to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income to its owners and meet certain other asset and income tests as well as other requirements. We intend to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain Simon’s REIT status and that of the REIT subsidiaries. As REITs, these entities will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Thus, we made 

no

 provision for U.S. federal income taxes for these entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If Simon or any of the REIT subsidiaries fail to qualify as a REIT, and if available relief provisions do not apply, Simon or that entity will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it failed to qualify. If Simon or any of the REIT subsidiaries loses its REIT status it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless the failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied.

We have also elected taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, status for some of our subsidiaries. This enables us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and participate in activities that do not qualify as “rents from real property”. For these entities, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from the change in circumstances that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in income.

As a partnership, the allocated share of the Operating Partnership’s income or loss for each year is included in the income tax returns of the partners; accordingly, no accounting for income taxes is required in the accompanying consolidated financial statements other than as discussed above for our TRSs. 

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net deferred tax liabilities of $

251.1

 million and $

257.7

 million, respectively, which primarily relate to the temporary differences between the carrying value of balance sheet assets and liabilities and their tax bases. These differences were primarily created through the consolidation of various European assets in 2016. Additionally, we have deferred tax liabilities related to our TRSs, consisting of operating losses and other carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes as well as the timing of the deductibility of losses or reserves from insurance subsidiaries, though these amounts are not material to the financial statements. The net deferred tax liability is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  

We are also subject to certain other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, as well as income-based and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments, which are included in income and other taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Corporate Expenses

Home and regional office costs primarily include compensation and personnel related costs, travel, building and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

office costs, and other expenses for our corporate home office and regional offices.  General and administrative expense primarily includes executive compensation, benefits and travel expenses as well as costs of being a public company, including certain legal costs, audit fees, regulatory fees, and certain other professional fees.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses," which introduced new guidance for an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. Instruments in scope include loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, and net investments in leases as well as reinsurance and trade receivables. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, which clarifies that operating lease receivables are outside the scope of the new standard. This standard was effective for us as of January 1, 2020. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform,” which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the US GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to any contract modifications or existing and new hedging relationships through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact that the expected market transition from LIBOR to alternative references rates will have on our financial statements as well as the applicability of the aforementioned expedients and exceptions provided in ASU 2020-04. 

​

4. Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions

We acquire interests in properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We acquire interests in individual properties or portfolios of real estate companies that meet our investment criteria and sell properties which no longer meet our strategic criteria. Unless otherwise noted below, gains and losses on these transactions are included in gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. We capitalize asset acquisition costs and expense costs related to business combinations, as well as disposition related costs as they are incurred. We incurred a minimal amount of transaction expenses during 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Our acquisition and disposition activity for the periods presented are as follows:

2019 Acquisitions

On September 19, 2019, we acquired the remaining 

50

% interest in a hotel adjacent to one of our properties for cash consideration of $

12.8

 million. As of closing, the property was subject to a $

21.5

 million, 

4.02

% variable rate mortgage. We accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and substantially all our investment relates to investment property.

2018 Acquisitions

On September 25, 2018, we acquired the remaining 

50

% interest in The Outlets at Orange from our joint venture partner. The Operating Partnership issued 

475,183

 units, or approximately $

84.1

 million, as consideration for the acquisition. The property is subject to a $

215.0

 million 

4.22

% fixed rate mortgage loan.  We accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and substantially all of our investment has been determined to relate to investment property.

2020 Dispositions

On October 1, 2020, we disposed of our interest in 

one

 consolidated retail property. A portion of the gross proceeds on this transaction of $

33.4

 million was used to partially repay a cross-collateralized mortgage. Our share of the $

million gain is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposed of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income.

2019 Dispositions

During 2019, we disposed of our interests in 

one

 multi-family residential investment. Our share of the gross proceeds on this transaction was $

17.9

 million. Our share of the gain of $

16.2

 million is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income. We also recorded net gains of $

62.1

 million, primarily related to Klépierre’s disposition of its interests in certain shopping centers, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

2018 Dispositions

During 2018, we recorded net gains of $

288.8

 million primarily related to disposition activity which included the foreclosure of 

two

 consolidated retail properties in satisfaction of their $

200.0

 million and $

80.0

 million non-recourse mortgage loans and, as discussed in Note 6, our interest in the German department store properties owned through our investment in HBS was sold during the fourth quarter of 2018. Also, as discussed further in Note 6, Klépierre disposed of its interests in certain shopping centers during 2018, resulting in a gain of which our share was $

20.2

 million.

5. Per Share and Per Unit Data

We determine basic earnings per share and basic earnings per unit based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock or units, as applicable, outstanding during the period and we consider any participating securities for purposes of applying the two-class method. We determine diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock or units, as applicable, outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average number of shares or units, as applicable, that would have been outstanding assuming all potentially dilutive securities were converted into shares of common stock or units, as applicable, at the earliest date possible. The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share and basic and diluted earnings per unit.

6. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and International Investments

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Investments

Joint ventures are common in the real estate industry. We use joint ventures to finance properties, develop new properties and diversify our risk in a particular property or portfolio of properties.  As discussed in Note 2, we held joint venture interests in 

84

 properties as of December 31, 2020 and 

82

 properties as of December 31, 2019. 

Certain of our joint venture properties are subject to various rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, put and call rights, or other sale or marketing rights for partners which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry. We and our partners in these joint ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions), which may result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings, or the use of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, to acquire the joint venture interest from our partner.

We may provide financing to joint ventures primarily in the form of interest bearing construction loans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had construction loans and other advances to these related parties totaling $

88.4

 million and $

78.4

 million, respectively, which are included in deferred costs and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Unconsolidated Entity Transactions

On December 29, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an 

80

% noncontrolling ownership interest in TRG, which has an interest in 

24

 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Under the terms of the transaction, we, through the Operating Partnership, acquired all of Taubman Centers, Inc., or Taubman, common stock for $

43.00

 per share 

113

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

in cash. Total consideration for the acquisition, including the redemption of Taubman’s $

192.5

 million 

6.5

% Series J Cumulative Preferred Shares and its $

170.0

 million 

6.25

% Series K Cumulative Preferred Shares, and the issuance of 

955,705

 Operating Partnership units, was approximately $

3.5

 billion.  Our investment includes the 

6.38

% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for $

362.5

 million issued to us.  The purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition.  Substantially all of our investment has preliminarily been determined to relate to investment property based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date.

On December 7, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of J.C. Penney, a department store retailer, out of bankruptcy. Our non-controlling interest in the venture is 

41.67

% and was acquired for cash consideration of $

125.0

 million. The purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition.

In the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $

55.2

 million, representing our equity method investment balance in 

three

 joint venture properties, which is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

On February 19, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of Forever 21, a retailer of apparel and accessories, out of bankruptcy. The interest was acquired through 

two

 separate joint ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture. Our noncontrolling interest in each of the retail operations venture and in the licensing venture is 

37.5

%. Our aggregate investment in the ventures was $

67.6

 million. In connection with the acquisition of our interest, the Forever 21 joint venture recorded a non-cash bargain purchase gain in the second quarter of which our share of $

35.0

 million pre-tax is included in income from unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

On October 16, 2019, we contributed approximately $

276.8

 million consisting of cash and the Shop Premium Outlets, or SPO, assets for a 

45

% noncontrolling interest in RGG to create a new multi-platform venture dedicated to digital value shopping.  We attributed substantially all of our investment to goodwill and certain amortizing and non-amortizing intangibles.

On September 19, 2019, as discussed in note 4, we acquired the remaining 

50

% interest in a hotel adjacent to one of our properties from our joint venture partner. As a result of this acquisition, we now own 

100

% of this property.

During the first quarter of 2019, we disposed of our interests in a multi-family residential investment. Our share of the gross proceeds was $

17.9

 million. The gain of $

16.2

 million is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

On September 25, 2018, as discussed in Note 4, we acquired the remaining 

50

% interest in The Outlets at Orange from our joint venture partner.  The Operating Partnership issued 

475,183

 units at a price of $

176.99

 to acquire this remaining interest.  As a result of this acquisition, we now own 

100

% of this property.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an 

11.7

%legal noncontrolling equity interest in HBS, a joint venture we formed with Hudson’s Bay Company.  In the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $

36.1

 million, which is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income, to reduce our investment in HBS to its estimated fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $

47.2

 million to reduce our investment in HBS to its estimated fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2018, our interest in the German department store properties was sold to Hudson’s Bay Company and SIGNA Retail Holdings resulting in a gain of $

91.1

 million. These amounts are included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.     

On June 7, 2018, Aventura Mall, a property in which we own a noncontrolling 

33.3

% interest, refinanced its $

1.2

 billion mortgage loan and its $

200.8

 million construction loan with a $

1.75

 billion mortgage loan at a fixed interest rate of 

4.12

% that matures on July 1, 2028.  An early repayment charge of $

30.9

 million was incurred at the property, which along with the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs of $

6.5

 million, is included in interest expense in the accompanying

combined joint venture statements of operations.  Our $

12.5

 million share of the charge associated with the repayment is included in income from unconsolidated entities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  Excess proceeds from the financing were distributed to the venture partners.

In May 2017, Colorado Mills, a property in which we have a noncontrolling 

37.5

% interest, sustained significant hail damage.  During the second quarter of 2017, the property recorded an impairment charge of approximately $

32.5

 million based on the net carrying value of the assets damaged, which was fully offset by anticipated insurance recoveries.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, the property had received business interruption insurance proceeds and also property damage proceeds of $

1.1

 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the property had received business interruption proceeds and also property damage proceeds of $

67.9

 million, which resulted in the property recording a $

3.0

 million gain in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the property had received business interruption proceeds and also property damage proceeds of $

65.9

 million, which resulted in the property recording a $

33.4

 million gain in 2018.  For the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, our $

1.1

 million and $

12.5

 million share of the gain is reflected within the (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

In 2016, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of Aéropostale, a retailer of apparel and accessories, out of bankruptcy and subsequently renamed SPARC Group.  The interests were acquired through 

two

 separate joint ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture.  In April 2018, we contributed our entire interest in the licensing venture in exchange for additional interests in ABG, a brand development, marketing, and entertainment company.  As a result, we recognized a $

35.6

 million non-cash gain representing the increase in value of our previously held interest in the licensing venture, which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. In January 2020, we acquired additional interests of 

5.05

% and 

1.37

% in SPARC Group and ABG, respectively, for $

6.7

 million and $

33.5

 million, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, SPARC acquired certain assets and operations of Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brands out of bankruptcy. At December 31, 2020, our noncontrolling equity method interests in the operations venture of SPARC Group and in ABG were 

50.0

% and 

6.8

%, respectively.

International Investments

We conduct our international operations primarily through joint venture arrangements and account for the majority of these international joint venture investments using the equity method of accounting.

European Investments

  

At December 31, 2020, we owned 

63,924,148

 shares, or approximately 

22.4

%, of Klépierre, which had a quoted market price of $

22.55

 per share, which is below our carrying value. We have evaluated this investment and believe that the impairment is not other-than-temporary. Our share of net income, net of amortization of our excess investment, was $

26.5

 million, $

145.2

 million and $

98.8

 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Based on applicable Euro:USD exchange rates and after our conversion of Klépierre’s results to GAAP, Klépierre’s total assets, total liabilities, and noncontrolling interests were $

20.9

 billion, $

14.4

 billion, and $

1.4

 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $

19.6

 billion, $

12.9

 billion, and $

1.3

 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Klépierre’s total revenues, operating income before other items and consolidated net income were approximately $

1.3

 billion, $

327.3

 million and $

211.2

 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, $

1.5

 billion, $

626.3

 million and $

655.5

 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $

1.6

 billion, $

670.4

 million and $

693.0

 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $

4.3

 million net loss related to the impairment and disposition of certain assets of Klépierre. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Klépierre completed the disposal of its interests in certain shopping centers and we recorded gains of $

58.6

 million and $

20.2

 million, respectively. These transactions are included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

ten

 Designer Outlet properties as of December 31, 2020 and 

nine

 Designer Outlet properties as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in each case, six of which are consolidated by us. As of December 31, 2020, our legal percentage ownership interests in these properties ranged from 

45

% to 

94

%. Due to certain redemption rights held by our venture partner, which will require us to purchase their interests under certain circumstances, the noncontrolling interest is presented (i) in the accompanying Simon consolidated balance sheets outside of equity in limited partners’ preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties and (ii) in the accompanying Operating Partnership consolidated balance sheets within preferred units, various series, at liquidation value, and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties.

In addition, we have a

“Excess Investment” represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the joint ventures or other investments acquired and has been determined to relate to the fair value of the investment properties, intangible assets, including goodwill, and debt premiums and discounts. We amortize excess investment over the life of the related depreciable components of assets acquired, typically no greater than 

40 years

, the terms of the applicable leases, the estimated useful lives of the finite lived intangibles, and the applicable debt maturity, respectively. The amortization is included in the reported amount of income from unconsolidated entities.

General.

  Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. If we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender, including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.

At December 31, 2020, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 

46

 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 

49

 properties and other assets, including 

two

 separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 

five

 properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At December 31, 2020, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

Unsecured Debt

At December 31, 2020, our unsecured debt consisted of $

17.1

 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership, $

125.0

 million outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s $

4.0

 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, $

2.0

 billion outstanding under the $

2.0

 billion delayed-draw term loan facility, or Term Facility, and $

623.0

 million outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s global unsecured commercial paper program, or Commercial Paper program.

(Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

On March 16, 2020, the Operating Partnership replaced in its entirety its existing $

4.0

 billion unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit facility comprised of (i) an amendment and extension of the Credit Facility and (ii) the Term Facility, or together with the Credit Facility and the Operating Partnership’s $

3.5

 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, the Facilities. The Credit Facility and the Term Facility can be increased in the form of either additional commitments under the Credit Facility or incremental term loans under the Term Facility in an aggregate amount for all such increases not to exceed $

1.0

 billion, for a total aggregate size of $

7.0

 billion, in each case, subject to  obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.  Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to 

95

% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Term Facility and Credit Facility are June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Each of the Term Facility and Credit Facility can be extended for 

two

 additional 

six-month

 periods to June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2025, respectively, at our sole option, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent. The Term Facility was available via a single draw during the 

nine-month

 period following March 16, 2020, which the Operating Partnership drew on December 15, 2020.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Operating Partnership’s election, at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 

0.65

% and 

1.40

% or (ii) the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 

0.50

% or LIBOR plus 

1.00

%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 

0.000

% and 

0.40

%. The Credit Facility includes a facility fee determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 

0.10

% and 

0.30

% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a money market competitive bid option program that allows the Operating Partnership to hold auctions to achieve lower pricing for short-term borrowings. Borrowings under the Term Facility bear interest, at the Operating Partnership’s election, at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin determined based on the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 

0.725

% and 

1.60

% or (ii) the base rate (equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 

0.50

% or LIBOR plus 

1.00

%) plus a margin determined by the Operating Partnership’s corporate credit rating of between 

0.00

% and 

0.60

%.  The Term Facility includes a ticking fee equal to 

0.10

% of the unused term loan commitment under the Term Facility, which ticking fee shall commence accruing on the date that is 

forty-five days

 after the closing of the Term Facility.

The Supplemental Facility’s initial borrowing capacity of $

3.5

 billion may be increased to $

4.5

 billion during its term and provides for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. The initial maturity date of the Supplemental Facility was extended to June 30, 2022 and can be extended for an additional year to June 30, 2023 at our sole option, subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof. The base interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is LIBOR plus 

77.5

 basis points, with an additional facility fee of 

10

 basis points. 

On December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $

6.7

 billion under the Facilities. The maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Facilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $

3.9

 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $

1.8

 billion. Letters of credit of $

12.3

 million were outstanding under the Facilities as of December 31, 2020.

The Operating Partnership also has available a Commercial Paper program of $

2.0

 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof. The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  Notes will be sold under customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) 

pari passu

 with the Operating Partnership's other unsecured senior indebtedness.  The Commercial Paper program is supported by the Credit Facility and the Supplemental Facility, or together the Credit Facilities, and if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under either of the Credit Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program. On December 31, 2020, we had $

623.0

 million outstanding under the Commercial Paper program, fully comprised of U.S. dollar denominated notes with a weighted average interest rate of 

0.29

%.  These borrowings have a weighted average maturity date of February 19, 2021 and reduce amounts otherwise available under the Credit Facilities.

We report amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of premiums, and accretion of discounts as part of interest expense. We amortize debt premiums and discounts, which are included in mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, over the remaining terms of the related debt instruments. These debt premiums or discounts arise either at the time of the debt issuance or as part of purchase accounting for the fair value of debt assumed in acquisitions. The accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income include amortization as follows:

Fair Value of Debt

The carrying value of our variable-rate mortgages and other loans approximates their fair values. We estimate the fair values of consolidated fixed-rate mortgages using cash flows discounted at current borrowing rates and other indebtedness using cash flows discounted at current market rates. We estimate the fair values of consolidated fixed-rate unsecured notes using quoted market prices, or, if no quoted market prices are available, we use quoted market prices for securities with similar terms and maturities. The book value of our consolidated fixed-rate mortgages and unsecured indebtedness including commercial paper was $

23.4

 billion and $

23.2

 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair values of these financial instruments and the related discount rate assumptions as of December 31 are summarized as follows:

8. Equity

Simon’s Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify excess common stock into 

one

 or more additional classes and series of capital stock, to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, and qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of such class or series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of additional classes or series of capital stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us without further action of the stockholders. The ability to issue additional classes or series of capital stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of Simon’s outstanding voting stock.

Holders of common stock are entitled to 

one

 vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, other than for the election of directors. The holders of Simon’s Class B common stock have the right to elect up to 

four

 members of Simon’s Board of Directors. All 

8,000

 outstanding shares of the Class B common stock are subject to 

two

 voting trusts as to which Herbert Simon and David Simon are the trustees. Shares of Class B common stock convert automatically into an equal number of shares of common stock upon the occurrence of certain events and can be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the holders.

Common Stock and Unit Issuances and Repurchases

In 2020, Simon issued 

293,204

 shares of common stock to 

20

 limited partners of the Operating Partnership in exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed 

116,658

 units from 

four

 limited partners for $

16.1

 million in cash.  In 2019, Simon issued 

24,000

 shares of common stock to a limited partner of the Operating Partnership in exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Operating Partnership redeemed 

43,255

 units from 

nine

 limited partners for $

6.8

 million in cash.  These transactions increased Simon’s ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.

On December 29, 2020, the Operating Partnership issued 

955,705

 units in connection with the acquisition of an 

80

% ownership interest in TRG, as discussed in Note 6.

On November 18, 2020, we issued 

22,137,500

 shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of $

72.50

 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions.  A portion of the $

1.6

 billion proceeds from the offering, net of issue costs, were used to fund the Operating Partnership’s acquisition of an 

80

% ownership interest in TRG.

On September 25, 2018, the Operating Partnership issued 

475,183

 units in connection with the acquisition of the remaining 

50

% interest in The Outlets at Orange, as discussed in Note 4.

On February 13, 2017, Simon’s Board of Directors authorized a 

two-year

 extension of the previously authorized $

2.0

 billion common stock repurchase plan through March 31, 2019.  On February 11, 2019, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan.  Under the program, the Company could purchase up to $

2.0

 billion of its common stock during the 

two-year

 period ending February 11, 2021.  Simon may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, Simon purchased 

1,245,654

 shares at an average price of $

122.50

 per share.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, Simon purchased 

2,247,074

 shares at an average price of $

160.11

 per share, of which 

46,377

 shares at an average price of $

164.49

 were purchased as part of the previous program.  As Simon repurchases shares under this program, the Operating Partnership repurchases an equal number of units from Simon.

Temporary Equity

Simon

Simon classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that Simon could be required to redeem the security for cash irrespective of the probability of such a possibility. As a result, Simon classifies 

one

 series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity. Each of these securities is discussed further below.

Limited Partners’ Preferred Interest in the Operating Partnership and Noncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties.

  The redemption features of the preferred units in the Operating Partnership contain provisions which could require the Operating Partnership to settle the redemption in cash. As a result, this series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership remains classified outside permanent equity. 

The remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties which are redeemable at the option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside Simon’s control, are accounted for as temporary equity. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to the redemption amount assuming the instrument is redeemable at the balance sheet date. Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded and presented within accumulated deficit in the consolidated statements of equity in the line issuance of unit equivalents and other. There were 

no

 noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  The following table summarizes the preferred units in the Operating Partnership and the amount of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.

 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.

  This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of $

 annually. The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value ($

100.00

 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of common stock at our election.

The Operating Partnership

The Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a possibility.  As a result, the Operating Partnership classifies 

one

 series of preferred units and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.  Each of these securities is discussed further below.

Noncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties   

Redeemable instruments, which typically represent the remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties, and which are redeemable at the option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside our control, are accounted for as temporary equity.  The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to the redemption amount assuming the instrument is redeemable at the balance sheet date.  Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded within equity and are presented in the consolidated statements of equity in the line issuance of unit equivalents and other.  There are 

no

 noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  The following table summarizes the preferred units and the amount of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.

Other Equity Activity

The Simon Property Group 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended.

  This plan, or the 1998 plan, provides for the grant of equity-based awards with respect to the equity of Simon in the form of options to purchase shares, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants and performance-based unit awards. No options have been granted to executives or other employees since 2001, however options may be granted which are qualified as “incentive stock options” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and options which are not so qualified. An aggregate of 

16,300,000

 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1998 plan. 

The 1998 plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of Simon’s Board of Directors, or the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible individuals may participate and the type, extent and terms of the awards to be granted to them. In addition, the Compensation Committee interprets the 1998 plan and makes all other determinations deemed advisable for its administration. Options granted to employees become exercisable over the period determined by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price of an employee option may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Employee options generally vest over a 

three-year

 period and expire 

ten years

 from the date of grant.

Directors who are not also our employees or employees of our affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the 1998 plan. Each independent director receives an annual cash retainer of $

110,000

, and an annual restricted stock award with a grant date value of $

175,000

. Committee chairs receive annual retainers for the Company’s Audit, Compensation, and Governance and Nominating Committees of $

35,000

50,000

.  These retainers are paid 

50

.  Once vested, the delivery of the shares of restricted stock (including reinvested dividends) is deferred under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the director retires, dies or becomes disabled or otherwise no longer serves as a director. The directors may vote and are entitled to receive dividends on the underlying shares; however, any dividends on the shares of restricted stock must be reinvested in shares of common stock and held in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the shares of restricted stock are delivered to the former director.

In accordance with its terms, the 1998 Plan expired on December 31, 2018.  The shares of common stock that were available for grant under the 1998 Plan at the time of its expiration are not available for grant under the 2019 Plan.

Stock Based Compensation

Awards under our stock based compensation plans primarily take the form of LTIP units and restricted stock grants. Restricted stock and awards under the LTIP programs are either market or performance-based and are based on various individual, corporate and business unit performance measures as further described below. The expense related to these programs, net of amounts capitalized, is included within home and regional office costs and general and administrative costs in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income.

LTIP Programs.

  The Compensation Committee has approved long-term, performance based incentive compensation programs, or the LTIP programs, for certain senior employees. Awards under the LTIP programs take the form of LTIP units, a form of limited partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership, which are subject to the participant maintaining employment with us through certain dates and other conditions as described in the applicable award agreements. Awarded LTIP units not earned in accordance with the conditions set forth in the applicable award agreements are forfeited. Earned and fully vested LTIP units are equivalent to units of the Operating Partnership. During the performance period, participants are entitled to receive distributions on the LTIP units awarded to them equal to 

10

% of the regular quarterly distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership. As a result, we account for these LTIP units as participating securities under the two-class method of computing earnings per share.

In 2018, the Compensation Committee established and granted awards under a redesigned LTIP program, or the 2018 LTIP program.  Awards under the 2018 LTIP program were granted in 

two

 tranches, Tranche A LTIP units and Tranche B LTIP units.  Each of the Tranche A LTIP units and the Tranche B LTIP units will be considered earned if, and only to the extent to which, the respective goals based on Funds From Operations, or FFO, per share or Relative TSR Goal performance criteria, as defined in the applicable award agreements, are achieved during the applicable 

two-year

 and 

three-year

 performance periods of the Tranche A LTIP units and Tranche B LTIP units, respectively.  One half of the earned Tranche A LTIP units will vest on January 1, 2021 with the other one-half vesting on January 1, 2022. All of the earned Tranche B LTIP units will vest on January 1, 2022.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

The grant date fair value of the portion of the LTIP units based on achieving the target FFO performance criteria is $

6.1

 million for the Tranche A LTIP units and the 

Tranche B

 LTIP units, for a total of $

12.1

 million.  The 2018 LTIP program provides that the value of the FFO-based award may be adjusted up or down based on the Company’s performance compared to the target FFO performance criteria and has a maximum potential fair value of $

18.2

 million.  

In 2019, the Compensation Committee established and granted awards under a redesigned LTIP program, or the 2019 LTIP program.  Awards under the 2019 LTIP program will be considered earned if, and only to the extent to which, the respective performance conditions (based on Funds From Operations, or FFO, per share, and Objective Criteria Goals) and market conditions (based on Relative TSR performance), as defined in the applicable award agreements, are achieved during the applicable 

three-year

 measurement period, subject to the recipient’s continued employment through the vesting date.  All of the earned LTIP units under the 2019 LTIP program will vest on January 1, 2023.  The 2019 LTIP program provides that the amount earned of the performance-based portion of the awards is dependent on Simon’s performance compared to certain criteria and has a maximum potential fair value at issuance of $

22.1

 million.  

The grant date fair values of any LTIP units for market-based awards are estimated using a Monte Carlo model, and the resulting fixed expense is recorded regardless of whether the market condition criteria are achieved if the required service is delivered. The grant date fair values of the market-based awards are being amortized into expense over the period from the grant date to the date at which the awards, if earned, would become vested.  The expense of the performance-based award is recorded over the period from the grant date to the date at which the awards, if earned, would become vested, based on our assessment as to whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved during the applicable performance periods. 

The Compensation Committee approved LTIP unit grants as shown in the table below. The extent to which LTIP units were earned, and the aggregate grant date fair value, are as follows:

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

  The 1998 and 2019 plans also provide for shares of restricted stock to be granted to certain employees at no cost to those employees, subject to achievement of individual performance and certain financial and return-based performance measures established by the Compensation Committee related to the most recent year’s performance. Once granted, the shares of restricted stock then vest annually over a 

three-year

 or a 

four-year

 period (as defined in the award). The cost of restricted stock grants, which is based upon the stock’s fair market value on the grant date, is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2020 a total of 

5,858,453

 shares of restricted stock, net of forfeitures, have been awarded under the 1998 plan, and 

481,837

 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units have been awarded under the 2019 plan. 

During 2020, the Compensation Committee established a one-time grant of 

312,263

 time-based restricted stock units under the 2019 Plan at a weighted average fair market value of $

84.37

 per share.  These awards will vest, subject to the grantee's continued service on each applicable vesting date, in one-third increments on January 1, 2022, January 1,

Other Compensation Arrangements.

  On July 6, 2011, in connection with the execution of an employment agreement, the Compensation Committee granted David Simon, Simon’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, a retention award in the form of 

1,000,000

 LTIP units, or the Award, for his continued service through July 5, 2019. Effective December 31, 2013, the Award was modified, or the Current Award, and as a result the LTIP units would become earned and eligible to vest based on the attainment of Company-based performance goals, in addition to the service-based vesting requirement included in the original Award. The Current Award does not contain an opportunity for Mr. Simon to receive additional LTIP units above and beyond the original Award should our performance exceed the higher end of the performance criteria.  The performance criteria of the Current Award are based on the attainment of specific FFO per share goals. Because the performance criteria has been met, a maximum of 

360,000

 LTIP units, or the A units, 

360,000

 LTIP units, or the B units, and 

280,000

 LTIP units, or the C units, became earned on December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively. If the relevant performance criteria had not been achieved, all or a portion of the Current Award would have been forfeited. The earned A units vested on January 1, 2018, earned B units vested on January 1, 2019 and earned C units vested on June 30, 2019. The grant date fair value of the retention award of $

120.3

 million was recognized as expense over the 

eight-year

 term of his employment agreement on a straight-line basis based on the applicable vesting periods of the A units, B units and C units.  

We also maintain a tax-qualified retirement 401(k) savings plan and offer no other post-retirement or post-employment benefits to our employees.

Exchange Rights

Simon

Limited partners in the Operating Partnership have the right to exchange all or any portion of their units for shares of common stock on a 

one

-for-one basis or cash, as determined by Simon’s Board of Directors. The amount of cash to be paid if the exchange right is exercised and the cash option is selected will be based on the trading price of Simon’s common stock at that time. At December 31, 2020, Simon had reserved 

54,751,265

 shares of common stock for possible issuance upon the exchange of units, stock options and Class B common stock.

The Operating Partnership

Limited partners have the right under the partnership agreement to exchange all or any portion of their units for shares of Simon common stock on a 

one

-for-one basis or cash, as determined by Simon in its sole discretion. If Simon selects cash, Simon cannot cause the Operating Partnership to redeem the exchanged units for cash without contributing cash to the Operating Partnership as partners’ equity sufficient to effect the redemption.  If sufficient cash is not contributed,

Simon will be deemed to have elected to exchange the units for shares of Simon common stock.  The amount of cash to be paid if the exchange right is exercised and the cash option is selected will be based on the trading price of Simon’s common stock at that time. The number of shares of Simon’s common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the exchange right will be the same as the number of units exchanged.

9. Lease Income

As discussed in Note 3, fixed lease income under our operating leases includes fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM reimbursements recorded on a straight-line basis.  Variable lease income includes consideration based on sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, utilities, marketing, and certain other items including negative variable lease income as discussed in Note 3.

10. Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

We are involved from time-to-time in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, environmental matters, and litigation in connection with transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that current proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

During the first quarter of 2019, we settled a lawsuit with our former insurance broker, Aon Risk Services Central Inc., related to the significant flood damage sustained at Opry Mills in May 2010. In accordance with a previous agreement with the prior co-investor in Opry Mills, a portion of the settlement was remitted to the co-investor.  Our share of the settlement was approximately $

68.0

 million, which was recorded as other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

Lease Commitments

As of December 31, 2020, a total of 

23

 of the consolidated properties are subject to ground leases. The termination dates of these ground leases range from 2021 to 2090, including periods for which exercising an extension option is reasonably assured. These ground leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments, or a fixed annual rental payment plus a percentage rent component based upon the revenues or total sales of the property. In addition, we have several regional office locations that are subject to leases with termination dates ranging from 2021 to 2028. These office leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments plus pay our share of common area, real estate, and utility expenses. Some of our ground and office leases include escalation clauses.  All of our lease arrangements are classified as operating leases.  We incurred ground lease expense and office lease expense, which are included in other expense and home office and regional expense, respectively, as follows:

Insurance

We maintain insurance coverage with third-party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses, including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the United States. The initial portion of coverage not provided by third-party carriers may be insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance company, Bridgewood Insurance Company, Ltd., or other financial arrangements controlled by us. If required, a third-party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s insurance policy with us. A similar insurance policy written either through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks.

We currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to $

1

 billion. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.

Hurricane Impacts

During the third quarter of 2017, 

two

 of our wholly-owned properties located in Puerto Rico sustained significant property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Maria.  Since the date of the loss, we have received $

81.1

 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers related to the 

two

 properties located in Puerto Rico, of which $

47.5

 million was used for property restoration and remediation and to reduce the insurance recovery receivable.  During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $

5.2

 million and $

10.5

 million, respectively, as business interruption income, which was recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 

During the third quarter of 2020, 

one

 of our properties located in Texas experienced property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Hanna.  We wrote-off assets of approximately $

9.6

 million, and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $

14.3

 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery receivable.

During the third quarter of 2020, 

one

 of our properties located in Louisiana experienced property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Laura.   We wrote-off assets of approximately $

11.1

 million and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $

20.6

 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery receivable.

Guarantees of Indebtedness

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the joint venture property, which is non-recourse to us. As of December 31,2020 and 2019, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $

219.2

 million and $

214.8

 million, respectively. Mortgages guaranteed by the Operating Partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which have estimated fair values in excess of the guaranteed amount.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Our U.S. Malls, Premium Outlets, and The Mills rely upon anchor tenants to attract customers; however, anchors do not contribute materially to our financial results as many anchors own their spaces. All material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant accounts for 

5

% or more of our consolidated revenues.

COVID-19

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a significant negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world in 2020, and, notwithstanding the fact that vaccines have started to be administered in the United States and elsewhere, the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in real estate. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities, including where we own or hold interests in properties, have imposed measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-at-home, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. Governments and other authorities are in varying stages of lifting or modifying some of these measures, however certain governments and other authorities have already been forced to, and others may in the future, reinstate these measures or impose new, more restrictive measures, if the risks, or the tenants’ and consumers’ perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic worsen at any time.  Although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, with tenants adding services like curbside pickup, and while consumer risk-tolerance is evolving, such adaptations and evolution may take time, and there is no guarantee that retail will return to pre-pandemic levels even once the pandemic subsides.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and these measures, the Company may experience material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in our assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by our properties.  

As of October 7, 2020, all of our domestic properties and certain of our retailer investments had reopened.    

11. Related Party Transactions

Transactions with Affiliates

Our management company provides office space and legal, human resource administration, property specific financing and other support services to Melvin Simon & Associates, Inc., or MSA, a related party, for which we received a fee of $

0.6

 million in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018.  In addition, pursuant to management agreements that provide for our receipt of a management fee and reimbursement of our direct and indirect costs, we have managed since 1993 

two

 shopping centers owned by entities in which David Simon and Herbert Simon have ownership interests, for which we received a fee of $

3.3

 million, $

3.9

 million, and $

4.2

 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  

Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

As described in Note 2, our management company provides management, insurance, and other services to certain unconsolidated joint ventures.  Amounts received for such services were $

92.7

 million, $

108.2

 million, and $

111.5

 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  During 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded development, royalty, and other fee income, net of elimination, related to our unconsolidated international joint ventures of $

13.1

 million, $

14.8

 million, and $

16.0

 million, respectively.  The fees related to our international investments are included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  Neither MSA, David Simon, or Herb Simon have an ownership interest in any of our unconsolidated joint ventures, except through their ownership interests in the Company or the Operating Partnership.

 

We have investments in retailers including Forever 21, J.C. Penney, and SPARC Group, and these retailers are lessees at certain of our operating properties.  Lease income from the date of our investments in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income related to these retailers was $

54.1

 million, $

20.9

 million, and $

20.0

 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, net of elimination.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Simon

Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Simon maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Simon’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Our management, with the participation of Simon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Simon’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, Simon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, Simon’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Simon is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, Simon’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by Simon’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

●

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; 

●

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

●

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We assessed the effectiveness of Simon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment and criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2020, Simon’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

The audit report of Ernst & Young LLP on their assessment of Simon's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 is set forth within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have not been any changes in Simon's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Simon's internal control over financial reporting.

The Operating Partnership

Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Operating Partnership maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Simon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Our management, with the participation of Simon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Operating Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, Simon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Operating Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Operating Partnership is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, Simon’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by Simon’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

●

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; 

●

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

●

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We assessed the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment and criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2020, the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Depreciation of our investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income is calculated over the estimated original lives of the assets as noted below.

●

Buildings and Improvements — typically 

10

-

35 years

 for the structure, 

15 years

 for landscaping and parking lot, and 

10 years

 for HVAC equipment.

●

Tenant Allowances and Improvements — shorter of lease term or useful life.

(3)

Initial cost generally represents net book value at December 20, 1993, except for acquired properties and new developments after December 20, 1993. Initial cost also includes any new developments that are opened during the current year. Costs of disposals and impairments of property are first reflected as a reduction to cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition.

(4)

Not developed/constructed by us or our predecessors. The date of construction represents the initial acquisition date for assets in which we have acquired multiple interests.

(5)

Initial cost for these properties is the cost at the date of consolidation for properties previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

(6)

Encumbrances represent face amount of mortgage debt and exclude any premiums or discounts and deferred financing costs.

(7)

Represents the original cost and does not include subsequent currency translation adjustments.
