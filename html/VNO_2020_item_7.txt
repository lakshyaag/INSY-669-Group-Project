Introduction

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") within this section is focused on the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, including year-to-year comparisons between these years. Our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2018, including year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, can be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

In May 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10786, which amends the financial statement requirements for acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, including real estate operations, and related pro forma financial information required under SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 3-05, 3-14 and 11-01. The final rule changed the income and investment tests within SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 1-02(w) used to calculate significance and also raises the significance threshold for reporting acquisitions and dispositions of real estate operations, and dispositions of a business from 10% to 20%. The revised income test will also apply to the evaluation of equity method investments for significance in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X, Rules 3-09, 4-08(g) and 10-01(b)(1). The final rule is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2020, however early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of the final rule in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

In November 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10890, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information. This rule, which became effective on February 10, 2021, amended certain SEC disclosure requirements in order to modernize, simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the amendments eliminate the requirement for Selected Financial Data, streamline the requirement to disclose Supplementary Financial Information, and amend Management's Discussion and Analysis "MD&A". The final rule is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2020, however, early adoption on an Item-by-Item basis is permitted after February 10, 2021. We early adopted the amendments to two items resulting in the elimination of Item 301,

 Selected Financial Data

, and the omission of Regulation S-K Item 302(a),

 Supplementary Financial Information

. The amendments to Item 303

 MD&A

, will be adopted in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 92.8% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2020. All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.

We own and operate office and retail properties with a concentration in the New York City metropolitan area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and investments.

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado’s performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the MSCI US REIT Index (“MSCI”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2020:

Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:

•

maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•

investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•

acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•

developing and redeveloping properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•

investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

Overview - continued 

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds and proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Our business has been adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures taken to curb the spread of the virus. Some of the effects on us include the following:  

•

With the exception of grocery stores and other "essential" businesses, many of our retail tenants closed their stores in March 2020 and began reopening when New York City entered phase two of its reopening plan on June 22, 2020, however, there continue to be limitations on occupancy and other restrictions that affect their ability to resume full operations.

•

While our buildings remain open, many of our office tenants are working remotely.

•

We have closed the Hotel Pennsylvania. In connection with the closure, we accrued $9,246,000 of severance for furloughed Hotel Pennsylvania union employees and recognized a corresponding $3,145,000 income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020.

•

We cancelled trade shows at theMART from late March through the remainder of 2020 and expect to resume in 2021. 

•

Because certain of our development projects were deemed "non-essential," they were temporarily paused in March 2020 due to New York State executive orders and resumed once New York City entered phase one of its state mandated reopening plan on June 8, 2020.

•

As of April 30, 2020, we placed 1,803 employees on furlough, which included 1,293 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC ("BMS"), 414 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania and 96 corporate staff employees. As of February 10, 2021, 50% of furloughed employees have returned to work. The remaining employees still on furlough are from BMS and the Hotel Pennsylvania.

•

Effective April 1, 2020, our executive officers waived portions of their annual base salary for the remainder of 2020.  

•

Effective April 1, 2020, each non-management member of our Board of Trustees agreed to forgo their $75,000 annual cash retainer for the remainder of 2020.

While we believe our tenants are required to pay rent under their leases and we have commenced legal proceedings against certain tenants that have failed to pay rent under their leases, in limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and rent abatements for certain of our tenants. We have made a policy election in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Q&A which provides relief in accounting for leases during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to continue recognizing rental revenue on a straight-line basis for rent deferrals, with no impact to revenue recognition, and to recognize rent abatements as a reduction to rental revenue in the period granted.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we collected 95% (97% including rent deferrals) of rent due from our tenants, comprised of 97% (99% including rent deferrals) from our office tenants and 88% (89% including rent deferrals) from our retail tenants. Rent deferrals generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period not to exceed twelve months.

Based on our assessment of the probability of rent collection of our lease receivables, we have written off $51,571,000 of receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the JCPenney retail lease at Manhattan Mall and the New York & Company, Inc. office lease at 330 West 34th Street. Both tenants have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and rejected their leases during 2020. In addition, we have written off $22,546,000 of tenant receivables deemed uncollectible for the year ended December 31, 2020. These write-offs resulted in a reduction of lease revenues and our share of income from partially owned entities. Prospectively, revenue recognition for lease receivables deemed uncollectible will be based on actual amounts received.

In light of the evolving health, social, economic, and business environment, governmental regulation or mandates, and business disruptions that have occurred and may continue to occur, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and operating results remains highly uncertain but has been and may continue to be material. The impact on us includes lower rental income and potentially lower occupancy levels at our properties which will result in less cash flow available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our shareholders. During 2020, we experienced a decrease in cash flow from operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced collections of rents billed to certain of our tenants, the closure of Hotel Pennsylvania, the cancellation of trade shows at theMART, and lower revenues from BMS and signage. In addition, we recognized $409,060,000 of non-cash impairment losses, net of noncontrolling interests, related to our investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV which are included in “(loss) income from partially owned entities” and $236,286,000 of non-cash impairment losses primarily on wholly owned retail assets which are included in “impairment losses and transaction related costs, net” on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The value of our real estate assets may continue to decline, which may result in additional non-cash impairment charges in future periods and that impact could be material.

Financings

Unsecured Term Loan

On February 28, 2020, we increased our unsecured term loan balance to $800,000,000 (from $750,000,000) by exercising an accordion feature. Pursuant to an existing swap agreement, $750,000,000 of the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.87% through October 2023, and the balance of $50,000,000 floats at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.00% (1.15%

 

as of December 31, 2020). The entire $800,000,000 will float thereafter for the duration of the loan through February 2024. 

Other Financings

 

On August 12, 2020, we amended the $700,000,000 mortgage loan on 770 Broadway, a 1.2 million square foot Manhattan office building, to extend the term one year through March 2022.

Financings - continued

Other Financings - continued

On September 14, 2020, Alexander's, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) ("Alexander's"), in which we have a 32.4% ownership interest, amended and extended the $350,000,000 mortgage loan on the retail condominium of 731 Lexington Avenue. Under the terms of the amendment, Alexander's paid down the loan by $50,000,000 to $300,000,000, extended the maturity date to August 2025 and guaranteed the interest payments and certain leasing costs. The principal of the loan is non-recourse to Alexander's. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.55% as of December 31, 2020) which has been swapped to a fixed rate of 1.72%.

On October 15, 2020, we completed a $500,000,000 refinancing of PENN11, a 1.2 million square foot Manhattan office building. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% (2.90%

 

as of December 31, 2020) and matures in October 2023, with two one-year extension options. The loan replaces the previous $450,000,000 loan that bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.95% and was scheduled to mature in December 2020. 

On October 23, 2020, Alexander's completed a $94,000,000 financing of The Alexander, a 312-unit residential building that is part of Alexander's residential and retail complex located in Rego Park, Queens, New York. The interest-only loan has a fixed rate of 2.63% and matures in November 2027.

On November 2, 2020, we repaid the $52,476,000 mortgage loan on our land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex. The 10-year fixed rate amortizing loan bore interest at 5.14% and was scheduled to mature in February 2021.

Preferred Securities

On November 24, 2020, Vornado sold 12,000,000 5.25% Series N cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, pursuant to an effective registration statement. Vornado received aggregate net proceeds of $291,182,000, after underwriters' discount and issuance costs and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,000,000 5.25% Series N preferred units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series N preferred shares). Dividends on the Series N preferred shares/units are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series N preferred shares/units are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our properties or securities. On or after five years from the date of issuance (or sooner under limited circumstances), Vornado may redeem the Series N preferred shares/units at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption. The Series N preferred shares/units have no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by Vornado.  

Leasing Activity For The Year Ended December 31, 2020

The leasing activity and related statistics in the tables below are based on leases signed during the period and are not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Second generation relet space represents square footage that has not been vacant for more than nine months and tenant improvements and leasing commissions are based on our share of square feet leased during the period.

•

2,231,000 square feet of New York Office space (1,853,000 square feet at share) at an initial rent of $89.33 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 14.4 years. Includes 730,000 square feet (694,000 at our share) for the new Facebook lease at Farley Office and 633,000 square feet (348,000 at our share) for the New York University long-term renewal at One Park Avenue. The initial rent of $89.33 excludes the rent on 174,000 square feet (all at share) as the starting rent for this space will be determined later in 2021 based on fair market value. The changes in the GAAP and cash mark-to-market rent on the 899,000 square feet of second generation space were positive 11.0% and 4.6%, respectively. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $8.75 per square foot per annum, or 9.8% of initial rent. 

•

238,000 square feet of New York Retail space (184,000 square feet at share) at an initial rent of $136.29 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 4.0 years. The changes in the GAAP and cash mark-to-market rent on the 159,000 square feet of second generation space were positive 1.3% and negative 5.9%, respectively. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $16.80 per square foot per annum, or 12.3% of initial rent. 

•

379,000 square feet at theMART (all at share) at an initial rent of $49.74 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 8.5 years. The changes in the GAAP and cash mark-to-market rent on the 374,000 square feet of second generation space were positive 1.5% and negative 1.9%, respectively. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $3.89 per square foot per annum, or 7.8% of initial rent. 

•

371,000 square feet at 555 California Street (260,000 square feet at share) at an initial rent of $108.92 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 8.0 years. The initial rent of $108.92 excludes the rent on a ten-year renewal option for 247,000 square feet (173,000 square feet at share) as the starting rent for this space will be determined in 2024 based on fair market value. The changes in the GAAP and cash mark-to-market rent on the 87,000 square feet of second generation space were positive 54.7% and 39.7%, respectively. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $6.94 per square foot per annum, or 6.4% of initial rent, excluding the ten-year renewal option for 247,000 square feet (173,000 square feet at share).

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 3 - 

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Real Estate

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments which are on a relative fair value basis. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions, and could differ materially from actual results.

Our properties, including any related right-of-use assets and intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates of future cash flows are subjective and are based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, capitalization rates and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results.

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider (i) whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in which we are the primary beneficiary or (ii) whether the entity is a voting interest entity in which we have a majority of the voting interests of the entity. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Management uses its judgement when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to decisions that most significantly impact the performance of the partially owned entity. This includes decisions regarding operating/capital budgets, and the placement of new or additional financing secured by the assets of the venture, among others. We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee.

Investments in unconsolidated partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded when there is a decline in the fair value below the carrying value and we conclude such decline is other-than-temporary. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods, ability to hold, and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates of future cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, capitalization rates and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results.

Critical Accounting Policies - continued

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•

Rental revenues include revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants, lease termination income, revenues from the Hotel Pennsylvania, trade shows and tenant services.

◦

Revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants includes (i) lease components, including fixed and variable lease payments, and nonlease components which include reimbursement of common area maintenance expenses, and (ii) reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance expenses. As lessor, we have elected to combine the lease and nonlease components of our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component. 

◦

Revenues derived from fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable period of the lease, together with renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. 

◦

Revenue derived from the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance expenses and common area maintenance expenses are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. 

◦

We have made a policy election in accordance with the FASB Staff Q&A allowing us to not account for COVID-19 related lease concessions as lease modifications. Accordingly, rent abatements are recognized as reductions to "rental revenues" during the period in which they were granted. Rent deferrals result in an increase to "tenant and other receivables" during the deferral period with no impact on revenue recognition. For any concessions that do not meet the guidance contained in the Q&A, the modification guidance in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, 

Leases

 will be applied. See Note 3 - 

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

◦

Lease termination income is recognized immediately if a tenant vacates or is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shortened remaining lease term.

◦

Hotel revenue arising from the operation of Hotel Pennsylvania consists of room revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Room revenue is recognized when the rooms are made available for the guest.

◦

Trade shows revenue arising from the operation of trade shows is primarily booth rentals. This revenue is recognized upon the occurrence of the trade shows when the trade show booths are made available for use by the exhibitors.

◦

Tenant services revenue arises from sub-metered electric, elevator, trash removal and other services provided to tenants at their request. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred.

•

Fee and other income includes management, leasing and other revenue arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities and includes BMS cleaning, engineering and security services. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred.

We evaluate on an individual lease basis whether it is probable that we will collect substantially all amounts due from our tenants. We recognize changes in the collectability assessment of our operating leases as adjustments to rental revenue. Management exercises judgment in assessing collectability and considers payment history, current credit status and publicly available information about the financial condition of the tenant, including the impact of COVID-19 on tenants' businesses, among other factors. Tenant receivables, including receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents, are written off when management deems that the collectability of substantially all future lease payments from a specific lease is not probable of collection, at which point, the Company will limit future rental revenues to cash received.

Income Taxes

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90%

 

of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders 100%

 

of its REIT taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If Vornado fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

NOI At Share by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019

NOI at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities. NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. NOI at share - cash basis includes rent that has been deferred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent deferrals generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period of time not to exceed twelve months. 

Below is a summary of NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Results of Operations – Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019 - continued

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense was $229,251,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $286,623,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $57,372,000. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $24,458,000 of lower interest expense resulting from lower average interest rates on our variable rate loans, (ii) $22,540,000 of expense in 2019 from debt prepayment costs relating to redemption of our $400,000,000 5.00% senior unsecured notes, (iii) $17,459,000 of lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the mortgage payable of PENN2, (iv) $12,530,000 of lower interest expense resulting from the deconsolidation of mortgages payable of the properties contributed to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV in April 2019, (v) $7,680,000 of lower interest expense resulting from the payoff of the 220 CPS loan, and (vi) $5,045,000 of lower interest expense from the redemption of the $400,000,000 5.00% senior unsecured notes in 2019, partially offset by $31,144,000 of lower capitalized interest and debt expense.

Net Gain on Transfer to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV

During 2019, we recognized a $2,571,099,000 net gain from the transfer of common equity in the properties contributed to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV, including the related step-up in our basis of the retained portion of the assets to fair value.

Net Gains on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets

Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets of $381,320,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of net gains on sale of 220 CPS condominium units. Net gains of $845,499,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consist of (i) $604,393,000 of net gains on sale of 220 CPS condominium units, (ii) $159,292,000 net gain on sale of our 25% interest in 330 Madison Avenue, (iii) $62,395,000 net gain from the sale of all of our UE partnership units, and (iv) $19,477,000 net gain on sale of 3040 M Street.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had income tax expense of $36,630,000, compared to $103,439,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $66,809,000. This decrease was primarily due to lower income tax expense from the sale of 220 CPS condominium units.

Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries

Net loss

 

attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries was $139,894,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24,547,000 in the prior year, an increase of $115,347,000. This increase resulted primarily from the higher allocation of net loss to the noncontrolling interests in our real estate fund investments and $4,289,000 allocated to noncontrolling interests for the non-cash impairment loss recognized on our investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV in 2020.

Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership (Vornado Realty Trust)

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership was $24,946,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income of $210,872,000 in the prior year, a decrease in income of $235,818,000. This decrease resulted primarily from lower net income subject to allocation to Class A unitholders.

Preferred Share Dividends of Vornado Realty Trust

Preferred share dividends were $51,739,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $50,131,000 in the prior year, an increase of $1,608,000.

Same Store Net Operating Income At Share

Same store NOI at share represents NOI at share from operations which are in service in both the current and prior year reporting periods. Same store NOI at share - cash basis is same store NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store NOI at share and same store NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below are reconciliations of NOI at share to same store NOI at share for our New York segment, theMART, 555 California Street and other investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.

Related Party Transactions

See Note 23 - 

Related Party Transactions 

to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion concerning related party transactions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Rental revenue is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs. During 2020, we have experienced a decrease in cash flow from operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced collections of rents billed to certain of our tenants, the closure of Hotel Pennsylvania, the cancellation of trade shows at theMART through 2020, and lower revenues from BMS and signage. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we collected 95% (97% including rent deferrals) of rent due from our tenants, comprised of 97% (99% including rent deferrals) from our office tenants and 88% (89% including rent deferrals) from our retail tenants. Rent deferrals generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period not to exceed twelve months. While we believe that our tenants are required to pay rent under their leases, we have implemented and will continue to consider rent deferrals on a case-by-case basis. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loans and unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales.

As of December 31, 2020, we have $3.9 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and $2.2 billion available on our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. The challenges posed by COVID-19 could adversely impact our cash flow from continuing operations but we anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months together with cash balances on hand will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings, equity offerings and/or asset sales. Consequently, the Company will continue to evaluate its liquidity and financial position on an ongoing basis.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities or redeem our equity securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 20, 2021, Vornado declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.53 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.12 per common share). This dividend, if declared by the Board of Trustees for all of 2021, would require Vornado to pay out approximately $406,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during 2021, Vornado expects to pay approximately $66,000,000

 

of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $29,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.” We have issued senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. As of December 31, 2020, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured revolving credit facilities.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures

 

220 CPS

We are completing construction of a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet at 220 CPS. The development cost of this project (exclusive of land cost) is estimated to be approximately $1.480 billion, of which $1.455 billion has been expended as of December 31, 2020.

Penn District

Farley

Our 95% joint venture (5% is owned by the Related Companies ("Related")) is developing Farley Office and Retail, which will include approximately 844,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 114,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space. The total development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $1,120,000,000, an increase of $90,000,000, which is primarily due to higher projected tenant improvement allowances for the office, restaurant and retail space. As of December 31, 2020, $791,994,000 has been expended, which has been reduced by $88,000,000 of historic tax credit investor contributions (at our share).

The joint venture entered into a development agreement with ESD, an entity of New York State, to build the adjacent Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture's obligations. The joint venture entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders ("Skanska") pursuant to which they built the Moynihan Train Hall on the joint venture's behalf. Skanska substantially completed construction as of December 31, 2020, thereby fulfilling this obligation to ESD. The joint venture, which we consolidate on our consolidated balance sheets, leased the entire property during the construction period and pursuant to ASC 842-40-55, was required to recognize all development expenditures for Moynihan Train Hall. Accordingly, the development expenditures funded by governmental agencies were presented as “Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures” with a corresponding obligation recorded to “Moynihan Train Hall Obligation” on our consolidated balance sheets. On December 31, 2020, upon substantial completion of Moynihan Train Hall, the portions of the property not pertaining to the joint venture's commercial space were severed from its lease with ESD and we removed the "Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures" and the offsetting “Moynihan Train Hall obligation” from our consolidated balance sheets.

PENN1

We are redeveloping PENN1, a 2,545,000 square foot office building located on 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the “MTA”) to oversee the redevelopment of the Long Island Rail Road Concourse at Penn Station (the "Concourse"), within the footprint of PENN1. Skanska USA Civil Northeast, Inc. will perform the redevelopment under a fixed price contract for $396,000,000 which is being funded by the MTA. In connection with the redevelopment, we entered into an agreement with the MTA which will result in the widening of the Concourse to relieve overcrowding and our trading of 15,000 square feet of back of house space for 22,000 square feet of retail frontage space. The total development cost of our PENN1 project is estimated to be $450,000,000, an increase of $125,000,000, which is primarily due to the addition of the Concourse retail redevelopment project and sustainability initiatives, including the installation of triple pane high energy performance windows and the implementation of an electrification program to allow PENN1 to access more clean renewable electricity. As of December 31, 2020, $167,894,000 has been expended.

PENN2

We are redeveloping PENN2, a 1,795,000 square foot (as expanded) office building, located on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $750,000,000, of which $91,219,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2020. 

We are also making districtwide improvements within the Penn District. The development cost of these improvements is estimated to be $100,000,000, of which $19,618,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2020. 

Other

We are redeveloping a 78,000 square foot Class A office building at 345 Montgomery Street, a part of our 555 California Street complex in San Francisco (70.0% interest) located at the corner of California and Pine Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $66,000,000, of which our share is $46,000,000. As of December 31, 2020, $55,261,000 has been expended, of which our share is $38,683,000. 

We are redeveloping a 165,000 square foot office building at 825 Seventh Avenue, located at the corner of 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue (50.0% interest). The redevelopment cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $30,000,000, of which our share is $15,000,000. As of December 31, 2020, $26,508,000 has been expended, of which our share is $13,254,000. 

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan including, in particular, the Penn District.

There can be no assurance that the above projects will be completed, completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance

For our properties (except Farley), we maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which $235,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and we maintain all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake and effective February 15, 2021, excluding communicable disease coverage. For the period February 15, 2020 through February 14, 2021, we and the insurance carriers for our all risk property policy have disagreements as to the applicability of a $2,300,000 sub-limit for communicable disease coverage across our properties. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $350,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for certified terrorism acts with limits of $6.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate (as listed below), $1.2 billion for non-certified acts of terrorism, and $5.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027.

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,759,257 and 20% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.

 For Farley, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of $100,000,000 per occurrence, and builder’s risk insurance including coverage for existing property and development activities of $2.8 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. We maintain coverage for certified and non-certified terrorism acts with limits of $1.85 billion and $1.17 billion per occurrence, respectively, and in the aggregate. 

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.

 

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

 

In July 2018, we leased 78,000 square feet at 345 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, CA, to a subsidiary of Regus PLC, for an initial term of 15 years. The obligations under the lease were guaranteed by Regus PLC in an amount of up to $90,000,000. The tenant purported to terminate the lease prior to space delivery. We commenced a suit on October 23, 2019 seeking to enforce the lease and the guaranty. In December 2020, following a trial, the court issued a tentative ruling in our favor. A final hearing was held on February 1, 2021 and we are awaiting a definitive ruling. On October 9, 2020, the successor to Regus PLC filed for bankruptcy in Luxembourg. We are actively pursuing claims relating to the guaranty against the successor to Regus PLC and its parent, in Luxembourg and other jurisdictions.

In November 2011, we entered into an agreement with the New York City Economic Development Corporation ("EDC") to lease Piers 92 and 94 (the "Piers") for a 49-year term with five 10-year renewal options. The non-recourse lease with a single-purpose entity calls for current annual rent payments of $2,000,000 with fixed rent steps through the initial term. We operate trade shows and special events at the Piers (and sublease to others for the same uses). In February 2019, an inspection revealed that the piles supporting Pier 92 were structurally unsound (an obligation of EDC to maintain) and we were issued an order by EDC to vacate the property. We continued to make the required lease payments through February 2020, with no abatement provided by EDC for the loss of our right to use Pier 92 or reimbursement for lost revenues. Beginning March 2020, as no resolution had been reached with EDC, we have not paid the monthly rents due under the non-recourse lease. As of December 31, 2020, we have a $47,473,000 lease liability and a $34,482,000 right-of-use asset recorded for this lease.

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us, except for the mortgage loans secured by 640 Fifth Avenue, 7 West 34th Street and 435 Seventh Avenue, which we guaranteed and therefore are part of our tax basis. In certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. In addition, we have guaranteed the rent and payments in lieu of real estate taxes due to ESD, an entity of New York State, for Farley Office and Retail. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $1,769,000,000.

 

As of December 31, 2020, $13,549,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Our 95% consolidated joint venture (5% is owned by Related) is developing Farley Office and Retail. In connection with the development of the property, the joint venture took in a historic tax credit investor partner. Under the terms of the historic tax credit arrangement, the joint venture is required to comply with various laws, regulations, and contractual provisions. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, may require a refund or reduction of the Tax Credit Investor’s capital contributions. As of December 31, 2020, the Tax Credit Investor has made $92,400,000 in capital contributions. Vornado and Related have guaranteed certain of the joint venture’s obligations to the Tax Credit Investor.

As investment manager of the Fund we are entitled to an incentive allocation after the limited partners have received a preferred return on their invested capital. The incentive allocation is subject to catch-up and clawback provisions. Accordingly, based on the December 31, 2020 fair value of the Fund assets, at liquidation we would be required to make a $29,800,000

 

payment to the limited partners, net of amounts owed to us, representing a clawback of previously paid incentive allocations, which would have no income statement impact as it was previously accrued.

As of December 31, 2020, we expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $10,700,000.

As of December 31, 2020, we have construction commitments aggregating approximately $451,000,000.

Vornado Realty Trust

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 19 – 

(Loss) Income Per Share/(Loss) Income Per Class A Unit

, in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
