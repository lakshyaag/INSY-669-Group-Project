ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

A significant portion of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We seek to manage this foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities.

From time to time, foreign exchange risk is managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations and from intercompany loans. Viatris’ primary areas of foreign exchange risk relative to the U.S. Dollar are the Euro, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Pound Sterling and South Korean Won. Any unhedged foreign exchange exposures continue to be subject to market fluctuations.

Our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. The fair values of these instruments were determined as follows:

•

foreign currency forward-exchange contracts — net present values

•

foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, debt and loans — changes in exchange rates

In this sensitivity analysis, we assumed that the change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. Dollar would not have an effect on other currencies’ rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. All other factors were held constant.

If there were an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10%, the expected net effect on net income related to Viatris’s foreign currency denominated financial instruments would not be material.

The Company is also exposed to translation risk on non-U.S. dollar-denominated net assets. Non-U.S. dollar borrowings, principally our Euro denominated long-term debt, are used to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates and are designated as hedges of net investments. The foreign exchange gains or losses on these hedges is included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If our net investment decreases below the equivalent value of the non-U.S. debt borrowings, the change in the remeasurement basis of the debt would be subject to recognition in net income as changes occur.

Interest Rate and Long-Term Debt Risk

Viatris’ exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from our U.S. Dollar and Euro borrowings and U.S. Dollar investments. We invest primarily on a variable-rate basis and we borrow on both a fixed and variable basis. In order to maintain a certain ratio of fixed to variable rate debt, from time to time, depending on market conditions, Viatris will use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variable-rate borrowings or to convert fixed-rate borrowings to variable interest rates.

78

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2020, Viatris’ outstanding fixed rate borrowings consist principally of $23.30 billion notional amount of senior notes and Euro notes. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate senior notes and Euro notes was approximately $25.90 billion. A 100 basis point change in interest rates on Viatris’ variable rate debt, net of interest rate swaps, would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $17.0 million per year.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of Viatris Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in

 Internal Control - Integrated Framework

 (

2013)

, issued by COSO. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

On November 16, 2020, the combination of Mylan and the Upjohn Business was completed, with Mylan considered the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business. The Upjohn Business represented 7% of the Company’s consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, and assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) represented 48% of the Company’s consolidated total assets, as of December 31, 2020. Management did not include the Upjohn Business when conducting its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.

As a result of this assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria in

 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by COSO.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP’s opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting appears on page 86 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Viatris Inc.:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Viatris, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) earnings, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Goodwill – Mylan N.V. Europe Reporting Unit – Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements.

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company has performed an interim goodwill impairment test and its annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31 and April 1, 2020, respectively. As of March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, the Company had $9.3 billion of consolidated goodwill, $4.43 billion of which was allocated to the Mylan N.V. Europe reporting unit (“Europe reporting unit”). The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company performed its valuation analysis, using both income and market-based approaches, to determine the fair value of its Europe reporting unit. The determination of the fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions, utilizing Level 3 inputs, primarily include, but are not limited to, market multiples, control premiums, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. The fair value of the Europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $1.2 billion, or 11%, as of March 31 and April 1, 2020 and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.

82

Table of Contents

Given that the Europe reporting unit’s revenues are sensitive to changes in consumer demand, the approval of new product launches, the expansion of existing products into new jurisdictions (which have differentiated distribution and commercialization models throughout the region), and the impact of business development activity, auditing management’s judgments regarding forecasts of future revenues, and the selection of the discount rate and terminal growth rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenues (“forecasts”), and the selection of the discount rate and terminal growth rate for the Europe reporting unit included the following, among others: 

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of the goodwill impairment tests, including those over the development of the business forecasts of future revenues and the selection of the discount rate and terminal growth rate. 

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues of the Europe reporting unit by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts by comparing the projections to (1) historical results, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) forecasted information included in Company press releases. We also considered third party reports related to macroeconomic and industry trends, and made inquiries of management, including various regional commercial and operations leaders, to assess key inputs in the forecast assumptions.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, discount rate, and terminal growth rate, including (1) testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and terminal growth rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, (2) developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management, and (3) considering third party macroeconomic reports.

Net Revenue Provisions – Chargebacks Accrual at Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“MPI”) – Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements.

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The Company has agreements with certain indirect customers, such as independent pharmacies, retail pharmacy chains, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers, which establish contract prices for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Viatris will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler’s invoice price. Such credits are called chargebacks. The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex provision in the context of the Company’s gross-to-net adjustments in the determination of net revenue. The chargeback accrual recorded at MPI represents the majority of the global chargeback reserve as of December 31, 2020. The Company's recorded estimate is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company’s wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. 

Estimating the amounts to be accrued for chargebacks requires significant estimation as management’s model utilizes historical buying patterns, estimated end-user demand, estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel, contracted sales terms with customers, as well as other competitive factors. Given the volume of chargebacks and the level of estimation uncertainty involved, auditing management’s judgments required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the Net Revenue Provisions – Chargebacks accrual included the following, among others: 

•

We evaluated the Company’s methodology and assumptions in developing their chargeback accruals, including assessing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management in their estimates. 

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the calculation of the chargebacks reserves.

•

We compared prior period chargebacks accruals to chargeback credits subsequently issued to evaluate management’s ability to accurately forecast chargeback activity. 

83

Table of Contents

•

We developed independent expectations of product-level chargeback accruals and chargeback accruals in the aggregate using the following; 1) customer contracts, 2) historical sales and chargeback activity, 3) third-party channel inventory for select wholesalers, and 4) credits subsequently issued to period end and compared those to the recorded amounts.

Net Revenue Provisions – Sales Returns Accrual at MPI – Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements

.

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The Company provides customers with the ability to return product, which varies country by country in accordance with local practices, generally within a specified period prior (six months) and subsequent (twelve months) to the expiration date. The Company’s estimate of the provision for returns is generally based upon historical experience with actual returns. The returns reserve at MPI represents a significant component of the global sales returns reserve as of December 31, 2020.

Estimating the amounts to be accrued for returns requires significant estimation as management’s model utilizes historical experience with actual returns and considers levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance into the market of additional competitors, and changes in the regulatory environment. Given the volume of sales returns and the level of estimation uncertainty involved, auditing management’s judgments required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

 

Our audit procedures related to the Net Revenue Provisions – Sales Returns accrual included the following, among others:

 

•

We evaluated the Company’s methodology and assumptions in developing their sales returns accrual model, including assessing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management in their estimates.

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the calculation of the sales returns reserve at MPI.

•

We compared prior period sales returns accruals to sales returns credits subsequently issued to evaluate management’s ability to accurately forecast sales returns activity. 

•

We developed independent expectations of product-level sales returns accruals and sales returns accruals in the aggregate using the following: 1) historical sales and returns activity, 2) remaining shelf life information, 3) finished goods inventory on-hand at the end of the period, and 4) adjustments for known or anticipated sales return activity based on market dynamics (market prior to Viatris launch, impact of competition, and overall regulatory environment) and compared those to the recorded amounts.

Upjohn Business Combination Agreement – Refer to Notes 4 and 12 to the financial statements.

Critical Audit Matter Description

Viatris Inc. was formed in November 2020 through the combination of Mylan and Upjohn, a legacy division of Pfizer (“the Combination”). The transaction between Mylan and Viatris involved multiple legal entity restructuring transactions and a reverse merger acquisition with Viatris representing the legal acquirer and Mylan representing the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business. The Company applied the acquisition method to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the Upjohn Business. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price included $18.04 billion of identified intangible assets, which were valued based on company specific information and financial projections which are not observable in the market and are thus considered Level 3 fair value measurements as defined by U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company evaluated its tax positions arising from the legal entity restructuring transactions for those positions considered to be more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position. 

Given that the accounting for the transaction required management to make (1) significant judgments related to the accounting acquirer determination, (2) significant estimates and assumptions, in particular those associated with the valuation of the acquired intangible assets, and (3) significant judgments in analyzing and interpreting tax laws and positions across multiple jurisdictions arising from the legal entity restructuring transactions, performing audit procedures to evaluate the accounting for the transaction required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value and tax specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

84

Table of Contents

Our audit procedures related to the accounting for the transaction included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the transaction, including controls over management’s determination of accounting acquirer, application of the acquisition method, and evaluation of uncertain tax positions. 

•

We evaluated the determination of the accounting acquirer in the combination with the assistance of our subject matter experts.

•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of future cash flows of the acquired intangible assets by comparing the projections to (1) historical Upjohn results (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) third party industry reports. Further, we made inquiries of management, including various regional commercial and operations leaders, to assess key inputs in the forecast assumptions.

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, and we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by: 

–

Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.

–

Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. 

•

With the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated the uncertain tax positions associated with the transaction by:

–

Obtaining management’s detailed step-by-step plan of the pre-close and post-close transactions and evaluating whether tax consequences of the transactions are consistent with our interpretation.

–

Obtaining copies of technical tax support, including memorandums, and evaluating whether the conclusions reached are reasonable and supportable and consistent with our interpretation.

–

Testing the underlying calculations and assumptions used to support reserves related to tax uncertainty.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Viatris Inc.: 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Viatris, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of the Upjohn Business, which was acquired on November 16, 2020. The Upjohn Business represented 7% of the Company’s consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) represented 48% of the Company’s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the Upjohn Business.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Viatris’ portfolio comprises more than 1,400 approved molecules across a wide range of key therapeutic areas, including globally recognized iconic and key brands, generic, complex generic, and biosimilar products. Viatris operates approximately 50 manufacturing sites worldwide that produce oral solid doses, injectables, complex dosage forms and APIs. Viatris is headquartered in the U.S., with global centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Shanghai, China and Hyderabad, India.

Viatris reports segment information on the basis of markets and geography. In conjunction with the formation of Viatris, the Company has changed its reportable segments, from North America, Europe, and Rest of World, to Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets. This approach reflects the Company’s focus on bringing its broad and diversified portfolio of branded, complex generics and biosimilars, and generic products to people in markets everywhere. Our Developed Markets segment comprises our operations primarily in North America and Europe. Our Greater China segment includes our operations in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Our JANZ segment reflects our operations in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Our Emerging Markets segment encompasses our operations in countries with developing markets and emerging economies including countries in Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, Africa and Eastern Europe, and also includes the Company’s anti-retroviral franchise.

 

In accordance with 

ASC 805, Business Combinations

, Mylan is considered the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business and all historical financial information of the Company prior to November 16, 2020 represents Mylan’s historical results and the Company’s thereafter.

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Viatris and those of its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in equity method affiliates are recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of the affiliates’ cumulative results of operations, capital contributions and distributions. Noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries are generally recorded net of tax as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements.

 The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currencies.

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of Viatris. Statements of Operations and Cash Flows of all of the Company’s subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than U.S. Dollars are translated at a weighted average exchange rate for the period for inclusion in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, whereas assets and liabilities are translated at the end of the period exchange rates for inclusion in the consolidated balance sheets. Translation differences are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity as foreign currency translation adjustments. Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currency, which arise as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

 Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.

Debt and Equity Securities.

 Debt securities classified as available-for-sale on the date of purchase are recorded at fair value, with net unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a 

92

Table of Contents

component of shareholders’ equity. Net realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale debt securities are computed on a specific security basis and are included in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Debt securities classified as trading securities are valued using the quoted market price from broker or dealer quotations or transparent pricing sources at the reporting date. Fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness, credit risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity. Debt securities are reviewed for impairment by assessing if the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary.

Investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost minus any impairment, plus or minus changes in their estimated fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Investments in entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting when the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the investee is maintained. The share of net income or losses of equity method investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values and investments in equity accounted for using the equity method are assessed for potential impairment on a quarterly basis based on qualitative factors.

Concentrations of Credit Risk.

 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of interest-bearing investments, derivatives and accounts receivable.

Viatris invests its excess cash in high-quality, liquid money market instruments, principally overnight deposits and highly rated money market funds. The Company maintains deposit balances at certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. Periodically, the Company reviews the creditworthiness of its counterparties to derivative transactions, and it does not expect to incur a loss from failure of any counterparties to perform under agreements it has with such counterparties.

Inventories.

 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost principally determined by the weighted average cost method. Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory, including pre-launch inventory, are made based on our analysis of product dating, inventory levels, historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts. Included as a component of cost of sales is expense related to the net realizable value of inventories.

 

Property, Plant and Equipment.

 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and recorded on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated service lives (

3

 to 

18

 years for machinery and equipment and other fixed assets and 

15

 to 

39

 years for buildings and improvements). Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from 

3

 to 

7

 years.

 

Intangible Assets and Goodwill.

 Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is generally recorded on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 

3

 to 

20

 years. The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of intangible assets and makes adjustments when events indicate that a shorter life is appropriate.

The Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of the ASC 805, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The cost to acquire businesses is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized at the date of acquisition and, at that time, such IPR&D assets have indefinite lives. As products in development are approved for sale, amounts are allocated to product rights and licenses and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

Purchases of developed products and licenses that are accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over an estimated useful life. IPR&D assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition are expensed immediately if they have no alternative future uses.

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based on management's assessment of the fair value of the Company's reporting units as compared to their related carrying value. Under the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the 

93

Table of Contents

fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to use qualitative factors and determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount is less than its fair value, then no impairment is recognized. If the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. 

Indefinite-lived intangibles, principally IPR&D, are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The impairment test for IPR&D consists of a comparison of the asset’s fair value with its carrying value. Impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of IPR&D assets, which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans, is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested.

Contingent Consideration.

 Viatris records contingent consideration resulting from business acquisitions at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to litigation settlements and other contingencies, net within the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates, payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps, regulatory approvals, market launches, sales targets and profitability. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. 

Significant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period. Accordingly, changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

 The carrying values of long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, are evaluated periodically in relation to the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets and monitored for other potential triggering events. The assessment for impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows.

Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates, as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping. Any future long-lived assets impairment charges could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Short-Term Borrowings.

 The Company’s subsidiaries in India have working capital facilities with several banks which are secured by its current assets. MPI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, also has the CP Notes, Receivables Facility, which will expire in April 2022 and the Note Securitization Facility. Under the terms of each of the Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility, certain of our accounts receivable secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. As the accounts receivable do not transfer to the banks, any amounts outstanding under the facilities are recorded as borrowings and the underlying receivables continue to be included in accounts receivable, net, in the consolidated balance sheets.

Revenue Recognition. 

The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 606. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes net revenue for product sales when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including discounts, rebates, governmental rebate programs, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The following section briefly describes the nature of our provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated:

94

Table of Contents

•

Chargebacks

: the Company has agreements with certain indirect customers, such as independent pharmacies, retail pharmacy chains, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers, which establish contract prices for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Viatris will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler’s invoice price. Such credits are called chargebacks. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels.

•

Rebates, promotional programs and other sales allowances

: this category includes rebate and other programs to assist in product sales. These programs generally provide that the customer receives credit directly related to the amount of purchases or credits upon the attainment of pre-established volumes. Also included in this category are prompt pay discounts, administrative fees and price adjustments to reflect decreases in the selling prices of products. 

•

Returns

: consistent with industry practice, Viatris maintains a return policy that allows customers to return a product, which varies country by country in accordance with local practices, generally within a specified period prior (six months) and subsequent (twelve months) to the expiration date. The Company’s estimate of the provision for returns is generally based upon historical experience with actual returns. Generally, returned products are destroyed and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.

•

Governmental rebate programs

: government reimbursement programs in the U.S. include Medicare, Medicaid, and State Pharmacy Assistance Programs established according to statute, regulations and policy. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products that are covered by the Medicaid program are required to pay rebates to each state based on a statutory formula set forth in the Social Security Act. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible to obtain discounted prescription drug coverage from private sector providers. In addition, certain states have also implemented supplemental rebate programs that obligate manufacturers to pay rebates in excess of those required under federal law. Our estimate of these rebates is based on the historical trends of rebates paid as well as on changes in wholesaler inventory levels and increases or decreases in the level of sales. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap” based on historical experience of prescriptions and utilization expected to result in the discount of the “coverage gap”.

Outside the U.S. the majority of our pharmaceutical sales are contractually or legislatively governed. In certain European countries, certain rebates are calculated on the governments total pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sale thresholds. We utilize historical data and obtain third party information to determine the adequacy of these accruals. Also, this provision includes price reductions that are mandated by law outside of the U.S. 

Our net sales may be impacted by wholesaler and distributor inventory levels of our products, which can fluctuate throughout the year due to the seasonality of certain products, pricing, the timing of product demand, purchasing decisions and other factors. Such fluctuations may impact the comparability of our net sales between periods.

Consideration received from licenses of intellectual property is recorded as other revenues. Royalty or profit share amounts, which are based on sales of licensed products or technology, are recorded when the customer’s subsequent sales or usages occur. Such consideration is included in other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

 

Research and Development.

 R&D expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

Income Taxes.

 Income taxes have been provided for using an asset and liability approach in which deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of events that the Company has already recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. Changes in enacted tax rates or laws may result in adjustments to the recorded tax assets or liabilities in the period that the new tax law is enacted.

Earnings per Share.

 Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to holders of Viatris Inc. common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to holders of Viatris Inc. common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding related to potentially dilutive securities or instruments, if the impact is dilutive.

The weighted average shares outstanding used in the computation of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the effect of the 689.9 million shares issued for the closing of the Combination.

Additional stock awards and restricted ordinary shares were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for each respective period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Excluded shares also include certain share-based compensation awards and restricted shares whose performance conditions had not been fully met. Such excluded shares and anti-dilutive awards represented

Share-Based Compensation.

 The fair value of share-based compensation is recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period.

Derivatives.

 From time to time the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments (mainly foreign currency exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and purchased equity call options) designed to: 1) hedge the cash flows resulting from existing assets and liabilities and transactions expected to be entered into over the next 24 months in currencies other than the functional currency, 2) hedge the variability in interest expense on floating rate debt, 3) hedge the fair value of fixed-rate notes, 4) hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact future debt issuances, 5) hedge cash or share payments required on conversion of issued convertible notes, 6) hedge a net investment in a foreign operation, or 7) economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the purchase price of non-U.S. acquisitions. Derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. When the derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value are deferred through other comprehensive earnings. If a derivative instrument qualifies as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged items, are generally included in interest expense. When such instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting the changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within other expense, net

. 

Financial Instruments.

 The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of short-term and long-term debt, interest rate swaps, forward contracts and option contracts. The Company’s financial instruments also include cash and cash equivalents as well as accounts and other receivables and accounts payable, the fair values of which approximate their carrying values. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging foreign currency and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations, or to hedge cash, and have been used to hedge share payments required on conversion of issued convertible notes. The Company carries derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, determined by reference to market data such as forward rates for currencies, implied volatilities, and interest

rate swap yield curves. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. In addition, the Company has designated certain long-term debt instruments as net investment hedges.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements. 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards and Amended SEC Rules

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, 

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses 

(“ASU 2016-13”)

,

 which requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, 

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relie

f (“ASU 2019-05”). ASU 2019-05 provides transition relief for ASU 2016-13 by providing entities with an alternative to irrevocably elect the fair value option for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost upon adoption of ASU 2016-13. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2016-13 and its subsequent revisions as of January 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-13, 

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement

 (“ASU 2018-03”), which adds to and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements including a requirement to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and a requirement to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-15, 

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract 

(“ASU 2018-15”). The objective of this update is to clarify and align the accounting and capitalization of implementation costs for hosting arrangements, regardless of whether they convey a license to the hosted software. The updated guidance will require an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract, to follow guidance in ASC Topic 350, 

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,

 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset and which costs to expense. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-15 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-18, 

Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808)—Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 

(“ASU 2018-18”). The amendments in ASU 2018-18 make targeted improvements to U.S. GAAP for collaborative arrangements by clarifying that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under Topic 606 when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer in the context of a unit of account. In those situations, all the guidance in Topic 606 should be applied, including recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements. In addition, unit-of-account guidance in Topic 808 was aligned with the guidance in Topic 606 (that is, a distinct good or service) when an entity is assessing whether the collaborative arrangement or a part of the arrangement is within the scope of Topic 606. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-18 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In March 2020, the SEC amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X regarding the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered. Among other things, the amendments narrow the circumstances that require separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors and streamline the alternative disclosures required in lieu of those financial statements. The effective date of the amendment is January 4, 2021 with earlier voluntary compliance permitted. We have chosen to voluntarily comply with the amended rules effective during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and have included the required disclosures as a component of
