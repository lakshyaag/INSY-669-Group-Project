s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. (“Franklin”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) should be read in conjunction with the “Forward-looking Statements” disclosure set forth in Part I and the “Risk Factors” set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K (this “Annual Report”) and in any more recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), each of which describe our risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail. 

OVERVIEW 

We are a global investment management organization and derive our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services in jurisdictions worldwide for investors in our investment products, which include our sponsored funds, as well as institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, retail separately managed account programs, sub-advised products, and other investment vehicles. In addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. We may perform services directly or through third parties. We offer our services and products under our various distinct brand names, including, but not limited to, Franklin

®

, Templeton

®

, Legg Mason

®

, Balanced Equity Management

®

, Benefit Street Partners

®

, Darby

®

, Edinburgh Partners™, Fiduciary Trust™, Franklin Bissett

®

, Franklin Mutual Series

®

, K2

®

 and LibertyShares

®

. In addition, pursuant to our acquisition of Legg Mason, Inc. (“Legg Mason”) on July 31, 2020, we acquired certain additional brand names including Brandywine Global Investment Management

®

, Clarion Partners

®

, ClearBridge Investments

®

, Martin Currie

®

, QS Investors

®

, Royce

®

 Investment Partners and Western Asset Management Company

®

. We offer a broad product mix of fixed income, equity, multi-asset, alternative and cash management asset classes and solutions that meet a wide variety of specific investment goals and needs for individual and institutional investors. We also provide sub-advisory services to certain investment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to investors under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis.

The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management (“AUM”). As noted in the “Risk Factors” section set forth above in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, the amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. The level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales, the number of shareholder transactions and accounts, and the fees charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our funds and our clients. These arrangements could change in the future. 

As further noted in the “Risk Factors” section, the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), a highly transmissible and pathogenic disease, has adversely affected, and we expect will continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Global health concerns, and uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19, could lead to further and/or increased volatility in global capital and credit markets, adversely affect our key executives and other personnel, clients, investors, providers, suppliers, lessees, and other third parties, and negatively impact our AUM, revenues, income, business and operations. As of the time of this filing, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is not possible to predict the full extent to which COVID-19 will adversely impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, financial results and operations due to numerous developing factors that are highly uncertain and rapidly changing.

During the fiscal year ended 

September 30, 2020

 (“fiscal year 

2020

”), the global equity markets experienced volatility reflecting, among other things, ongoing global concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, but provided overall strong positive returns. Despite easing of shutdown measures and some signs of economic recovery following significant accommodative economic efforts by governments and central banks, concerns about the severe economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic persist. The S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index increased 

15.2%

 and 

11.0%

 for the fiscal year. 

Our total AUM was 

$1,418.9 billion

 at 

September 30, 2020

, which was 

105%

 higher than at 

September 30, 2019

 reflecting an increase of 

$806.5 billion

 from acquisitions, partially offset by 

$61.6 billion

 of long-term net outflows, 

$9.9 billion

 of cash management net outflows and 

$8.7 billion

 from net market change, distributions and other. Simple monthly average AUM (“average AUM”) 

increased

 

19%

 during fiscal year 

2020

.

The business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. We are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations, registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business, and add complexity to our global compliance operations.

Table of Contents

Uncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. As we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our products and on providing high quality service to our clients. We continuously perform reviews of our business model. While we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop personnel and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. We will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships. The success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section.

 – Acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for information.

In fiscal year 

2020

, the Company changed the presentation of its consolidated statements of income to include dividend and interest income and other expenses from consolidated investment products in non-operating income (expense). Amounts for the comparative prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc.

Defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues.

“Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles. See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions and reconciliations of these measures.

The Company acquired Legg Mason effective 

July 31, 2020

, and the results of operations for fiscal year 

2020

 include two months of Legg Mason’s results. Operating income 

decreased

 

$418.0 million

 in fiscal year 

2020

 due to a 

2%

 decrease in operating revenues and a 

7%

 increase in operating expenses which reflected higher levels of compensation and benefits expense, including acquisition-related retention costs, other acquisition-related expenses, and amortization and impairments of intangible assets and goodwill. Net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. 

decreased

 

$396.8 million

 primarily due to the decrease in operating income, as the impact of declines in market valuations amid global concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in net investment and other losses of 

$38.4 million

, as compared to net gains of 

$141.4 million

 in the prior year, less the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests, was largely offset by lower taxes on income.

Operating income 

decreased

 

$561.3 million

 in the fiscal year ended 

September 30, 2019

 (“fiscal year 

2019

”) due to a 

9%

 decrease in operating revenues and a 

1%

 increase in operating expenses. Net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. 

increased

 

$431.3 million

 primarily due to a prior year estimated income tax charge of 

$968.8 million

 

resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), partially offset by the decrease in operating income.

Diluted earnings per share 

decreased

 in fiscal year 

2020

 and 

increased

 in fiscal year 

2019

, consistent with the changes in net income and the impacts of 

2%

 and 

6%

 decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from repurchases of shares of our common stock.

Table of Contents

Adjusted operating income 

decreased

 

$163.1 million

 

in fiscal year 

2020

 primarily due to a 

10%

 increase in compensation and benefits expense, excluding non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted net income 

decreased

 

$20.3 million

 primarily due to the decrease in adjusted operating income substantially offset by lower taxes on income, excluding the net income tax expense of non-GAAP adjustments. 

Adjusted operating income 

decreased

 

$439.3 million

 in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to an 

8%

 decrease in adjusted operating revenues and a 

6%

 increase in compensation and benefits expense, excluding non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. 

increased

 

$533.2 million

 primarily due to a prior-year estimated income tax charge of 

$968.8 million

 

resulting from enactment of the Tax Act, partially offset by the decrease in adjusted operating income.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share 

decreased

 in fiscal year 

2020

 and 

increased

 in fiscal year 

2019

, consistent with the changes in adjusted net income and the impacts of the decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we revised our presentation of AUM to disclose AUM by asset class and introduced a simplified presentation of long-term net flows to incorporate all client-driven flow activity, which is defined as long-term inflows net of long-term outflows. Additionally, we report cash management net flows as a separate component of total net flows. These changes reflect the new breadth of our business and the expansion of our client base and investment vehicle offerings, both of which expanded significantly beyond retail mutual funds following the acquisition of Legg Mason. 

AUM by asset class was as follows:

15.2%

 and 

11.0%

 in the S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index. 

AUM 

decreased

 

$24.5 billion

 or 

3%

 during fiscal year 

2019

 due to 

$31.8 billion

 of long-term net outflows and 

$20.0 billion

 of net market change, distributions and other, partially offset by 

$26.4 billion

 from an acquisition. Long-term inflows 

increased

 

6%

 to 

$175.0 billion

 due to higher inflows in all the long-term asset classes except the equity asset class, and long-term outflows 

increased

 

2%

 to 

$206.8 billion

 due to higher outflows in the multi-asset and alternative asset classes, partially offset by lower outflows in the equity asset class. Long-term net outflows included outflows of 

$7.0 billion

 from six institutional clients, of which 

$2.9 billion

 was from Canadian mandates and 

$2.1 billion

 was due to two clients’ mandatory redemption policies following portfolio manager departures; 

$4.3 billion

 from two equity funds; 

$2.7 billion

 from a fixed income fund; 

$1.4 billion

 from an institutional fixed income product; 

$1.3 billion

 from a multi-asset fund; 

$1.2 billion

 from two sub-advised institutional products and 

$1.0 billion

 from a sub-advised variable annuity client. The outflows were partially offset by inflows of 

$1.9 billion

 in a fixed income fund and 

$1.8 billion

 in an equity fund. Net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of 

$31.5 billion

 of long-term distributions and a 

$2.9 billion

 

decrease

 from foreign exchange revaluation, partially offset by 

$14.4 billion

 of market appreciation. The foreign exchange revaluation resulted from AUM in products that are not U.S. dollar denominated, which represented 

14%

 of total AUM as of 

September 30, 2019

, and was primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Pound Sterling. The market appreciation occurred in all long-term asset classes except equity, and reflected positive returns in global fixed income markets as evidenced by a 

7.6%

 increase in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index.

The region in which investment products are sold may differ from the geographic area in which we provide investment management and related services to the products.

Investment Performance Overview

A key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our investment products. A measure of the performance of these products is the percentage of AUM exceeding peer group medians and benchmarks. We compare the relative performance of our mutual funds against peers, and our institutional products against benchmarks. Approximately half of our mutual fund AUM exceeded the peer group median comparisons for all periods presented. Our institutional products generated strong long-term results with at least 63% of AUM exceeding the benchmark comparisons for all periods presented, primarily driven by the performance of our fixed income products which had at least 73% of AUM exceeding the benchmark comparisons. 

The performance of our mutual fund products against peer group medians and of our institutional products against benchmarks is presented in the table below.

Mutual fund performance is sourced from Morningstar and measures the percent of ranked AUM in the top two quartiles versus peers. Total mutual fund AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 39%, 38%, 38% and 36% of our total AUM as of 

September 30, 2020

.

Institutional performance measures the percent of institutional AUM beating its benchmark. The benchmark comparisons are based on each account’s/composite’s (composites may include retail separately managed accounts and mutual fund assets managed as part of the same strategy) return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the asset class of the account/composite. Total institutional AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 55%, 54%, 52% and 48% of our total AUM as of 

September 30, 2020

.

Total AUM includes performance of our multi-asset and alternative AUM, which each represent 9% of our total AUM at 

September 30, 2020

.

Mutual fund performance data includes U.S. and cross-border domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and excludes cash management and fund of funds. These results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of October 12, 

2020

 and are subject to revision. While we remain focused on achieving strong long-term performance, our future peer group and benchmark rankings may vary from our past performance.

Investment Management Fees

Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our investment products and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of AUM. Annual fee rates vary by asset class and type of services provided. Fee rates for products sold outside of the U.S. are generally higher than for U.S. products.

Investment management fees 

decreased

 

$3.5 million

 in fiscal year 

2020

 primarily due to a 7% decrease in average AUM, lower effective investment management fee rate and lower performance fees of the legacy Franklin business, largely offset by $427.6 million of revenue earned by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition. The decrease in average AUM of the legacy Franklin business occurred primarily in the fixed income and equity asset classes, partially offset by an increase in the alternative asset class, and across all sales regions except Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Investment management fees 

decreased

 

$382.3 million

 in fiscal year 

2019

 primarily due to a 

6%

 

decrease

 in average AUM, a 

$59.6 million

 decrease from a change in presentation of certain fees from investment management fees to distribution fees upon adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance on 

October 1, 2018

, and a lower effective investment management fee rate, partially offset by higher performance fees. The decrease in average AUM occurred primarily in the equity, fixed income and multi-asset asset classes, partially offset by an increase in the alternative asset class, and across all sales regions, most significantly in the U.S. and Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Our effective investment management fee rate excluding performance fees (investment management fees excluding performance fees divided by average AUM) was 

47.3

, 

56.4

 and 

58.7

 basis points for fiscal years 

2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

. The rate decrease in fiscal year 

2020

 was primarily due to the Legg Mason acquisition, as Legg Mason generally has a lower overall effective fee rate due to a higher mix of institutional and fixed income AUM. The fee rate decrease is also due to higher weighting of AUM in lower-fee products, a shift from higher-fee products in the U.S. sales region to lower-fee products in Europe, Middle East and Africa sales regions for the fixed income asset class, and certain sponsored funds in India with total AUM of $3.4 billion at 

September 30, 2020

, which are subject to the decision of the funds’ trustees to wind up the funds (see Note 

16

 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information), and for which the Company no longer earns investment management fees.

Performance-based investment management fees were 

$44.0 million

, 

$52.9 million

 and 

$21.2 million

 for fiscal years 

2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

. The decrease in fiscal year 

2020

 was primarily due to lower performance fees earned from a private debt fund, separate accounts, and a real estate fund, while the increase in fiscal year 

2019

 was primarily due to the higher fees earned from the same funds. The decrease in fiscal year 

2020

 was partially offset by $15.0 million of performance fees earned by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition.

U.S. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from Lipper, a Refinitiv Company, as of September 30, 

2020

, 

2019

 and 

2018

 and include all U.S.-registered open-end funds that reported expense data to Lipper as of the funds’ most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. As defined by Lipper, management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity and fund of fund products are not included.

The decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 

2020

 and

The decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 

2020

 and 

2019

 reflect higher weightings of one large low-fee passive fund. 

The declines in U.S. industry average management fee rates for long-term asset classes generally reflect increased investor demand for lower-fee passive funds. Our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the U.S. industry average rates as we actively manage substantially all of our products and have a higher level of international AUM, both of which generate higher fees. Our fiscal year 2020 effective fee rates in the U.S. generally decreased to a greater extent than the average industry rates following the acquisition of Legg Mason on July 31, 2020 and are expected to decrease further in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 which will include a full year of Legg Mason results. 

Our product offerings and global operations are diverse. As such, the impact of future changes in AUM on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of asset class, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.

Sales and Distribution Fees 

Sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. Sales commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of sponsored funds at the time of purchase (“commissionable sales”) and may be reduced or eliminated depending on the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, sales fees generally will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. 

Our sponsored mutual funds generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. The majority of our U.S. mutual funds, with the exception of certain money market funds and certain other funds specifically designed for purchase through separately managed account programs, have adopted distribution plans under Rule 12b-1 (the “Rule 12b-1 Plans”) promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Rule 12b-1 Plans permit the funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the Rule 12b-1 Plans’ limitations on amounts based on daily average AUM. We earn distribution fees from our non-U.S. funds based on daily average AUM.

We pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries that sell our funds on our behalf. See the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below.

Contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a contracted period of time. Substantially all of these charges are levied on certain shares sold without a front-end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares. Contingent sales charges

$7.4 million

 and 

decreased

 primarily due to changes in redemptions.

Shareholder Servicing Fees 

Substantially all shareholder servicing fees are earned from our sponsored funds for providing transfer agency services, which include providing shareholder statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. These fees are primarily determined based on a percentage of AUM and either the number of transactions in shareholder accounts or the number of shareholder accounts, while fees from certain funds are based only on AUM. In addition, fund reimbursements of expenses incurred while providing transfer agency services are recognized as revenue effective October 1, 2018 under new revenue recognition guidance.

Shareholder servicing fees

$55.8 million

 in fiscal year 

2019

 primarily related to the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners, L.L.C. (“BSP”).

Special termination benefits relate to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason in fiscal year 

2020

, and voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives of 4.5% of our global workforce in fiscal year 

2019

.

We expect to incur acquisition-related retention expenses of approximately $150 million during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 (“fiscal year 2021”), and amounts that decrease by approximately $20 million per year in the following three fiscal years. At 

September 30, 2020

, our global workforce had 

increased

 to approximately 

11,800

 employees from approximately 

9,600

 at 

September 30, 2019

.

We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits expenses going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue.

Sales, Distribution and Marketing 

Sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily relate to services provided by financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries to our sponsored funds, including marketing support services. Substantially all sales expenses are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues and are determined as a percentage of sales. Substantially all distribution expenses are incurred from assets that generate distribution fees and are determined as a percentage of AUM. Marketing support expenses are based on AUM, sales or a combination thereof. Also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to upfront commissions on shares sold without a front-end sales charge. The deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from related revenues.

Sales, distribution and marketing expenses by cost driver are presented below.

Asset-based expenses 

decreased

 

$107.0 million

 in fiscal year 

2020

 primarily due to 

decrease

s of 

$107.4 million

 from an 

8%

 

decrease

 in the related average AUM and 

$53.4 million

 from a higher mix of lower-fee U.S. assets, partially offset by a 

$58.6 million

 increase in expenses incurred by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition. Asset-based expenses 

decreased

 

$227.9 million

 in fiscal year 

2019

 primarily due to 

decrease

s of 

$161.4 million

 from a 

10%

 

decrease

 in the related average AUM, and 

$64.3 million

 from a lower mix of U.S. Class C assets which have higher expense rates than other share classes. Distribution expenses are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to certain international fee structures that do not provide full recovery of distribution costs.

Sales-based expenses 

decreased

 

$4.0 million

 in fiscal year 

2020

 primarily due to a 

$20.3 million

 

decrease

 from 

lower

 non-U.S. product commissionable sales, largely offset by an 

$8.6 million

 increase in expenses incurred by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition and a 

$7.5 million

 

increase

 from 

higher

 U.S. product commissionable sales. U.S. products typically generate higher sales commissions than non-U.S. products. Sales-based expenses 

increased

 

$2.7 million

 in fiscal year 

2019

 primarily due to increases of 

$22.6 million

 from the recognition of sales commissions on U.S. Class C shares as expense at the time of sale and 

$10.0 million

 from revised U.S. dealer commission pricing effective September 2018, partially offset by 

decrease

s of 

$14.2 million

 from 

lower

 total commissionable sales and 

$12.6 million

 in India primarily related to regulatory-driven changes in fee structure. The recognition of sales commissions on U.S. Class C shares as expense at the time of sale is consistent with the treatment of contract costs with a useful life of one year or less under new revenue recognition accounting guidance adopted on 

October 1, 2018

. The commissions relate to shares sold without a front-end sales charge and were deferred and amortized over one year in prior years. 

Amortization of deferred sales commissions 

decreased

 

$5.5 million

 in fiscal year 

2020

, primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease from lower sales of non-U.S. shares sold without front-end sales charge, partially offset by an $8.6 million increase from higher sales of U.S. shares. Amortization of deferred sales commissions 

increased

 

$5.1 million

 in fiscal year 

2019

, as the impact of higher sales of shares sold without a front-end sales charge was largely offset by the change in accounting for U.S. Class C shares discussed above, which resulted in no further deferral and amortization. The unamortized deferred Class C commission balance of 

$9.1 million

 at 

September 30, 2018

 was reversed against retained earnings upon adoption of the new accounting guidance. 

Information Systems and Technology 

Information systems and technology expenses

In fiscal year 

2020

, the Company changed the presentation of its consolidated statements of income to include dividend and interest income and other expenses from consolidated investment products (“CIPs”) in non-operating income (expense). Amounts for the comparative prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See Note 

1

 - Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information.

Investment and other income (losses), net

 consists primarily of income (losses) from equity method investees, dividend and interest income, rental income from excess owned space in our San Mateo, California corporate headquarters and other office buildings which we lease to third parties, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), and gains (losses) on investments held by the Company.

Investment and other income (losses), net

 

decreased

 

$179.8 million

 in fiscal year 

2020

 primarily due to the impact of steep declines in market valuations on investment income, lower dividend and interest income, and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by an increase in rental income. Losses from equity method investees increased 

$87.7 million

, primarily related to investments in two global equity funds. Dividend income decreased 

$48.1 million

 primarily due to lower yields on money market funds. Net foreign currency exchange losses were 

$22.3 million

 in fiscal year 2020 as compared to net gains of 

$13.1 million

 in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro on cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held in Europe. 

 Interest income decreased 

$16.7 million

 primarily due to lower levels of cash equivalents and debt securities and lower interest rates. The decreases were partially offset by a 

$10.2 million

 increase in rental income due to additional leases which took effect in fiscal year 2020.

Investment and other income (losses), net

 

decreased

 

$58.9 million

 in fiscal year 

2019

 primarily due to losses from equity method investees, as compared to income in the prior year, lower interest income and losses on investments held by the Company, as compared to gains in the prior year. These decreases were largely offset by higher dividend income and higher foreign exchange gains. Equity method investees generated losses of 

$10.4 million

 as compared to income of 

$44.4 million

 in the prior year primarily due to changes in market valuations of investments held by two global equity funds. Interest income decreased 

$45.5 million

 primarily due to lower levels of cash equivalents and debt securities, partially offset by higher interest rates. Investments held by the Company generated net losses of 

$9.7 million

 primarily due to 

$9.0 million

 of other-than-temporary impairment of an available-for-sale debt security, as compared to net gains of 

$6.0 million

 in the prior year. The decreases were partially offset by a 

$45.9 million

 

increase

 in dividend income primarily due to higher yields on, and investments in, money market funds. Net foreign currency exchange gains increased 

$12.5 million

 primarily from the impact of strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro on cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held in Europe. 

Interest expense increased 

$11.0 million

 in fiscal year 

2020

 primarily due to interest expense recognized on debt of Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition. Interest expense decreased 

$23.9 million

 in fiscal year 

2019

 primarily due to 

$12.5 million

 of prior year costs related to early redemption of senior notes and lower debt balances. 

Investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net consists of dividend and interest income and investment gains (losses) on investments held by CIPs. Expenses of consolidated investment products primarily consists of fund-related expenses, including professional fees and other administrative expenses, and interest expense. Significant portions of the investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net and expenses of consolidated investment products are offset in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income.

TAXES ON INCOME 

The Tax Act, which was enacted into law in the U.S. in December 2017, includes various changes to the tax law, including a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 

35%

 to 

21%

 effective January 1, 2018 and assessment of a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiaries’ earnings. We completed our analysis of the Tax Act impact during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 with no significant adjustment to the provisional amounts previously recorded. The transition tax expense recognized in fiscal year 2018 was net of an 

$87.6 million

 tax benefit related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends. This benefit was reversed in fiscal year 2019 upon issuance of final regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury. 

Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 

2020

 was 

22.7%

 as compared to 

26.8%

 in fiscal year 

2019

 and 

66.5%

 in fiscal year 

2018

. The rate decrease in fiscal year 

2020

 was primarily due to the prior-year reversal of the tax benefit included in the transition tax related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends upon issuance of final regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury for the Tax Act, tax benefits from capital losses subsequent to the change in corporate tax structure of a foreign holding company to a U.S. branch, and a statutory rate reduction enacted in India in December 2019. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the tax rate due to a lower mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which includes several corporate tax provisions and was signed into law on March 27, 2020, did not have a material impact on our income taxes. The rate decrease in fiscal year 

2019

 was primarily 

 49

Table of Contents

due to the prior year impact of the transition tax, net of the tax benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory rate, and the current year impact of the lower 21% statutory rate as compared to the prior-year blended statutory rate of 24.5%, partially offset by the reversal of the tax benefit related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends. Our effective income tax rate excluding the one-time impacts of the Tax Act was 

21.6%

 and 

22.7%

 for fiscal years 

2019

 and 

2018

.

Our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contributions of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which have varying tax rates. Changes in our pre-tax income mix, tax rates or tax legislation in such jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for “adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP measures”). Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against industry peers as these measures exclude the impact of CIPs and mitigate the margin variability related to sales and distribution revenues and expenses across multiple distribution channels globally. These measures also exclude performance-based investment management fees which are fully passed through as compensation and benefits expense per the terms of a previous acquisition by Legg Mason and have no impact on net income. These non-GAAP measures also exclude acquisition-related expenses, certain items which management considers to be nonrecurring, unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net, and the related income tax effect of these adjustments, as applicable. These non-GAAP measures also exclude the impact on compensation and benefits expense which is offset by gains and losses in investment and other income (losses), net on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans and on seed investments under certain historical revenue sharing arrangements.

“Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate.

Adjusted Operating Income

We define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following:

•

Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.

•

Acquisition-related retention compensation.

•

Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans and seed investments, which is offset in investment and other income (expense), net.

•

Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities.

•

Amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill.

•

Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason in fiscal year 2020, and voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives of 4.5% of our global workforce in fiscal year 2019.

 50

Table of Contents

Adjusted Operating Margin

We calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define adjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following:

•

Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense.

•

Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf. 

•

Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.

Adjusted Net Income

We define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following:

•

Activities of CIPs, including investment and other income (losses), net, other expenses and income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment products.

•

Acquisition-related retention compensation.

•

Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities and the market-based component of retention awards.

•

Amortization and impairment of intangible assets.

•

Impairment of goodwill and write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of a recently acquired business.

•

Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason in fiscal year 2020, and voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives of 4.5% of our global workforce in fiscal year 2019.

•

Net gains or losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense.

•

Unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net, other than those that are offset by compensation and benefits expense.

•

Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment.

•

Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share

We define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of the adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income.

In calculating adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for activities of CIPs because the impact of consolidated products are not considered reflective of the underlying results of our operations. We adjust for acquisition-related retention compensation, other acquisition-related expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, the write-off of noncontrolling interests, and interest expense for amortization of the Legg Mason debt premium to facilitate comparability of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms. We adjust for special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason in fiscal year 2020 and certain voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives because these items are deemed nonrecurring. In calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net and net gains or losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense because these items primarily relate to seed and strategic investments which have been and are generally expected to be held long term.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 

2020

 primarily due to lower net purchases of investments by CIPs, decreases in investments, net, decreases in receivables and other assets, and a smaller decline in taxes payable, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and decreases in net income. Net cash used in investing activities increased as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions, and net purchases of investments by CLOs, partially offset by net consolidation of CIPs as compared to net deconsolidation in the prior year, higher net liquidation of our investments as compared to the prior year, and lower net additions of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities, as compared to net cash used in the prior year, primarily resulted from proceeds from debt of CIPs and lower repurchases of stock, partially offset by lower net subscriptions in CIPs by noncontrolling interests and payments on debt by CIPs.

Table of Contents

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 

2019

 primarily due to activities of CIPs which had net purchases of investments as compared to net liquidations in the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to cash paid for BSP and higher net additions of property and equipment primarily related to construction of two new buildings at our corporate headquarters campus in San Mateo, California and a purchased office building in Poznan, Poland. Net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to lower dividends paid on, and repurchases of, common stock, higher net subscriptions in CIPs by noncontrolling interests, and a prior-year debt payment.

The assets and liabilities of CIPs attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no right to the CIPs’ assets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management and other fees earned from them. The debt holders of the CIPs have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the CIPs’ liabilities. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CIPs, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.

Our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:

Liquidity 

Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. Cash and cash equivalents at 

September 30, 2020

 primarily consist of money market funds and deposits with financial institutions. Liquid investments consist of investments in sponsored and other funds, direct investments in redeemable CIPs, other equity and debt securities, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.

We utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to sponsored and other products. Certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of cash and/or capital, and may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. Liquid assets used to satisfy these purposes were 

$3,290.9 million

 at 

September 30, 2020

 and 

$3,429.0 million

 at 

September 30, 2019

, including 

$316.6 million

 and 

$263.3 million

 that was restricted by regulatory requirements. Should we require more capital than is available for use, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases or investments in sponsored and other products, or we could raise capital through debt or equity issuance. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense, decreased dividend or interest income, or other dilution to our earnings.

Capital Resources 

We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted private placement program. 

In prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes, to redeem outstanding notes and to finance an acquisition. At 

September 30, 2020

, 

$699.5 million

 of the notes were outstanding with an aggregate principal amount due of 

$700.0 million

. The notes were issued at fixed interest rates and consist of 

$300.0 million

 at 

2.800%

 per annum which mature in 

2022

 and 

$400.0 million

 at 

2.850%

 per annum which mature in 

2025

.

Table of Contents

Additionally, Legg Mason has outstanding senior and junior unsecured unsubordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount due of 

$2,000.0 million

 at 

September 30, 2020

. The notes have fixed interest rates from 

3.950%

 to 

6.375%

 with interest payable semi-annually for senior notes and quarterly for junior notes, and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized premium, of 

$2,319.7 million

 at 

September 30, 2020

.

The senior notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. The junior notes due March 2056 and September 2056 may only be redeemed in whole prior to March 2021 and September 2021, respectively. The indentures governing the senior notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. In addition, the indentures include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at 

September 30, 2020

. 

On 

October 19, 2020

, the Company completed its offering and sale of the 

1.600%

 Notes due 2030 with a principal amount of 

$750.0 million

. The notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows the Company to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price.

At 

September 30, 2020

, we had 

$500.0 million

 of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since 

2012

 and is unrated. 

Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors’ willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. 

Uses of Capital 

We expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business, pay stockholder dividends, invest in our products, pay income taxes and operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, repurchase shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, and service and repay debt. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from share-based compensation, and expect to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time, we will likely spend more of our post-dividend free cash flow investing in our business, including seed capital and acquiring resources to help grow our investment teams, affiliates and operations. 

We repatriate the earnings in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements for all non-U.S. subsidiaries.

We declare dividends on a quarterly basis. We declared regular dividends of 

$1.08

 per share (

$0.27

 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 

2020

, and of 

$1.04

 per share (

$0.26

 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 

2019

. We currently expect to continue paying comparable regular dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors. 

We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and is not subject to an expiration date. The size and timing of these purchases will depend on business conditions, price, market and other factors. During fiscal years 

2020

 and 

2019

, we repurchased 

9.0 million

 and 

24.6 million

 shares of our common stock at a cost of 

$219.4 million

 and 

$756.3 million

. At 

September 30, 2020

, 

38.2 million

 shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization of 

80.0 million

 shares approved by our Board of Directors in April 2018.

We redeemed 

$636.6 million

, net of investments, in our sponsored products during fiscal year 

2020

, and invested 

$128.0 million

, net of redemptions, during fiscal year 

2019

.

On 

July 31, 2020

, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Legg Mason for a purchase consideration of 

$4.5 billion

 in cash and 

$0.2 billion

 related to the settlement of historical compensation arrangements. During the fiscal year 

2020

, we completed additional acquisitions with a total purchase consideration of 

$94.8 million

 in cash, including the acquisitions of Pennsylvania Trust Company, AdvisorEngine Inc., Athena Capital Advisors, LLC and Onsa, Inc. On 

February 1, 2019

, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in BSP for a purchase consideration of 

$720.1 million

 in cash.

Table of Contents

In February 

2020

, we purchased an office building in Edinburgh, Scotland with a total cost of approximately 

$40 million

. During fiscal year 

2019

, we completed construction of two new buildings at our corporate headquarters campus in San Mateo, California with a total cost of approximately 

$130 million

 and purchased an office building in Poznan, Poland with a total cost of approximately 

$86 million

. The buildings are used in our business operations, and portions of the Edinburgh building and California campus are leased to third parties.

The funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. Current increased liquidity risks and redemptions in these funds have required, and may continue to require, increased cash in the form of loans or other lines of credit to help settle redemptions and for other related purposes. While we have no legal or contractual obligation to do so, we have in certain instances voluntarily elected to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. In 

April 2020

, we authorized loans aggregating up to 

5.0 billion

 Indian Rupees (approximately 

$66.2 million

) to certain sponsored funds in India that had experienced increased liquidity risks and redemptions and that are subject to the decision of the fund’s trustee to wind up the funds. See Note 

16

 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information. The loans have a fixed interest rate of 

8.0%

 per annum, are secured by the funds’ assets and are due upon demand. At 

September 30, 2020

, the loans have an aggregate outstanding balance of 

$42.4 million

, and the remaining authorization available is approximately 

$4.9 million

. We did not provide financial or other support to our sponsored funds during fiscal year 

2019

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Further, global concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and we expect will continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations including the estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ from the estimates. Described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. For additional information about our accounting policies, see Note 

1

 – Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. 

 57

Table of Contents

Consolidation 

We consolidate our subsidiaries and investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity (“VOE”) or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”).

A VIE is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. The assessment of whether an entity is a VIE or VOE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. When performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entity

’

s legal organization and capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. Substantially all of our VIEs are investment products and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and investment management fees earned from these products.

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE

’

s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Investment management fees earned from VIEs are excluded from the primary beneficiary determination if they are deemed to be at market and commensurate with service. The key estimates and assumptions used in the analyses include the amount of AUM and the life of the investment product. These estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. For example, AUM is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, distributions to investors and reinvested distributions. There is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VIEs’ economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. As of 

September 30, 2020

, we were the primary beneficiary of 43 investment product VIEs.

Business Combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for by recognizing the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition-date estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition-date fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings.

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist primarily of investment management contracts and trade names. The fair values of the acquired management contracts are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the contracts, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. The fair value of trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method based on net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about royalty rate, revenue growth rate, discount rate and effective tax rate. Our estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, may differ from actual results. 

The Company’s management contract intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 

three

 to 

fifteen

 years, using the straight-line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent contracts to manage investment assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period. Trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from five to twenty years using the straight-line method.

On July 31, 2020, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Legg Mason common stock for purchase consideration of 

$4.5 billion

 in cash and 

$0.2 billion

 related to the settlement of historical compensation arrangements, and recognized 

$2.3 billion

 of goodwill, 

$2.7 billion

 of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to investment management contracts and 

$1.4 billion

 of definite-lived intangible assets primarily related to investment management contracts and trade names.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. We have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned. We make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment.

 58

Table of Contents

We may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. A quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. Quantitative tests compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. 

The fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin and the discount rate. 

We performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of August 1, 

2020

. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill and a substantial portion of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the specific intangible assets exceeds their carrying value. We performed a quantitative test for approximately 21% of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recognized 

$30.0 million

 of impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company recognized $23.7 million of impairment of goodwill directly attributable to the Company’s decision to wind-down Onsa, Inc. which was acquired on October 24, 2019 and had not been integrated into the Company. The impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets were primarily due to a reduction in the revenue growth rate assumption for a Benefit Street Partners’ private debt fund resulting from declines in interest rates and continued market volatility. The estimated fair values of substantially all of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 47%. We estimated the discounted future cash flows for indefinite-lived intangible assets using compounded annual AUM growth rates ranging from (10.0%) to 11.6%, which were developed taking into account ongoing volatility in the capital markets, and a discount rate of 8.1%, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital. A hypothetical 200 basis point decline in the AUM growth rates or a 200 basis point increase in the discount rate would not reduce the estimated fair values of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets below their carrying values. 

We subsequently monitored market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that the other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We considered, among other things, changes in our AUM and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the impairment tests as of August 1, 

2020

. We also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. Subsequent to August 1, 

2020

, there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate these assets might be impaired. 

We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is evaluated based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows using assumptions about the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, average effective fee rate and expected useful life as well as royalty rate for trade name intangible assets. The most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the AUM growth rate. If the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows, impairment is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset’s fair value, as determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type. We recognized 

$1.7 million

 of impairment of definite-lived intangible assets during fiscal year 

2020

 related to Edinburgh Partners management contracts due to the loss of a significant mandate.

While we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the assumptions could result in recognition of impairment.

Fair Value Measurements 

A substantial amount of our investments is recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. We use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. The assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. See Note

 – Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on the fair value hierarchy.

As of 

September 30, 2020

, Level 3 assets represented 

24%

 of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to CIPs

’

 investments in equity and debt securities, and real estate. There were 

$2.3 million

 of transfers into and 

$1.1 million

 of transfers out of Level 3 during fiscal year 

2020

.

The following are descriptions of the significant assets measured at fair value and their fair value methodologies.

Sponsored funds and separate accounts

 consist primarily of investments in nonconsolidated sponsored funds and to a lesser extent, separate accounts. Changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair values of funds are determined based on their published NAV or estimated using NAV as a practical expedient. The fair values of separate accounts are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available.

Investments related to long-term incentive plans

 consist primarily of investments in sponsored funds related to certain compensation plans that have certain vesting provisions. Changes in fair value are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair values of the investments are determined based on the funds’ published NAV or estimated using NAV as a practical expedient.

Other equity and debt securities

 consist of other equity investment securities and debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale. Changes in the fair value of other equity and trading debt securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized, at which time they are recognized in earnings using the average cost method. The fair values of equity securities other than funds are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on discounted cash flows using significant unobservable inputs. The fair values of debt securities are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on discounted cash flows using significant unobservable inputs.

Investments of CIPs 

consist of marketable debt and equity securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. Changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair values of marketable securities are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. The investments that are not generally traded in active markets consist of equity and debt securities of entities in emerging markets, fund products, other equity and debt instruments, real estate and loans. The fair values are determined using significant unobservable inputs in either a market-based or income-based approach, except for fund products, for which fair values are estimated using NAV as a practical expedient.

Noncontrolling interests 

consist of third-party equity interests in CIPs and minority interests in certain subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the noncontrolling interest holders and are classified as temporary equity at fair value, except when the fair value is less than the issuance date fair value, the reported amount is the issuance date fair value. Changes in fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests do not permit the noncontrolling interest holders to request settlement, are reported at their issuance value and undistributed net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

The fair value of third-party equity interests in CIPs are determined based on the published NAV or estimated using NAV a practical expedient. The fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to minority interest in certain subsidiaries are derived using discounted cash flows and guideline public company methodology, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate and operating income multiples.

Revenues 

We earn revenue primarily from providing investment management and related services to our customers. In addition to investment management, services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. Revenues are recognized when our obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. The obligations are satisfied over time as the services are rendered, except for the sales and distribution obligations for the sale of shares of sponsored funds, which are satisfied on trade date. Multiple services included in customer contracts are accounted for separately when the obligations are determined to be distinct. Management judgement is involved in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in the identification of distinct services.

Fees from providing investment management and fund administration services (“investment management fees”), other than performance-based investment management fees, are determined based on a percentage of AUM, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average AUM, and are recognized as the services are performed over time. Performance-based investment management fees are generated when investment products’ performance exceeds targets established in customer contracts. These fees are recognized when the amount is no longer probable of significant reversal and may relate to investment management services that were provided in prior periods. 

Sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. Sales commissions are based on contractual rates for sales of certain classes of sponsored funds and are recognized on trade date. Distribution service fees are determined based on a percentage of AUM, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average AUM. As the fee amounts are uncertain on trade date, they are recognized over time as the amounts become known and may relate to sales and distribution services provided in prior periods.

AUM is generally based on the fair value of the underlying securities held by investment products and is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. The fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are valued internally using various methodologies which incorporate significant unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type. Pricing of the securities is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events.

As substantially all of our AUM is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our AUM. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. 

As a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the U.S. and generate earnings worldwide. We repatriate the foreign earnings that are in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements of all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Loss Contingencies 

We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. In management’s opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of 

September 30, 2020

 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. See also Note
