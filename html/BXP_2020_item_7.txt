Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

The following table presents the aggregate carrying value of our mortgage notes payable, net, unsecured senior notes, net, unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan, net and our corresponding estimate of fair value as of December 31, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately $12.5 billion of these borrowings bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates.  As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR plus 0.95% (1.10%) per annum.  The following table presents our aggregate fixed rate debt obligations with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date and our aggregate variable rate debt obligations sorted by maturity date.  

The table below does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt.  For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “

On February 14, 2021, BPLP completed the redemption of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.125% senior notes due May 15, 2021.  The redemption price was approximately $858.7 million, which was equal to par plus approximately $8.7 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. 

At December 31, 2020, the weighted-average coupon/stated rates on the fixed rate debt stated above was 3.65% per annum.  At December 31, 2020, our outstanding variable rate debt based on LIBOR totaled approximately $500.0 million.  At December 31, 2020, the coupon/stated rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 1.10% per annum.  If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

The fair value amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments.  Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.

Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.  In the event that LIBOR is discontinued, the interest rate for our variable rate debt and our unconsolidated joint ventures’ variable rate debt and the swap rate for our unconsolidated joint ventures’ interest rate swaps following such event will be based on an alternative variable rate as specified in the applicable documentation governing such debt or swaps or as otherwise agreed upon. Such an event would not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or our unconsolidated joint ventures’ ability to maintain its outstanding swaps, but the alternative variable rate could be higher and more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance.  We understand that LIBOR is expected to remain available through the end of 2021, but may be discontinued or otherwise become unavailable thereafter.
