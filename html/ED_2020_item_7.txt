Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts

The Companies continue to respond to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic by working to reduce the potential risks posed by its spread to employees, customers and other stakeholders. The Companies continue to employ an incident command structure led by a pandemic planning team. The Companies support employee health and facility hygiene through mandatory pre-entry symptom surveys for employees arriving at all company locations, regular cleaning and disinfecting of all work and common areas, promoting social distancing and directing employees to work remotely whenever possible. Employees who test positive for COVID-19 are directed to quarantine at home and are evaluated for close, prolonged contact with other employees that would require those employees to quarantine at home. Following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, sick or quarantined employees return to work when they can safely do so. The Utilities continue to provide critical electric, gas and steam service to customers during the pandemic. Additional safety protocols have been implemented to protect employees, customers and the public, when work at customer premises is required. As a result of COVID-19 clusters that have arisen in various areas of New York within the Utilities’ service territory, the Utilities have limited their work in customer premises in the impacted areas to only address emergency, safety-related and selected service connections requested by customers. The Companies have procured an inventory of pandemic-related materials to address anticipated future needs and maintain regular communications with key suppliers.  

Below is additional information related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Companies’ actions. Also, see

 “COVID-19 Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Impact of CARES Act and 2021 Appropriations Act on Accounting for Income Taxes 

In response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act became law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act has several key business tax relief measures that may present potential cash benefits and/or refund opportunities for Con Edison and its subsidiaries, including permitting a five-year carryback of a net operating loss (NOL) for tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, temporary removal of the 80 percent limitation of NOL carryforwards against taxable income for tax years before 2021, temporary relaxation of the limitations on interest deductions, Employee Retention Tax Credit and deferral of payments of employer payroll taxes.

Con Edison carried back its NOL of $29 million from tax year 2018 to tax year 2013. This allowed Con Edison, mostly at the Clean Energy Businesses, to receive a $2.5 million net tax refund and to recognize a discrete income tax benefit of $4 million in 2020, due to the higher federal statutory tax rate in 2013. See "Income Tax" in Note L. Con Edison and its subsidiaries did not have a federal NOL in tax years 2019 or 2020.  

Con Edison and its subsidiaries benefited by the increase in the percentage for calculating the limitation on the interest expense deduction from 30 percent of Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI) to 50 percent of ATI in 2019 and 2020, which allowed the Companies to deduct 100 percent of their interest expense.  

The Companies qualify for an employee retention tax credit created under the CARES Act for "eligible employers" related to governmental authorities imposing restrictions that partially suspended their operations for a portion of their workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Companies continued to pay them. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Con Edison and CECONY recognized a tax benefit to Taxes, other than income taxes of $10 million and $7 million, respectively.  

The CARES Act also allows employers to defer payments of the employer share of Social Security payroll taxes that would have otherwise been owed from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The Companies deferred the payment of employer payroll taxes for the period April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 of approximately $71 million ($63 million of which is for CECONY). The Companies will repay half of this liability by December 31, 2021 and the other half by December 31, 2022. 

In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the 2021 Appropriations Act)  was signed into law. The 2021 Appropriations Act, among other things, extends the expiring employee retention tax credit to include qualified wages paid in the first two quarters of 2021, increases the qualified wages paid to an employee from 50 percent up to $10,000 annually in 2020 to 70 percent up to $10,000 per quarter in 2021 and increases the maximum employee retention tax credit amount an employer can take per employee from $5,000 in 2020 to $14,000 in the first two quarters of 2021.  

Accounting Considerations 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent New York State on PAUSE and related executive orders, decline in business, bankruptcies, layoffs and furloughs, among other factors, both commercial and residential customers may have increased difficulty paying their utility bills. CECONY and O&R have existing allowances for uncollectible accounts established against their customer accounts receivable balances that are reevaluated each quarter and updated accordingly. Changes to the Utilities’ reserve balances that result in write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances are not reflected in rates during the term of the current rate plans. During 2020, the potential economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was also considered in forward-looking projections related to write-off and recovery rates, resulting in increases to the customer allowance for uncollectible accounts as detailed herein. CECONY’s and O&R’s allowances for uncollectible customer accounts reserve increased from $65 million and $4.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $138 million and $8.7 million at December 31, 2020, respectively. See Note A and "COVID-19 Regulatory Matters" in Note B to the Financial Statements in Item 8. 

The Companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever there is a triggering event, and test long-lived and intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable. The Companies identified no triggering events or changes in circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic that would indicate that the carrying value of goodwill, long-lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable at December 31, 2020. See Notes A and K to the financial statements in Item 8.

Liquidity and Financing 

The Companies continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets closely, including borrowing rates and daily cash collections. The Companies have been able to access the capital markets as needed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. See Notes C and D to the financial statements

in Item 8. However, a continued economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could increase the amount of capital needed by the Utilities and the costs of such capital.

The decline in business activity in the Utilities’ service territory as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower billed sales revenues in 2020 and a slower recovery in cash of outstanding customer accounts receivable balances and is expected to continue to do so in 2021. The Utilities’ rate plans have revenue decoupling mechanisms in their New York electric and gas businesses that largely reconcile actual energy delivery revenues to the authorized delivery revenues approved by the NYSPSC per month and accumulate the deferred balances semi-annually under CECONY's electric rate plan (January through June and July through December, respectively) and annually under CECONY's gas rate plan and O&R New York's electric and gas rate plans (January through December). Differences are accrued with interest each month for CECONY's and O&R New York’s electric customers and after the annual deferral period ends for CECONY's and O&R New York’s gas customers for refund to, or recovery from customers, as applicable. Generally, the refund to or recovery from customers begins August and February of each year over an ensuing six-month period for CECONY's electric customers and February of each year over an ensuing twelve-month period for CECONY's gas and O&R New York's electric and gas customers. Although these revenue decoupling mechanisms are in place, lower billed sales revenues and higher uncollectible accounts have reduced and is expected to continue to reduce liquidity at the Utilities.

 Also, in March 2020, the Utilities began suspending service disconnections, certain collection notices, final bill collection agency activity, new late payment charges and certain other fees for all customers and such suspensions may continue through 2021 or later. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the estimated foregone revenues that were not collected by the Utilities were approximately $61 million for CECONY and $3 million for O&R. These foregone revenues have reduced and may continue to reduce liquidity at the Utilities.  See Note A and "COVID-19 Regulatory Matters" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

Con Edison and the Utilities also have a $2,250 million credit agreement (Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until December 2023 ($2,200 million of commitments from December 2022). Con Edison and the Utilities have not entered into any loans under the Credit Agreement. See Note D to the financial statements in Item 8.

(a)

Revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved.

(b)

“Residential/Religious” generally includes single-family dwellings, individual apartments in multi-family dwellings, religious organizations and certain other not-for-profit organizations.

(c)

Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in the revenue decoupling mechanism current asset or regulatory liability and changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with other provisions of the company’s rate plan.

(d)

After adjusting for variations, primarily weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in the company’s service area decreased 6.1 percent in 2020 compared with 2019. See “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts,” above.

Operating revenues

 increased $41 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($81 million), offset in part by lower fuel expenses ($24 million) and lower revenues from the electric rate plan ($16 million).

Purchased power

 expenses increased $81 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to higher unit costs ($158 million), offset in part by lower purchased volumes ($77 million).

62

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Fuel

 expenses decreased $24 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower unit costs ($31 million), offset in part by higher purchased volumes from the company’s electric generating facilities ($7 million).

Other operations and maintenance

 expenses decreased $306 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower costs for pension and other postretirement benefits ($195 million), lower surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers ($110 million), lower stock-based compensation ($25 million) and lower healthcare costs 

($16 million), offset in part by incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic ($14 million), higher municipal infrastructure support costs ($9 million) and food and medicine spoilage claims related to outages caused by Tropical Storm Isaias ($7 million).

Depreciation and amortization

 increased $161 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher electric utility plant balances and higher depreciation rates.

Taxes, other than income taxes

 increased $156 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher property taxes ($105 million), lower deferral of under-collected property taxes ($38 million), higher state and local taxes ($11 million) and the absence in 2020 of a reduction in the sales and use tax reserve upon conclusion of the audit assessment ($5 million), offset in part by lower payroll taxes ($3 million) due to the Employee Retention Tax Credit created under the CARES Act. See “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts - Impact of CARES Act and 2021 Appropriations Act on Accounting for Income Taxes,” above.

Operating revenues

 decreased $96 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower gas purchased for resale expense ($180 million) and certain rate plan reconciliations ($6 million), offset in part by higher gas revenues due to the gas base rates increase in January 2020 under the company's gas rate plan ($91 million).

Gas purchased for resale

 decreased $180 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower unit costs ($110 million) and lower purchased volumes ($70 million).

Other operations and maintenance

 expenses decreased $44 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower costs for pension and other postretirement benefits ($31 million), lower stock-based compensation ($5 million), lower municipal infrastructure support costs ($5 million) and lower reserve for injuries and damages ($4 million).

Depreciation and amortization

 increased $63 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher gas utility plant balances and higher depreciation rates.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other income (deductions) decreased $136 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher costs associated with components of pension and other postretirement benefits other than service cost ($117 million) and the absence of the company’s share of gain on sale of properties in 2019 ($14 million).

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased $11 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher interest on long-term debt ($46 million), offset in part by a decrease in interest accrued on the TCJA related regulatory liability ($13 million), lower interest expense for short-term debt ($12 million) and lower interest accrued on the system benefit charge liability ($8 million).

Income Tax Expense

Income taxes decreased $120 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower income before income tax expense ($39 million), an increase in the amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes due to CECONY’s electric and gas rate plans that went into effect in January 2020 ($103 million) and lower state income taxes ($13 million), offset in part by the absence of the amortization of excess deferred state income taxes in 2020 ($24 million), lower research and development credits in 2020 ($5 million) and lower flow-through tax benefits in 2020 for plant-related items ($4 million).

Revenues from New York electric delivery sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s electric sales in New Jersey are not subject to a decoupling mechanism, and as a result, changes in such volumes do impact revenues.

(b)

“Residential/Religious” generally includes single-family dwellings, individual apartments in multi-family dwellings, religious organizations and certain other not-for-profit organizations.

(c)

Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in the revenue decoupling mechanism current asset or regulatory liability in accordance with the company’s New York electric rate plan and changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company’s electric rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

(d)

After adjusting for weather and other variations, electric delivery volumes in company’s service area decreased 0.7 percent in 2020 compared with 2019. See “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts,” above.

Operating revenues

 decreased $5 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($19 million), offset in part by higher revenues from the New York electric rate plan ($16 million).

Purchased

 expenses decreased $19 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower unit costs.

Other operations and maintenance

 expenses increased $7 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to the amortization of prior deferred storm costs ($3 million) and food and medicine spoilage claims related to outages caused by Tropical Storm Isaias ($3 million).

Depreciation and amortization

 increased $5 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher electric utility plant balances.

Taxes, other than income taxes

 increased $1 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher property taxes ($2 million), offset in part by lower payroll taxes ($1 million).

Operating revenues

 decreased $121 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower wholesale revenues ($136 million) and lower energy services revenues ($19 million), offset in part by higher renewable electric production revenues ($34 million). 

Gas purchased for resale

 decreased $144 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower purchased volumes.

Other operations and maintenance

 expenses increased $5 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to an increase in general operating expenses.

Depreciation and amortization

 increased $5 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to an increase in renewable electric production projects in operation during 2020.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased $10 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher unrealized losses on interest rate swaps in the 2020 period.

Income Tax Expense

Income taxes increased $14 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher income before income tax expense ($1 million), lower income attributable to non-controlling interest ($13 million), and the absence of the adjustment for prior period federal income tax returns primarily due to higher research and development credits in 2019 ($13 million), offset in part by a tax benefit due to the change in the federal corporate income tax rate recognized for a loss carryback from the 2018 tax year to the 2013 tax year as allowed under the CARES Act ($4 million), a lower increase in uncertain tax position ($7 million) and higher renewable energy credits ($2 million).

Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest

Income attributable to non-controlling interest increased $54 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower losses attributable in the 2020 period to a tax equity investor in renewable electric production projects accounted for under the HLBV method of accounting. See Note R to the financial statements in Item 8.

Con Edison Transmission

Net Interest Expense 

Net interest expense decreased $7 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to a reduction to short-term borrowings and rates charged under an intercompany capital funding facility. 

Other Income (Deductions)

Other income (deductions) decr

eased $319 million in 2020

 compared with 2019 primarily due to an impairment loss related to Con Edison Transmission's investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. See "Application of Critical Account Policies - Investments" in Item 7 and "Investments" in Note A to the financial statement in Item 8. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income taxes decreased $87 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to the MVP impairment loss recorded in 2020 ($88 million).

68

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Other

Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes, other than income taxes

 

increased $7 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to adjustments made to the New York City capital tax for prior periods in the 2020 period. 

Other Income (Deductions)

Other income (deductions) increased $7 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to the absence in 2020 of an elimination related to interest income under the intercompany capital funding facility. 

Income Tax Expense

Income taxes decreased $17 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower income before income tax expense 

(

$3 million), the reversal of a portion of a New York City valuation allowance ($9 million), and the MVP impairment loss recorded in 2020 ($9 million), offset in part by lower consolidated state income tax benefits ($4 million). 

During the fourth quarter of 2020, Con Edison reversed a portion of its valuation allowance that was recorded against the deferred tax asset established for the New York City NOL. Management has reassessed its ability to realize a portion of the deferred tax benefits generated primarily by its renewable energy projects due to the future reversal of temporary differences associated with the accelerated tax depreciation and by implementing its strategy to secure tax equity financing from third parties for which certain tax deductions and amortization will be specifically allocated to members outside of the consolidated group.

 expenses increased $3 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher municipal infrastructure support costs ($7 million), higher costs for pension and other postretirement benefits ($8 million) and stock-based compensation ($2 million), offset in part by the absence in 2019 of property damage, clean-up and other response costs related to a steam main rupture in 2018 ($11 million).

72

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Depreciation and amortization

 increased $2 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher steam utility plant balances.

Taxes, other than income taxes

 increased $10 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher property taxes ($12 million) and the absence of a New York State sales and use tax refund received in 2018 ($1 million), offset in part by lower state and local taxes ($1 million), higher deferral of under-collected property taxes ($1 million) and the reduction in the sales and use tax reserve upon conclusion of an audit assessment ($1 million).

Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes

At $2,295 million, taxes other than income taxes remain one of CECONY’s largest operating expenses. The principal components of, and variations in, taxes other than income taxes were:

Other Income (Deductions)

Other income (deductions) increased $108 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower costs associated with components of pension and other postretirement benefits other than service cost.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased $39 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher interest expense for long-term ($10 million) and short-term ($6 million) debt, an increase in interest accrued on the TCJA related regulatory liability ($9 million) and interest accrued on the system benefit charge liability ($8 million).

Income Tax Expense

Income taxes increased $9 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher income before income tax expense ($13 million) and lower tax benefits in 2019 for plant-related flow through items ($7 million), offset in part by an increase in the amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes due to the TCJA ($11 million).

Revenues from New York electric delivery sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s electric sales in New Jersey are not subject to a decoupling mechanism, and as a result, changes in such volumes do impact revenues.

(b)

“Residential/Religious” generally includes single-family dwellings, individual apartments in multi-family dwellings, religious organizations and certain other not-for-profit organizations.

(c)

Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in the revenue decoupling mechanism current asset or regulatory liability in accordance with the company’s New York electric rate plan and changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company’s electric rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

(d)

After adjusting for weather and other variations, electric delivery volumes in company’s service area decreased 1.1 percent in 2019 compared with 2018.

Operating revenues

 decreased $8 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower purchased power expenses.

Purchased power

 expenses decreased $20 million in 2019 compared with 2018 due to lower unit costs ($21 million), offset in part by higher purchased volumes ($1 million).

Other operations and maintenance

 expenses increased $2 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to a regulatory change in accounting for manufactured gas plant spending ($5 million) and higher stock-based compensation ($2 million), offset in part by the reduction of a regulatory asset associated with certain site investigation and remediation costs in 2018 ($6 million).

Depreciation and amortization

 increased $4 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher electric utility plant balances.

Taxes, other than income taxes

 increased $1 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher property taxes.

(a) See Note V to the financial statements in Item 8.

Operating revenues

 increased $94 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher revenues from renewable electric production projects resulting from the December 2018 acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC, including the consolidation of certain jointly-owned projects that were previously accounted for as equity investments ($340 million), offset in part by lower wholesale revenues ($144 million), lower engineering, procurement and construction services revenues due to the completion in 2018 of a solar electric production project developed for another company ($92 million) and lower energy services revenues ($24 million). Net mark-to-market values increased ($14 million).

Purchased power

 expenses decreased $2 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the absence in the 2019 period of the true-ups relating to the retail electric supply business sold in 2016.

Gas purchased for resale

 decreased $128 million in 2019 compared with 2018 due to lower purchased volumes.

Other operations and maintenance

 expenses decreased $64 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower engineering, procurement and construction costs ($82 million) and lower energy services costs ($18 million), offset in part by higher costs associated with additional renewable electric production projects in operation resulting from the December 2018 acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC ($26 million).

Depreciation and amortization

 increased $141 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to an increase in renewable electric production projects resulting from the December 2018 acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC (including the consolidation of certain jointly-owned projects that the Clean Energy Businesses previously accounted for as equity method investments).

Taxes, other than income taxes

 increased $8 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher property taxes associated with additional renewable electric production projects in operation resulting from the December 2018 acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC.

Gain on acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC

 decreased $131 million in 2019 compared with 2018 due to the absence in 2019 of the gain recognized in 2018 with respect to jointly-owned renewable energy production projects upon completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See Note V to the financial statements in Item 8.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other income (deductions) decreased $28 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the absence in 2019 of equity income from certain jointly-owned projects that were accounted for as equity investments in 2018 but consolidated after the December 2018 acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC.

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased $123 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to an increase in debt resulting from the December 2018 acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC, including $825 million that was borrowed to fund a portion of the purchase price, $576 million of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC subsidiaries' project debt that was outstanding at the time of the acquisition and the consolidation of $506 million of project debt of certain jointly-owned projects that the Clean Energy Businesses previously accounted for as equity method investments

.

Income Tax Expense

Income taxes decreased $77 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower income before income tax expense (excluding income attributable to non-controlling interest) ($50 million), higher renewable energy credits ($7 million), lower state income taxes ($11 million), adjustments for prior period federal income tax returns primarily due to increased research and development credits ($11 million) and lower valuation allowances on state net operating losses ($6 million), offset in part by an increase in uncertain tax positions ($9 million).

Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest

Income attributable to non-controlling interest increased $97 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the income attributable in the 2019 period to a tax equity investor in renewable electric production projects accounted for under the HLBV method of accounting. See Note R to the financial statements in Item 8.

Con Edison Transmission

Other Income (Deductions)

Other income (deductions) increased $13 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher allowance for funds used during construction from the Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC ($27 million), offset in part by lower contract renewal rates at Stagecoach Gas Services, LLC ($17 million). See “Con Edison Transmission - CET Gas” in Item 1.

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased $5 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to funding of increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC.

Income Tax Expense

Income taxes increased $4 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher income before income tax expense ($2 million) and a decrease in the amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes due to the TCJA ($1 million).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Companies’ liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.

The principal factors affecting Con Edison’s liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.

The principal factors affecting CECONY’s liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.

The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities’ cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.

Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See “The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements,” "Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies," “The Companies Face Risks Related to Health Epidemics And Other Outbreaks, Including The COVID-19 Pandemic,” and “The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control” in Item 1A, and “Capital Requirements and Resources” in Item 1.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The Utilities’ cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is primarily affected by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. See "Competition" and "Environmental Matters – Clean Energy Future – Reforming the Energy Vision" and “Environmental Matters – Climate Change” in Item 1. During 2020, the decline in business activity in the Utilities’ service territory due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted and may continue in 2021 to result in lower billed sales revenues, a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances and increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts, that may further result in increases to write-offs of customer accounts. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities’ New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows, but generally not net income. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities’ cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities’ New York rate plans allow them to defer costs resulting from a change in legislation, regulation and related actions that have taken effect during the term of the rate plans once the costs exceed a specified threshold. Increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been deferred pursuant to the legislative, regulatory and related actions provisions of their rate plans. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, credits to their customers of the net benefits of the TCJA, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, decrease cash flows from operating activities. See “Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies,” in Item 1A, “Federal Income Tax” in Note A, “Rate Plans” in Note B, "COVID-19 Regulatory Matters" in Note B, “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8 and "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts - Liquidity and Financing," above.

Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies’ cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense, amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and accrued unbilled revenue. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities’ New York electric and gas rate plans. See “Rate Plans – CECONY– Electric and Gas" and "Rate Plans – O&R New York – Electric and Gas” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. For Con Edison, 2020 net income also included a non-cash loss recognized with respect to a partial impairment of Con Edison Transmission’s investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC.

 

See “Investments” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. For Con Edison, 2018 net income included a non-cash gain recognized with respect to jointly-owned renewable energy production projects upon completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC at the Clean Energy Businesses ($131 million). See Note V to the financial statements in Item 8.

Net cash flows from operating activities in 2020 for Con Edison and CECONY were $936 million and $809 million lower, respectively, than in 2019. The changes in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY primarily reflects higher accounts receivable balances from customers ($566 million and $519 million, respectively)

 (see “COVID-19 Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8 and “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts - Accounting Considerations” and “Liquidity and Financing,” above) and higher other receivables and other current assets ($188 million and $103 million, respectively) primarily due to lower reimbursement received for restoration costs related to the restoration of power in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the September 2017 hurricanes in the 2020 period ($94 million and $88 million, respectively), higher system benefit charge ($139 million and $130 million, respectively), higher pension and retiree benefit contributions ($121 million and $113 million, respectively), deferrals for increased costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic ($115 million and $113 million, respectively), and a change in pension and retiree benefit obligations ($72 million and $77 million, respectively), offset in part by lower TCJA net benefits provided to customers in the 2020 period ($263 million and $263 million, respectively).

The change in noncurrent liabilities primarily reflects a change in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits that primarily reflects timing differences associated with investments in partnerships.

Equity at December 31, 2020 was $186 million lower than at December 31, 2019. The change in equity reflects net loss for the year ($175 million) and common stock dividends to parent ($11 million) in 2020.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2020, none of the Companies’ transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.

Regulatory Matters

For information about the Utilities’ rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see “Utility Regulation” in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

 

Risk Factors

The Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

The Companies’ financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies’ critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, cloud computing implementation costs, derivative instruments and investments.

Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities

The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.

The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges, or “regulatory assets,” under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits, or “regulatory liabilities,” under the accounting rules for regulated operations.

The Utilities’ principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities' regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 are recoverable from customers, or to be applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions that have been approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.

In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2020, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $6,461 million and $5,989 million, respectively.

Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission also provide such benefits to transferred employees who previously worked for the Utilities. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies’ pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody’s or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.

In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.

The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison’s and CECONY’s current estimates for 2021 are increases, compared with 2020, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $15 million and $13 million, respectively.

 

The following table illustrates the effect on 2021 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:

A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2021, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.00 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $29 million and $27 million, respectively, in 2022.

Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.

The Companies’ policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2020 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2020 of $435 million and $40 million, respectively. In 2021, CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $441 million and $39 million, respectively. See “Expected Contributions” in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.

Accounting for Contingencies

The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities’ responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal 

88

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020

tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G) and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.

The Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers’ compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.

Accounting for Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

The accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. 

In January 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The output of certain of the Clean Energy Businesses' renewable electric production projects is sold to PG&E under long-term power purchase agreements. As a result of the PG&E bankruptcy, distributions from the related projects to the Clean Energy Businesses were restricted and PG&E-related project debt was reclassified on Con Edison’s consolidated balance sheet from long-term debt to long-term debt due within one year. In July 2020, PG&E’s plan of reorganization became effective and the Clean Energy Businesses began receiving previously restricted distributions and all related project debt with a maturity longer than one year was reclassified to long-term debt.  See “Long-Lived and Intangible Assets” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

Accounting for Cloud Computing Implementation Costs

The accounting rules for costs incurred in implementing cloud computing arrangements allow for capitalization of such costs in the same manner as prepaid assets are recorded. Depreciation on the assets is recorded as other operations and maintenance expense. See "Other Deferred Charges and Noncurrent Assets and Prepayments" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments

The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. The Clean Energy Businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks,” below and Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.

Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.

Investments

The accounting rules require Con Edison to periodically evaluate its equity method investments, to determine whether they are impaired. The standard for determining whether an impairment exists and must be recorded is whether an other-than-temporary decline in carrying value has occurred. The evaluation and measurement of impairments involve uncertainties. The estimates that Con Edison makes with respect to its equity method investments are based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable, and variations in these estimates or the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on whether a triggering event is determined to exist or the amount of any such impairment. Additionally, if the projects in which Con Edison holds these investments recognize an impairment, Con Edison may record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value.

Con Edison evaluated its equity method investments as of December 31, 2020 and concluded that the fair value of its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP) declined below its carrying value and the decline is other-than-temporary. Accordingly, Con Edison recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $320 million ($223 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2020 that reduced the carrying value of its investment in MVP from $662 million to $342 million. See “Investments” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

There is risk that the carrying value of Con Edison’s investments in MVP may be further or fully impaired in the future. There are ongoing legal and regulatory matters that must be resolved favorably before the Mountain Valley Pipeline can be completed. Assumptions and estimates used to test Con Edison’s investments in MVP for impairment may change if adverse or delayed resolutions to these matters were to occur, which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of Con Edison’s investment in MVP. Also, Con Edison is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its 50 percent interest in Stagecoach Gas Services, LLC. As such strategic alternatives are evaluated, Con Edison may be required to determine whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred for its Stagecoach investment.

At December 31, 2020, Con Edison’s consolidated balance sheet included investments of $1,816 million. See “Investments” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

Financial and Commodity Market Risks

The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.

Interest Rate Risk

The Companies' interest rate risk primarily relates to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities, and variable-rate debt. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Clean Energy Businesses use interest rate swaps to exchange variable-rate project financed debt for a fixed interest rate. See Note P to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2020, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $1 million. Under CECONY’s current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.

Commodity Price Risk

Con Edison’s commodity price risk primarily relates to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.

Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2020, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $87 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $81 million is for CECONY and $6 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Clean Energy Businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level, compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was as follows:

Investment Risk

The Companies’ investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Con Edison's investment risk also relates to the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies – Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” above and “Investments” in Note A and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 

The Companies’ current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 45 to 55 percent equity securities, 33 to 43 percent debt securities and 10 to 14 percent real estate. At December 31, 2020, the pension plan investments consisted of 51 percent equity securities, 38 percent debt securities and 11 percent real estate.

For the Utilities’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its New York rate plans.

Environmental Matters

For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see “Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.

Impact of Inflation

The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies’ long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.

Material Contingencies

For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies’ material contingencies, see “Application of Critical Accounting Policies – Accounting for Contingencies,” above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.
